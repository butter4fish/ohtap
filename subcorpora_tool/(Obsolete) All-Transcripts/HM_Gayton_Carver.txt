Story_ID: 484687
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and then your father's [John J. Gayton] side of the family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, okay.
Speaker 1: We'll cover both of them, we'll do them one at a time.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Virginia, V-I-R-G-I-N-I-A, Clark Gayton.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1903 in Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: All right, now we were talking about your mother Virginia Clark Gayton.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She was born 1905 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen o'three [1903].
Speaker 1: Nineteen o'three [1903], okay, in Nashville.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna check on that, it might be 1902, but I'll check on that to make sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so she was born in Nashville?
Speaker 2: Nashville, that's right.
Speaker 1: What do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace those ancestors?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, we can trace back her grandfather.  His name was Lewis Clarke.  He was born in 1815.
Speaker 1: Is there a significance there?  I mean Lewis Clarke sounds like Lewis and Clark [Meriwether Lewis and William Clark]?
Speaker 2: Well there is a significance in that he was one of the prominent black abolitionists in the 1840s and 1850s, and he wrote a slave narrative ['Narratives of the Sufferings of Lewis and Milton Clarke, Sons of a Soldier of the Revolution, During a Captivity of More than Twenty Years Among the Slaveholders of Kentucky, One of the So-Called Christian States of North America,' Lewis Clarke and Milton Clarke] in 1846, which was close to the same year that Frederick Douglass had his slave narrative written.
Speaker 1: Now where was he based?
Speaker 2: Well he was in Campbell County, Kentucky, and he was what would be called an octoroon, but obviously still regarded, you know, as black, and his mother bore a child with the owner of the plantation there in Campbell County.  But his father, Lewis Clarke's father was a Scotsman who, as the story goes, fought in the Revolutionary War at Bunker Hill [Battle of Bunker Hill], and was born in Scotland and in my great-grandfather's slave narrative, he talked about his father, you know, singing, you know, Scottish lullabies to him when he was a child.  But Lewis Clarke was a major player in the abolitionist movement and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So was he born in slavery?
Speaker 2: He was born in slavery.
Speaker 1: All right, and then he escaped?
Speaker 2: Well the--he was supposed to once his grandfather passed on, the owner of the plantation passed on they--he was to be freed, but the white sons, sons and daughters of the plantation owner, once he died, they reneged on what was in his will.
Speaker 1: Now those are actually his half brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's correct, right, but he would take his brothers and sisters out of Kentucky on--into Ohio and in a couple of cases on into Canada, into Windsor, Ontario [Canada] for the most part, and word of his exploits in terms of how he was treated as a slave, and the fact that he was bringing his, some of his relatives out of slavery.
Story_ID: 484688
Speaker 1: The word got to the author of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' Harriet Beecher Stowe, and as the story goes he had about twelve conversations with her, and as a result those conversations were reflected in the book of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' in--one of the main characters was George Harris, and so if one looks at the key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, Lewis Clarke's name is there as the character within that book, George Harris within that book (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's very interesting.  Okay, okay.  So he was an inspiration for Harriet Beecher Stowe--she was right there in Cincinnati [Ohio], between Kentucky and Ohio?
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: What you're saying is, if I'm getting this straight is that he returned to Kentucky, much like Harriet Tubman did in Maryland, the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and brought relatives out (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.  Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: Do you know how many trips he made?
Speaker 1: I don't--probably about three, you know, I think there were at least three trips that he made and the reason why obviously, he went all the way up into Canada is because the fugitive slave laws, even though, you know, if you were a slave and you got into the North, in Ohio, which was not a slave state, still you were regarded as a slave based on the fugitive slave laws in those days.  And so--when he reached Canada the expectation was that he was probably gonna stay there because there was no indication once he arrived there--that was his--to start a family there, that they were gonna be free, that the United States were gonna be free.  So back during those days you had the big discussion as to whether or not you know, escaped slaves should stay out of the North American continent or go to Africa, go back to Africa, and so you had that division between the, the slave groups and the leaders (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was he involved in the immigration discussions with Martin Delany and some of the other black people in Chatham [Canada], about going to Africa or Central America, Haiti?
Speaker 1: Well I know the--I have some articles that I found from different, different kinds of research efforts I've made of discussions in Chatham.  I don't know if there were any specific ones in relation to talking directly to Delany, but certainly that was the division between the two.  I think Frederick Douglass was on one side and Delany was on the other in terms of Douglass wanting to stay within the continent.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But the--I found some interesting materials, again through some of my research where there were various committees that were established up in Canada.  Agriculture committee, education committee, farming, well--certainly I mentioned farming, but health committees--in fact, it looked like, you know, kind of a small government was being established there with the idea that African Americans were gonna stay there, slaves--escaped slaves were gonna stay there for a long period of time.
Speaker 2: Well it was extensive.  It was several different communities, Buxton [Canada], Chatham.  What's the place Uncle Tom actually was at--I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well he and Uncle Tom--
Speaker 2: Josiah Henson.
Speaker 1: Henson, yeah Henson, Henson.  It's interesting you mentioned that because Henson and my [maternal] great-grandfather were on several of the same committees together in Canada.
Speaker 2: They called him father Henson.  He was an older man that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and he was the--as you mentioned the--his storyline was the--was a story for Uncle Tom in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.'
Speaker 2: Right, right, so, this is a, so is it--can you give us the name of your ancestor's narrative?  The narrative that he wrote or was written about him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well the--well it was the, you know, the sufferings, the sufferings of Lewis and Milton Clarke, yeah, his brother, sons of a Revolutionary War hero ['Narratives of the Sufferings of Lewis and Milton Clarke, Sons of a Soldier of the Revolution, During a Captivity of More than Twenty Years Among the Slaveholders of Kentucky, One of the So-Called Christian States of North America,' Lewis Clarke and Milton Clarke].
Speaker 2: Okay, the sufferings of Lewis and Milton Clarke.
Speaker 1: Sons of a soldier, soldier of the revolution.
Speaker 2: Sons of soldier?
Speaker 1: Yeah, not, not the--necessarily a hero, but a soldier of the Revolutionary War.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he was your mother's [Virginia Clark Gayton] great (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My mother's grandfather.
Speaker 2: Your mother's grandfather, okay.  Did he return to the continental United States after the Civil War?
Speaker 1: Yes he did.  In fact, when he died, I think it was right around 1889 [sic. 1897] or so, he laid in state at the capitol of Kentucky at that time.  I know they've changed the capitol, but it was the--it was at the rotunda there and the story of his life was in newspapers throughout the country.  In fact, there are teletypes in different parts of the world because of his exploits as an abolitionist.
Story_ID: 484689
Speaker 1: So I have several articles, one in fact it was in Chicago [Illinois], and then I saw an article, I got some old papers that indicate that there was some mention of it in Australia.  And in fact, my [maternal] great-grandfather [Lewis Clarke] was not wealthy when he died.  In fact, there was a gentleman from Australia who sent money to help defray the cost of his funeral in Kentucky.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, maybe--can--I mean--is this some indication of the wide distribution of the book about him at one point?
Speaker 1: Well I think that was part of it, the book and then the--certainly his slave narrative ['Narratives of the Sufferings of Lewis and Milton Clarke, Sons of a Soldier of the Revolution, During a Captivity of More than Twenty Years Among the Slaveholders of Kentucky, One of the So-Called Christian States of North America,' Lewis Clarke and Milton Clarke] was known, but probably, more importantly in terms of popularity was the 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' [Harriet Beecher Stowe] and then the book, 'The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin' [Harriet Beecher Stowe], which, you know, talked about his exploits.
Speaker 2: Okay now, okay now, I don't 'wanna miss something, but the book, 'The Key,' there's a book entitled 'The Key'?
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is a book called 'The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin,' and within that book (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who is that written by?
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it was written by Harriet Beecher Stowe.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so she's explaining--
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's explaining the sources, exactly.
Speaker 2: All right, okay, so this account's first popularity--and that book was wildly popular in the 19th century.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, as the story goes and I may not have the exact words but, when [President] Abraham Lincoln met Harriet Beecher Stowe--he said something to the effect, "So you're the little lady that started this great war?"  Because that was the book that really, you know, got the northern whites in particular, you know, have much more of an understanding and empathy, you know, for the abolitionist movement, and so it was a widely, widely read book.
Speaker 2: It sort of did for the 19th century what television and photographs did for the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 1: That's right, and 'Common Sense' [Thomas Paine] of the Revolutionary War, the pamphlet.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: So, but--no it was a very significant--Tom Paine's book, paper, 'Common Sense.'
Speaker 2: Okay, so it stirred people up and--so that's a great--so when he came back did he come back to--he came back to Kentucky I guess?
Speaker 1: He came back to Kentucky, and as I understand it, he moved around quite a bit, and he had a fairly large family.  One person obviously in that family was my grandfather [Cyrus Clark].  I never met him, he passed away in 1924, but he was born in 1865 in Canada--in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and as the story went, you know, as young guy I really wasn't that interested in family history.  I should've probably asked more questions than I did.  But, one of the things that was pointed out was there was a little bit of concern among the family--within the family particularly the kids, because the father wasn't around that much because he was traveling in different parts of the country, you know, telling about his exploits, and, you know, trying to provide, you know, get support for, you know, African American causes.  And for I guess after my grandfather was born, you know, but that interest in that story was still there so there was still popular interest in what he did in the 1840s and the 1850s prior to the Civil War.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what part of Kentucky--did he come back to the same part of Kentucky where he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As I recall he went back to Campbell [Campbell County, Kentucky]--he ultimately was buried in Oberlin--his gravesite is in Oberlin, Ohio.  In fact, it was in fallow for a long time, and no one really knew where the gravesite was so I think it was in the late '60s [1960s] that the son of one of Lewis Clarke's daughters was able to find out where that gravesite was, and he was living in Columbus, Ohio, and so he was able to identify that gravesite in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].  In fact, he came out, my mother [Virginia Clark Gayton] knew of him as the son of her aunt, I guess it would've been, and so there was kind of reunion of the families back in the early 1970s and a celebration of the life of Lewis Clarke, because we had not seen this slave narrative.  We knew--we had a copy of 'The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin.'  It's one of those books that's been in the family for so long, and no one is quite sure, you know, exactly where that, that where that book is.  But, someone in the family has it.  I'll have to find it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's a book that's probably still available in the library archives all over the country (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  No question about it.
Speaker 2: And, you know, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' is still being taught in the classroom all over the United States?
Speaker 1: In fact sometimes you look on The History Channel [History] and there's a, you know, there's a--I'm trying to think of the other channel where they do talk about history books, and maybe it is The History Channel.  But, I've witnessed a few accounts when they talk about Harriet Beecher Stowe, invariably Lewis Clarke's name comes up in those discussions.
Story_ID: 484690
Speaker 1: So your mother [Virginia Clark Gayton] now--did your mother have any reflections about Lewis Clarke?
Speaker 2: Nothing other than the fact that, you know, he's almost a mythical figure, and kind of a--what would you call it?--I think he was just kind of a naturally bright guy.  He wasn't schooled, but he was--he had this innate intelligence that had a quick, you know, sense of humor, and kind of was his, you know, marched to his own drumbeat.  I don't think he probably paid as much attention as my grandfather would've liked in terms of the family because of his popularity and interest that people had in him.  But, but, he was, you know, regarded, as a kind man, and that, you know, he made a wonderful, a great contribution to the downfall of slavery.
Speaker 1: Now what did your grandfather do--your mother's father was he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he was--
Speaker 1: And what was his name, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: His name was Cyrus Clark.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was born in Windsor, Ontario [Canada] as I mentioned.  But, he came back for one reason or another and I don't know all the connections, he ended up in Tennessee, was a school teacher, had been--and he met my mother's mother there in Nashville [Tennessee].  But they ultimately married in Spokane, Washington.  And he--I think it related to his being on the railroad, I mean he was a porter on the railroads.  He--you know, coming north--and it's the same thing with my grandmother, her name was Guela Clark, G-U-E-L-A, Guela Johnson Clark, and she was a school teacher too, but, you know, even though they could work as teachers down in, you know, teach at the black schools in Nashville, when they came north, I think it was because of my grandfather's work, they couldn't get work in the North because of their race.  But, he was on the railroads for, you know, a number of years until he was, you know, became too ill to continue on.  And my mother after she went through--all the way through school, you know, grade school, and high school in Spokane she went on to--the family moved on to--I think for financial reasons Vancouver, British Columbia [Canada], and to go back to his, you know, his original homeland which was not Windsor, Ontario, but Vancouver, and so they were living there in the 1920s.
Story_ID: 484691
Speaker 1: But in the meantime, my mother [Virginia Clark Gayton]--after she graduated from high school, Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane [Washington], she went up to Canada, and from there she went back to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now this is ironic, just to--just as you mentioned that she attends Lewis and Clark High School.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And her grandfather's name is--
Speaker 1: Is Lewis Clarke.  Exactly.
Speaker 2: So this is, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah that was regarded as the--there weren't that many blacks in Spokane over the years, but that was regarded as a school that if blacks went to school they tended to go to Lewis and Clark.
Speaker 2: I think that's where [HistoryMaker] Mona Lake Jones went?
Speaker 1: That's right, Mona Lake Jones went there.  I think her mother [Pauline Sims Lake] and father [Sylvester Lake]--but she--it's interesting, another twist with regard to this whole situation, she went back to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] on the railroad from Vancouver, British Columbia [Canada], my mother--after graduating from Lewis and Clark, and the family moved up to Vancouver, and she back to live with her uncle whose name was Henry Baker [Henry E. Baker].  And if you look at the history books, Henry Baker was a patent attorney, and had one of those--probably the first and most extensive research on black inventors, and there's a publication that goes--I think it may of come out about 1900.  All these, you know, black inventors, you know, during the 19th century, a very widely acclaimed--in fact he was named--I think in the 1920s, early 1920s as one of the hundred most prominent blacks in America.  But, he--she stayed at her uncle's place with--the uncle married my grandfather Cyrus Clark's sister, and she's also a daughter of Lewis Clarke.  And very interesting family, they're very, you know, part of the black intelligentsia, and she had done work with--on a project with--gosh I'm trying to think of the (laughter) the founder of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], yeah, W.E.B. Du Bois, she was working on some projects as it related to--especially as related to, you know, prominent black women of the 19th century, and so I saw some--looking at some works in the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] where she worked on some committees, you know, with W.E.B Du Bois.
Speaker 2: So, what was her name, Baker right, last name was Baker?
Speaker 1: I think her name was Letitia, Letitia Baker [ph.], and she died at a young age in Washington, D.C. but, my mother really enjoyed that experience back there.  It--at Howard here--she went--like going to Mars, going on a train, all the way from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Howard University, and she was treated--she said--she always talked about she was treated like a little princess because all the black porters and waiters knew each other, and they knew that, you know, my grandfather's daughter was going back there so she was--everybody treated her so, so well, in that trip all the way back to Washington, D.C.  But she stayed there for three years, and had to come back because of illness and her mother [Guela Johnson Clark] and father were getting--and particularly her father and so she had to come back.  Well the other thing too was that Mrs. Baker passed away, and so it was kind of an awkward situation for her to, you know, to stay back there because the Bakers were taking care of her tuition at Howard at the time.  But, he's a very prominent figure in the, you know, the early part of the 20th century.
Speaker 2: Henry Baker?
Speaker 1: Henry Baker.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so your mother--she grew up fairly well under the circumstances I guess?
Speaker 1: Well, it's--you know, it's--well she--it certainly was middle class, and the well to do related to her educationally background, and, you know, my mother, you know, having gone to Howard and so on, and then she didn't--her family--immediate family didn't have the money for her to go through Howard.  But Mr. Baker did, and he was fairly well to do, and certainly his wife Letitia--she was a li- you know, she was a librarian, you know, back there at the Library of Congress.  In fact, I found some papers--my daughter [Cynthia Gayton] she's an attorney back in D.C., and we went together, it was fun looking up these files at the Library of Congress, and we were able to find where my mother worked as a, you know, a clerk, in between school years at the Library of Congress with her aunt.  Her aunt was a--like I said was a librarian there, and--but, educationally they were well to do.  But, you know, certainly economically the family, my mother's immediate family wasn't that wealthy, but they had, you know, good educational backgrounds.
Story_ID: 484692
Speaker 1: Well let me ask about your father's side of the family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you list your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is John Jacob Gayton [John J. Gayton].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth, and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He's born December 27th, 1899.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay, in Seattle.
Story_ID: 484693
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so we were talking about off camera--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the relationship between your family and the family of Hiram--
Speaker 2: Revels [Hiram Rhodes Revels], right.
Speaker 1: Revels, that the Caytons and the Woodsons--well the Caytons, yeah, Caytons and the Revels yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So Susie Revels Cayton, Horace Cayton's [Horace R. Cayton, Sr.]--?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite sure if that was his wife or his daughter.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: But if I recall, there was a daughter of Horace Cayton and his wife, was close to my mother [Virginia Clark Gayton] and father [John J. Gayton].  In fact, I have a letter, I was just reading it a couple of weeks ago.  Susan--Susie Revels Cayton wrote to my mother saying she was gonna be in play.  Langston Hughes asked her to be in a play 'cause you know, he was moving around different places trying to, you know make a living and then he had this wonderful musical, it's in his autobiography, I can't remember the name of it and she said she was flattered that Langston Hughes in this letter she wrote to my mother, she was flattered (laughter) that Langston Hughes wanted her, you know, to be in that play, but she said didn't--that wasn't her interest to move in that direction.  But she was back there talking to Horace Cayton, Jr. [Horace R. Cayton, Jr.] with her brother.  Horace Cayton, Jr., who was very prominent in his own right.
Speaker 1: Sociologist?
Speaker 2: Sociologist, yeah, and he wrote the 'Long Old Road' ['Long Old Road: An Autobiography,' Horace R. Cayton, Jr.], and he wrote that--the 'Black Metropolis' ['Black Metropolis: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern City,' St. Clair Drake and Horace R. Cayton, Jr.], co-wrote that with St. Clair (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) With St. Clair Drake, right.
Speaker 2: St. Clair, yeah St. Clair Drake.  And so Horace Cayton, Jr. and my father were basically the same age, who grew up together and played together.  In fact, in Horace Cayton, Jr.'s book 'Long Old Road,' there's an account of a--you know, of a picnic, you know, wonderful picnic that they had over--my grandfather had out in the country, which is only a matter of a couple of blocks away (laughter) a farm over there and so the black kids in the community would go together, you know, to the--my grandfather's farm, and, and this is--that's J.T. Gayton, John Thomas Gayton, Sr. [John T. Gayton].
Speaker 1: I have to apologize, whoever is watching this video in the future who wonders why I can't make the--all the right connections here, but that is the connection.  If you look at Susan Woodson's [HistoryMaker Susan Cayton Woodson] interview with The HistoryMakers, and the first part when she describes her family, and then somebody watches what you just described, they could put all that history together.
Speaker 2: Oh isn't that something, yeah.
Speaker 1: But then they can put it all together.  But, you know, I just can't remember all of it to be able to admit it myself right now but that's how you do it.
Speaker 2: Well, it's such a small world when you start talking about the so called black intelligentsia or what Langston Hughes called the Negro elite, he didn't say Negro (laughter).  But you know, it is a small world particularly going back in those early years in the 1900, you know, the Talented Tenth kind of thing, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.  Well, Susan Woodson I think is still alive in Chicago [Illinois], has a gallery.  She was active in the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] arts projects, and the creation of the South Side Community Art Center [Chicago, Illinois], and sponsored a lot of the artist, and she runs a gallery out of her home in Hyde Park, in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: She--I'm sure she worked with Hor- 'cause Horace Cayton had a, you know, kind of a center, community center, one of the first of its kind in the country as I understand, that he was running back there, and I think while he was still, you know, teaching at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: That's right, I can't think of the exact name of it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, anybody watching this can go refer back to the other one.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And put it together 'cause it was an interesting history.  Paul Robeson.  There's an activist history, there's an arts history here.  So migration, migration history that goes all over the place.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: From Kentucky, to Mississippi, to Vancouver [Canada], you know.
Speaker 2: Well, as I recall in the 'Long Old Road,' Horace Cayton, Jr., you know, talks about them meeting up here in Seattle [Washington].  Booker T. Washington, and Horace Cayton, Sr., and Hiram Revels may have been up here himself, you know, but, but, you know, just, you know, talking about the issues of the day.  And the thing is there's a--Horace Cayton was reflected in our exhibit, and the thing is the newspaper he had, had the largest--second largest circulation of any newspaper black or white in the Seattle area in the late 1800s.  The Republican [Seattle Republican].
Speaker 1: Okay, the Republican, that's right.
Speaker 2: Right, right, and so--I mean that was--Horace Cayton and his wife, regarded as a pretty, pretty elite, you know, family, couple here in Seattle back in those days, because they, they represented the best of what, you know, African American intelligentsia is, you know, is all about, and anywhere in the country really, if you stop and think about it.
Story_ID: 484694
Speaker 1: Now we were starting to talk about your father John Jacob Gayton [John J. Gayton] before we changed tape (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --so let's cover him, we got his date of birth, and place of birth, and born here in Seattle [Washington].  What do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well, my father's side--my, my grandfather--it really begins with my grandfather, J.T. Gayton, John Thomas Gayton [John T. Gayton], and he came up here about 1888, a year before we became a state, and he was probably about twenty years old.  He was born about 1860, about 1866 in Yazoo County [Mississippi], in Benton, Mississippi, which is basically farmland, not a plantation there and it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, you said Yazoo County, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and his father was a sharecropper, and I think when he reached about the age of eighteen, and I don't know if his mother died or what, but anyway there's certainly was a separation between his father, and his mother, and so he kind of--he left the family when--I have the marriage records of J.T.'s father, you know, you know, remarrying right about 1875 or so, and--so I think there was a, you know, he was eighteen years of age, and I don't know if the new marriage was, you know, that compatible with everybody in the family at that time, but he decided to kind of go off on his own, and started working for a physician in Yazoo City [Mississippi], and became the footman, or the--basically the valet for this physician, and, you know, 1888, he was the driver, you know, I guess a carriage driver or whatever, came out to Seattle, and that gentleman, I think his name was Yarno [ph.] as I recall, he became the first county coroner, King County [Washington] coroner.
Speaker 1: His name was Yarno?
Speaker 2: I think it was Yarno.
Speaker 1: Yarno okay.  Y-A-R-N-O?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's reflected in that account that you have in historylink.org, but--so he did a variety of things when he arrived here in Seattle.  He was a painter, and cut hair, and he did a wide variety--very ambitious young man, and was one of the--became one of the founders of the first African American church here in the State of Washington--the First A.M.E. Church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Seattle, Washington], and was on the board when the, the current building that we're in was built.  So, my brother Gary [HistoryMaker Gary Gayton] has passed on, you know, some of this information about him.  But, he may even have more detail on--but, he also became the, the head steward, you know, for the Rainier Club [Seattle, Washington], which is the elite social club downtown and--which is still in operation, and still regarded as an, as an elite club.  And--so he did that for a number of years, and then, you know, went to business college on his own.  Really didn't have a great a deal of formal education, and didn't talk--there wasn't that much information about the family that my dad passed on to me, in--back in Mississippi.  But, I was able to find the 1870 census, and find that he had a lot of, you know, several, you know, probably at least about six, you know, brothers, and sisters, and--but, there's not that much discussion or talk about them.  So there's not a great deal of history.  But, I know he wanted to get out of there, because that was about the time of the black codes, you know, the rise of the Ku Klux Klan [KKK], and the white--National Knights committee, and all that sort of business.  So it was a place he wanted to be away from--and I don't recall him--but, he was much older than me, so I don't remember any real conversation 'cause I was about--what was I?  Probably about eight, nine years old when he passed away.
Story_ID: 484695
Speaker 1: Didn't have that much, you know, that much knowledge of his family.  But, there was, you know, I found out one thing though that, you know, I think that most people realize about slavery is that, you know, every attempt was made, you know, to make sure that one's history, and one's family--if there's any connection with Africa, whatever, was wiped out because they, that was one way, they made control--maintained control over the slaves.  But, there was one name among his brothers and sisters, called Litho [Litho Gayton], he had a sister named Mary [Mary Gayton], a brother named Tom [ph.], and you know, down the line, you know, traditional Anglo names.  But, one named Litho, L-I-T-H-O, and I found out subsequently, you know, where--if that would--I saw--if that was an African derivative name, and it came to mind when I saw a Time magazine article about 1980 that had the picture of General Litho [Mboti Litho] on it from Zaire [Democratic Republic of the Congo], from the Congo and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How, do you spell that?
Speaker 1: L-I-T-H-O.
Speaker 2: L-I-T-H-O, Litho?
Speaker 1: Litho, and most, you know, all the other siblings had, you know, traditional, you know, American or, Anglo names.
Speaker 2: So, you think it was a conscious attempt to remember an ancestral name?
Speaker 1: That's right, that's what I--that's my supposition, but I'm still working on that, been working on that for twenty years.  But, I found out in talking to some of--'cause I was teaching down at Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida].  A graduate school down there, and I talked to one of my Nigerian friends, and I said, "Is this a general name?"  You know, like Swahili is kind of a general language, you know, of West Africa?  He said, "No."  He said, "But we have some friends that are from the Congo.  They're from Zaire, you might want to talk to them," so I was introduced to these folks, and they said, I got all this information.  They said that Litho was one of the larger family names in the Congo, and told you know, the tribe, and the region it's from, and what tributary, you know, on the Congo River is from.  So, they started to call me, you know, my brother, all this sort of business and so, that's about as far as I've gotten.  But, I want to find out more, about that name, and I know that my grandfather's [John T. Gayton] father's father, he came from a foreign country which is obviously Africa, so I'm still working on, you know, connecting the dots between the Congo and possibly Yazoo County, Mississippi.
Story_ID: 484696
Speaker 1: But anyway, my [paternal] grandfather [John T. Gayton] was--came up here, worked on his own, you know, worked at the Rainier Club [Seattle, Washington] as a steward, became a bailiff, and then worked his way up through the court system, and he ultimately became a federal district court for western Washington [U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington] librarian.
Speaker 2: He became what, sorry?
Speaker 1: A federal district court librarian, and it was all based on his, you know, on his work, you know, studying on his own at, at business college, and he had worked for every federal district court judge all the way--you know, the State of Washington ever had in western--in the western region, all the way up 'til he died, and he stayed, you know, working for them until he was about nineteen.  He had a special dispensation age wise, and he worked 'til he was about eighty years old, and I had lawyers coming up to me--old time lawyers coming up to me, and says--they would say things like, "Well I--when I was a young lawyer, I knew your grandfather, and I could just mention a particular case," and they said he--that he really helped him out, and they would--and then he would--my grandfather would--they'd mention a case, and he knew directly where to go get the law book 'cause he had this unbelievable memory, you know, about these law books, and so there were a number of lawyers back in--particularly in the--remember there's a--member of the board of University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] told me several stories like that, and others did too, about my grandfather and his relationship with the legal community.  And I think it was my grandfather that got my brother Gary [HistoryMaker Gary Gayton] interested in going into law school.  But, now days you can't become a court librarian, federal, federal court or otherwise without having a law degree nowadays as I understand.  But, he was, was a pretty unique man.  A very highly respected in the community.  He rose up within the ranks of the First A.M.E. Church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Seattle, Washington] as an officer--was treasurer for them, was an officer within the Republican--the black Republican Party, and that was the--back in those days in the early 1900s on into the '30s [1930s] before Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] came into the picture.  That was regarded as the party of Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln], and the, you know, the progressive party.  At least as it related to the interest of black folks, and so he's a very active Republican.  But, even, even after Roosevelt came (laughter), he continued as a strong, strong Republican.  That wasn't unusual for a gentlemen his age, in blacks.
Speaker 2: So, he was good friend of Horace Cayton, Sr. [Horace R. Cayton, Sr.]?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: And Horace Cayton's paper was called the Republican.
Speaker 1: That's right, that right and, you know, I have a book that was published in 1927 of African American families and individuals, you know, throughout the Northwest and not only Washington, but, you know, but Oregon and British Columbia [Canada] and so on and so forth and all of them listed their party in the--you know, we're talking about late 1920s.  Their political party is Republican.  All of them were Masons.  And I don't--that's something I have to research a little bit further, I don't know what--but the Masons--being part of the Masons was really an important aspect of their social lives (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah ev-
Story_ID: 484697
Speaker 1: When you were talking about the first part of--during the first part of the interview, you were talking about your mother [Virginia Clark Gayton] escaped to Canada.  Masons played a big role in ferrying escaped slaves across to Canada (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: There was actually a group from Detroit [Michigan] called the Order of the Men of Oppression, (unclear), that operated for many years, William Lambert and George DeBaptiste.
Speaker 2: George DeBaptiste, yeah, okay.  Yeah, I know my dad [John J. Gayton] used to--I don't think my dad was involved, but he would talk about the Masons, but it was interesting in that particular book that my grandfather [John T. Gayton] provided to us and I have a copy of that, that was the Masons and the Republicans, I mean of the--and the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, those were all the--those were the three major community organizations they were involved in--community social organizations.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's the basis of my grandfather's side, and then there were--he married a lady named Magnolia Scott [Magnolia Scott Gayton].  She was from Mississippi also, but married her up here, and she was a mulatto, and they had--my dad was the oldest child, born 1890, and as I mentioned and then my Uncle Jim, Jim Gayton [James Gayton], Leonard Gayton and then Louise, and Louise Gayton [Louise Gayton Phelps].  And Louise, just to show these connections because you probably--I'm sure you would be interviewing him if he were alive, and that's Donald Phelps, she married Phelps--I think his name may have been Donald also, and had three children.  The oldest of whom was Donald Gayton Phelps, who ultimately became the chancellor of the Los Angeles community college system [Los Angeles Community College District], was chancellor of the Seattle community college system [Seattle Community Colleges District; Seattle Colleges District], and then became a, a full professor at University of Texas in Austin [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] and passed away about three or four years ago.  But, he was, he was part of that, that was Louise's, that was J.T.'s daughter, my father's sister, and so--and then ultimately, you know, with the Gaytons, my grandfather was the true patriarch of the family.  I mean he would set up his home down there, on 26th [Avenue] and right off of Madison [Street].  They had the farm over across the, the waters, and he'd wear, you know, his gold chain, and his spats I remember seeing him in his spats in those--what do they call those?
Speaker 1: Monocles?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, you just hang it on your nose.
Speaker 1: Yeah it's a monocle, no, no, not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pierce--
Speaker 1: Nez Perce--no, not.  Pince-nez.
Speaker 2: Pince-nez.
Speaker 1: And the Nez Perce are Indians [Native American]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he would wear that with a big cord hanging down.
Speaker 1: Thank you Scott Stearns--the videographer here is a scholar as well.  Pince-nez.
Speaker 2: Okay, (laughter) and he would, I mean he did the unbelievable stuff, I mean he would--every Friday, all of his buddies would smoke cigars, drink scotch and play poker and, you know, just regale--he was the raconteur.  My brother Gary [HistoryMaker Gary Gayton] got a lot of that from him and he (laughter), unbelievable.
Story_ID: 484698
Speaker 1: Man, and then there's Homer Harris, his picture is out there.  I don't know if you were--I don't know if you were able to interview him, he just passed away about five years ago, but he was just a living legend, I mean he was a--one of the greatest athletes to come out of this part of the country and probably one of the most prominent dermatologist in the country, and studied under the great dermatologist [Theodore K. Lawless] in Chicago [Illinois], there was an African American dermatologist, Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], both of 'em connections, had connection with Meharry.  But he lived right--his family lived right near my [paternal] grandfather's [John T. Gayton] family and he would regale to me with stories and you're talking about these years, how they collapsed, I mean he died at ninety, he was talking about when he was a kid and my grandfather would run him off his, front porch, "Get your narrow B ass outta here," and (laughter) he would tell me all this--great that you have editors and all that sort of stuff.  But, anyway he would regale me with these unbelievable stories he was a--Homer Harris was a guy, you know, you talk about, you know, scholar athletes and, you know, their role and this guy was a brilliant student and a great athlete, and just a great model for young people.
Speaker 2: Homer Harris?
Speaker 1: Homer Harris, yeah, he's one that you should posthumously, you know, check him out because he's a real legend here in this part of the country.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway there was a whole community down there in the valley, the Madison Valley [Seattle, Washington] (background noise)--marched to his own drumbeat, didn't get involved into to many social organizations or social actions groups, but just by his--just by what he did in his professional life, what he did in his athletic life and what he did in his personal life, you know, it was--he just, you know, excelled in all those levels, but did not get into the traditional, you know, community kinds of activities, wasn't a--you know, didn't carry any billboard cards or anything of that sort to demonstrate any one way or the other, he just, he just excelled in what he did, in his academically and athletically and professionally and you know, that told everything and he was our local kind of Paul Robeson, you know, without the social activism.
Story_ID: 484699
Speaker 1: What did your father [John J. Gayton] tell you about growing up?  What were some of his stories?
Speaker 2: About growing up here?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, with eight kids in the family, and I was toward the end.  I didn't have a great many, you know, conversations with him.  It almost--you know, had to get a ticket, you know, to get, (laughter) to get an audience or whatever.  And the dinner table was really something, if you, you know, if you didn't talk loud and fast and have a strong point, you know, you know, you weren't heard, but--
Speaker 1: You were the baby of the family?
Speaker 2: I was toward the end, yeah I was sixth.  I was sixth.
Speaker 1: Sixth out of eight?
Speaker 2: Sixth out of eight and, and you know I just kind of regaled in those times when it would just be me, you know, with him and he'd take me over to the--I just vaguely remember going over to the old family farm, over in Hazelwood, Washington.  I mean, now it's all part of that big growth of Bellevue [Washington], I mean--they held onto that farm, my grandfather [John T. Gayton] held onto that thing for fifty years and sold it about, you know, two years before the big boom over there across the lake, over in Bellevue, Washington, but I, you know, he would take me, over--you know, I'd remember those times going over there and he'd talk about these wonderful times over there and then I'd, you know, like I said, it was such a long time ago, that I just had these kind of glimpses of memory of them.  But those--I know those were wonderful times for him and he said they lived over there for a period of time because my grandfather--my grandmother [Magnolia Scott Gayton] was sickly and he would take--he would go from across the lake, Lake Washington and, you know, take a boat from there over to Franklin High School [Seattle, Washington], which is only a matter, oh about three or four blocks from here and so there are no schools over there, I mean it's huge, I mean it's a huge metropolis over there now.  But he would talk about those stories then he'd talk about going by horseback up to Black Diamond [Washington] and work in the coal mines, which is east of where he lived in Hazelwood, and, you know, in fact, he may have had this to spend his last year at school as I recall, you know, working, you know, to bring in, you know, support for the family and all that sort of business in high school, but Black Diamond, that was back when coal was, was big and so there were a lot of blacks and Italians, you know, that worked.  In fact this school was predominant Italian back in those days, the early 1900s and on into the '20s [1920s].  They called it Garlic Gulch.  But the Italians and the blacks would work in those coal mines and there's a place called Roslyn, Washington which was further up into the Cascades [Cascade Range] up at Snoqualmie Pass, in that area, where they recruited blacks and in the middle of nowhere, they had this fairly large black community relatively speaking in the middle of those mountains up there.  And not too far from there was this Black Diamond, but they did recruit actively blacks, you know, worked in the coal mines in this area, two of which were--Roslyn and the other one was Black Diamond, my dad worked in those, but he would talk about that.   And he was--he helped out my grandfather and I didn't do it toward--'til the end, but the connections to my grandfather had with the Rainier Club [Seattle, Washington].  Sometimes they would kind of--they had their little family thing together where they would be the bartenders for, you know, for these very special parties for the well to do in Seattle [Washington] and Fisher Island [Washington] and over at Bellevue, The Highlands [Shoreline, Washington] and down at the Tennis Club [Seattle Tennis Club, Seattle, Washington] which were all these elite places, so he would bring his sons together and then ultimately--my dad would bring Gary [HistoryMaker Gary Gayton] and my older brothers Phil [Philip Gayton] and John [John C. Gayton], they would do the same thing, so that was the way they made a little bit of extra money as kids and I think I may have done it once, as I recall one time, but he started doing that when my grandfather, you know, my grandfather, you know, worked, yeah even when there was a librarian and a bailiff even, you know, and looking at different ways in which to bring in money into the family.  And one of the things that he always talked about that my grandfather did, is that even during the Depression [Great Depression], even though they had a large family they never had to go on the dole, and so that was always a statement of pride, that they didn't--I mean there was nothing wrong, you know, with people going, you know, on welfare.  But they were proud of the fact that they were able to sustain themselves economically by working all these various jobs, and not have to go on welfare, which was very unique, you know, for black families during those Depression years.
Story_ID: 484700
Speaker 1: Where did your dad [John J. Gayton] go to school?  Did he get a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: No he didn't go to college but I--he went to Franklin High School [Seattle, Washington].  I'm pretty sure he graduated from there, but he was a really innately bright gentlemen, and read a lot, all the--in fact, I'd get all these publications, you know, about some of the civil rights leaders and some of the folks that he, you know, admired, like A. Philip Randolph, you know, you know for example, you know, he would--Marcus Garvey--I mean he would have all these--I remember we'd get these little comic books with all these black heroes, and he'd bring those in, and just, some of these little pamphlets and stuff and then they had a lot of books, they had a lot of books, I guess both my gra- my dad's as well as my mother's [Virginia Clark Gayton] going back into, you know, the 1800s about, you know, the great leaders during the 1800s, these old books and I don't know--must be distributed throughout (laughter) my older brothers and sisters because I haven't seen 'em here lately.  But we would--I'd get a kick out of looking at those books, but my dad was well read, kept up with the news, politics, was a strong Democrat.  Got very active in--those kinds of political activities that some people may have thought would, you know, but not at the time, but you know, bordered on, you know, kind of, you know, socialistic or even more to the left than that.  But most of the guys of his generation were very active in those kinds of things back in those days and I'll never forget (laughter) when I didn't know about all of the--his activities, but there wasn't anything that--he wasn't arrested for anything, but I was the first black to be brought into the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] in the State of Washington and my dad never told me until after I left the bureau, he said that he'd (laughter) that I might not get in because of the background checks they may have done on my dad.
Story_ID: 484701
Speaker 1: Can you tell us how your parents [Virginia Clark Gayton and John J. Gayton] met?
Speaker 2: They met right about 19--I guess it was about 1926, and my mother was living in Vancouver, British Columbia [Canada], and the work situation up there was getting a little bit tight, and so what she decided to was to come to Seattle [Washington] and--to get, you know, to get work and then the idea was to, you know, help out the family sending money back to Vancouver, and so, I forget exactly what job she worked in, but she stayed at the Phyllis Wheatley YWCA [Seattle, Washington], which is right off about 22nd [Avenue] and Madison [Street] and so that was right in the middle of the African American community in Seattle.  My dad, you know, didn't live too far from the Phyllis Wheatley Y.  In fact, that was on 22nd, my dad lived on twenty--with my grandfather [John T. Gayton] on 26th [Avenue] off of Madison, you know down there.  And so, anyway, they lived--so I'm sure with the social things that were going on with the young folks at that time that they, come together for different kinds of dances and social events and picnics.  And my mother, she was active in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church in Spokane [Washington] as a child, you know, growing up and so I'm sure she even went to the First A.M.E. Church [First African Methodist Episcopal Church, Seattle, Washington] and so there are several ways in which they I'm sure they could've met and did meet, and so that started the, really, you know, started the romance between the two of 'em.  Just--I think just from the different activities for, you know, young folks at that time.  So they were both in their early--my dad middle twenties, mother early twenties.
Speaker 1: Now they--but they don't have a story, they don't tell a story about how--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, there was no particular story that I can recall, that, that resonates with me at this point.  But, I know that my dad he was a very good dancer, you know, nice looking kind of bon vivant.  Not at the level that my grandfather was probably.  But, I think my mother was probably, you know, swept off her feet maybe because of his personality, and the fact that he was a, you know, he liked to enjoy himself.  He was a good dancer, and he was a wonderful singer.
Story_ID: 484702
Speaker 1: My dad [John J. Gayton] had a wonderful singing voice.  In fact, one of the stories that he tells, or would tell us back in the--up until the day he died, he said that he had an offer to be provided a scholarship to study voice in London, England, and you know, he was so smitten by my mother [Virginia Clark Gayton], you know, when they met and he was going to the Cornish school for the arts [Cornish School of Music; Cornish College of the Arts] here in Seattle [Washington], which is still operating, and studying--and so his voice, you know, a wonderful tenor voice, and he said, "I gave that all up, you know, for your mother," and I have no regrets, he said, "I have no regrets."  But, he would say that so often, you often wondered (laughter).  He'd say, "I have no regrets to about giving that up."
Speaker 2: Now, now, so he, he came out of--you said high school--he had a high school degree but, he--and he's attending the Cornish School?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Cornish it was an arts--it was arts school so he, he did do--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that is some kind of college--
Speaker 1: Yes, no question, no question about it.  Yeah, my, my cousin Don Phelps [Donald Gayton Phelps] and I mentioned--he had a wonderful singing voice too, and sang with different--with the Pennsylvanians or the--what was his--Fred Wagner as I recall.  What's that, Wagner?
Speaker 2: It's not Wagner, it's Fred--I know who it is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that was--but he sang with that choir which was a real, real popular in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Waring.
Speaker 1: Fred Waring, exactly.  Pennsylvanians, exactly.  He sang with them, but he was, you know my dad was his idol.  Because my dad was such a wonderful singer.  But, my--the regret that I have--there's no recordings of his voice that I have, that I'm knowledgeable of.  But, he had--we could--but music was so much a part of our family, and it was his singing, and my sisters would accompany him, you know, I'd wake up--the thing, they'd wake us up in the morning--wasn't alarm clocks or anything like that, it was my dad, you know, singing the scales with my sisters accompanying him early in the morning, you know before we went to school.
Speaker 2: So they were--he was studying classical music?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, in fact it was--I'm trying to think of the gentleman's name, the wonderful black tenor.
Speaker 2: Roland Hayes?
Speaker 1: Roland Hayes, exactly, Roland Hayes was his idol.  In fact, I think he, I think he had met him a couple times, and by--I think he encouraged him.  Roland Hayes, exactly was his idol.
Speaker 2: That's something.  Okay, we got a lot of history on this.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah that's right, Roland--and we've got a lot of his records--Roland Hayes--and so--and he was like Roland Hayes in that, you know, if you look at an old Roland Hayes album, he would have, you know, kind of that classical kind of Wagnerian, you know, songs on one side of the album, and the other side would be spirituals, and so my dad--the wonderful spirituals he would sing, those were moving (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now you said--
Speaker 1: --very moving.
Story_ID: 484703
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Virginia Clark Gayton and John J. Gayton] personalities, their gifts and talents, and their dispositions, who do you think that you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Gosh, well I think I'm kind of a, you know, a mix of the both of them.  My dad, you know, he was a very, you know he wasn't a shy man, but he was not boisterous, you know, at all.  He was a determined man, I mean he--that's one thing that I try to instill in my son, I mean it's not always the intelligence you have, it's how, how hard you work at it and being focused on what you, you want to do.  And my dad was a, you know, very committed and determined, and his, his, commitment, determination aided the family with, you know, raising eight kids.  Most of whom were born during the Depression [Great Depression].  You could imagine what it took, to you know, stay off of welfare and be able to get food on the table, but my mother was--I was close--very close to her.  She was, she was interesting in that she, was hard-nosed, you know raising--you had to be hard-nosed raising kids.  But, interesting thing about her is that I never saw--I only saw her cry twice all during those years, and the first time was, was when my grandmother [Guela Johnson Clark] died, she was a wonderful lady.  A very kind person, a black lady, but, you know had, you know I got a big lock of her hair, you know, she had blondish red hair.  She had these really, you know, blue deep--really, you know, kind of white, blue eyes.  Didn't look black at all, but she was, you know, she was a race woman.  I mean she--there were a lot of people like that, and she was just a wonderful kind lady, and I remember her vividly, and I would go up to her house, and stay overnight and stuff, and she, you know she'd babysit me and all that sort of stuff.  But, she was--and then she'd always, you know, I'd always, you know, she wanted me to brush her hair, her hair she'd worn it in a bun, and, you know with a little ivory, you know, kind of comb on top that she would--but at night she would take it out, and I remember, you know, those days you're brushing her hair, it come all the way down to her, to her buttocks.  But, just a wonderful kind lady, and very bright.  So I was very close to her, and my mother I'll never forget after my grandmother passed away, you know, she seemed a lot older than she was, but, my--it really hit my mother and she cried for a week, and I remember crying with her, you know, here I was, I was probably about eight years old, but I remember so much, you know, about her.  I was close to my, close to my mother, I would have--people--when the family said that was I probably spoiled, more spoiled than any of the others in the family because there was four years between my next older brother, and four years for my younger brother so there was more time that she spent with me, than any of em--any of the others, and she was, you know, she'd take me on special trips to, you know, we have the Puyallup State Fair [Washington State Fair], and she would just take me, and the, you know, on a Greyhound bus to those things my grandmother would do the same thing, take me down to the Kresges [S.S. Kresge Company] store to get a milkshake.  But just that, you know, it was, it was such a treasure to spend time with my mother growing up, as well as my grandmother.  They were--and my mother always--she had to be a tough disciplinarian to raise eight kids.  I'll never forget she--'cause my mother had a, you know, a nervous breakdown.
Story_ID: 484704
Speaker 1: After, you know, almost she [Gayton's mother, Virginia Clark Gayton] timed it right before the last child had come out of high school, and during that time she would always say, you know, you think when she's, you know, looking back on her life--I guess she said, you think you'll ever be as nice and kind as grandma [Guela Johnson Clark]?  And the irony of that was that she ultimately--and she was exactly like, exactly like her, toward the end of her life, and she always had that worry, you know, whether or not she'd be like that, and she was exactly like her.  But she--there was nobody than her growing up, the disciplinarian was my--well it was her really, and my dad [John J. Gayton]--I'll forget, the stories of--if I had done something, my mother would say, well make sure--you know, after she'd had done the switch on me, we had our own (laughter) lilac tree in the backyard, and she'd go back whenever she wanted--she said, "Go get the switch," you know, so we'd take a switch of the--and then you had to--you know, so now, okay now give it to me, and then she started the switch thing, and but, that tree looked so raggedy, I mean because it would take--over the years we were taking off (laughter), you know, switches.  But, then when the--then I'd come home, and my dad would say--or my mother would say, "Wait 'til your father comes home, he's gonna get--," so my father would come home after work--three, four jobs, and he worked a lot--he--I mean he wore himself out, I mean just worked himself to death literally I think, and said--he'd come home and say, "If I were ten years younger, you know, you'd really get it, you know, you'd really get it," but, the older ones, you know got the worst of it (laughter) 'cause when I came along, you know, he really was worn out so I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So he was ten years younger?
Speaker 1: Yeah, (laughter) exactly, but so I never, I never did get it tough from, you know, from my dad.  But, he was a---the things I remember about him are just those, you those unique moments, you know, when he's carrying me, and those unique times right around the holidays, when he'd always wait with all these jobs he had, and he would always wait to the last, you know, 'til noon--or to Christmas Eve to paint the calcimine.  I don't know if you've ever heard of calcimine, it's a paint, and it smelled, you know, it smelled like gasoline, and it was very watery, and so, he would paint, you know, start painting the whole house, and then I remember distinctly the smell of calcimine, and the Christmas tree, you know, that--the mingling of those two smells.  I always think of Christmas, and he'd always--and the times we'd go out Christmas Eve, he and I to get the Christmas tree and we'd go to Chubby and Tubby [Seattle, Washington] or, you know someplace where--and he'd, you know, the tree looked like something out of Peanuts, you know, every time.  (Laughter) You know, he, he couldn't believe it, he'd say, look what I got for two bucks, you know, isn't this great, you know, but the thing, you know, but then you put all the stuff on it, you know, the rain, and all the silver and stuff and it would look like, you know, be a wonderful tree, but those times--unique times, both with my mother as well as my dad when I had those individual times with them, when no one--none of these other kids were around.  And you remember Don McNeill, he came out of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: The 'Breakfast Club' ['Don McNeill's Breakfast Club']?
Speaker 1: My mother, she would--big thing we would do and I would--just she and I--it was a kick, she would--they'd have a march, they usually have a march, and Don McNeill, and then my mother would march around the kitchen with me, you know, like I said I think with both of 'em it related to those unique times when I would--I'd just be with them and when I was--I graduated from Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington].  I was captain of my football team.  I was all-state in football, and my dad, you know, coming with me to the recognition ceremony, you know, in high school and then I went graduated from the UW [University of Washington, Seattle, Washington], you know, coming down to the Rose Bowl [Rose Bowl Game], him being there and wanting to be there and, I never, I never thought of him ever being at any of those games, I never, never entered my mind.  My younger son [Chandler Gayton] that I have, seventeen year old (laughter), he wants me at every game.  I didn't think my dad ever had the time, I was surprised, pleasantly surprised whenever I thought, you know, he'd show up, but sometimes I'd just see him there and never know it, but those were the things, that--thinking of my dad.  And I'll never forget the time that he took me a YWCA--YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] dinner and Jesse Owens was there, and they--Meredith Mathews--she's an Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] graduate.  She was a close friend of Jesse Owens and my dad took me, you know, I went to that Y thing together and met Jesse Owens and introduced by the--his close friend who is the head of the local YMCA [East Madison YMCA; Meredith Mathews East Madison YMCA, Seattle, Washington] here.  But it's those, those unique one on one things with both my mother and father that I remember most.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I did not have--you know, we just didn't have many opportunities because of the, you know, the size of the family, so all the kids were pretty, pretty independent.
Story_ID: 484705
Speaker 1: You should name your brothers and sisters probably for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well my oldest--the oldest one in the family is my sister Guela, G-U-E-L-A, named after--and her name is Johnson--the irony of that, which is my grandmother's [Guela Johnson Gayton] maiden name.  But she was named after my grandmother on my mother's [Virginia Clark Gayton] side.  I--Guela Gayton Johnson, and then Sylvia Wesley [Sylvia Gayton Wesley], then my brother John, John C. Gayton, Jr. [John C. Gayton].  He passed away about four years ago and then Gary [HistoryMaker Gary Gayton] and then Philip [Philip Gayton].  Philip was a businessman, my brother John was a business guy and then my younger brother Leonard [Leonard Gayton] who worked for and retired and worked for UPS [United Parcel Service] for many years.  And then my sister Elaine [Elaine Gayton Whitehead], who works as a secretary at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's it.  And then, you know, I don't if--I don't know what the next segment is but I've got, you know I have four children myself and so.
Speaker 1: Well I'm gonna ask about it.  Probably towards the end (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, okay.
Story_ID: 484706
Speaker 1: Where did you grow up?  You, I mean did--you grew up in the CD [Central District, Seattle, Washington].  Or was it another neighborhood other than (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, well the interesting thing about it, is as you get older how things change.  When I--I was born in the--what is now regarded as the CD. But when my parents [Virginia Clark Gayton and John J. Gayton] moved up into that neighborhood, 32nd [Avenue] and Pike [Street].  It was predominantly white and the--I was born the same year we moved, so they told me these stories about the whites, you know, throwing rocks at the windows, breaking the windows because we were the first blacks in the neighborhood.  But as I--as time went on and, you know, I'm going into, you know, my last, you know, sixth grade, you know, seventh grade, that's when blacks start to coming to the--more blacks started coming into the neighborhood (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that was called the Madrona [Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Madrona, right.
Speaker 1: I just remembered that from your brother's [HistoryMaker Gary Gayton] (laughter)--
Speaker 2: That's right, it was the Madrona neighborhood, and it was--when I was in grade school it was an interesting mix of, you know a handful of blacks.  Most of the blacks lived in the Madison Valley [Seattle, Washington] where my grandfather--I'd mentioned my grandfather lived in Ohio.
Speaker 1: That's a phenomenon that happens in a lot of cities that are--area of town that's not considered--well that wasn't considered the CD then, but now it is right?
Speaker 2: That's--well, it's, but it's changed again.
Speaker 1: It's changed back to Madrona now.
Speaker 2: It's almost back to the way it was when I was in grade school, you know, because of gentrification and so on, and because it's prime property, its primary, it's, you know, beautiful views, all sorts of thing--amenities, you're close to downtown, you're close to the theaters, the arts, all that sort of thing, so it's made this big--people, you know, I get a kick--I was on a panel just a couple of months ago after--well--yeah just a couple of months ago talking about changes in the Central District and I was saying, gosh it's not like the old days when, you know, blacks were in the CD and we had this, you know, real togetherness, and so we went to the same movies together and all this--everything was so great and nice at all the clubs.  But now, you know, it's all this gentrification and we, you know.  I wish it was like it was, you know, back in the day.  Well one thing I told 'em, I said, you know, reason why we all lived together don't you?  Because we couldn't move anywhere else (laughter) we were redlined and we lived in the ghetto, I said.  But we fought for open housing and so as a result, a lot of middle class blacks, you know, moved out and went to the other side of the, you know, over to the white, to the more affluent areas and left them more--poor folks.  But that's even changed now with this prime property and cheaper property in the South End [Seattle, Washington], you know.  Blacks have moved down to the South End because you get more for your money and so whites have moved in, and so people are lamenting the fact that, you know, so many whites have moved in, but the thing is, we had the property and we gave it up and there were a lot of--there was a small cadre.  Black families held onto their property and the property values went up, you know, went up considerably, but they, they hung in, but a lot of those decisions, were decisions that black families, you know had, had made.  But so, now we're going back to almost the way it was in terms of the black population in the, so-called, you know CD.  It was very similar to it what it was when I was going to middle school, going to junior high.  So things change, I mean we've gotten almost full circle over my lifetime in terms of the makeup of the Central District.
Story_ID: 484707
Speaker 1: What were some of the--we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's great, I, because you rem- as a kid you remember those smells, you know, and you don't--I don't know if it's there anymore or you don't take this time to smell 'em, you know, take time to smell the roses and I remember, you know, the wonderful, you know, smell of the rosebushes, the--you know, the (laughter) the lilacs, you know, the blackberry bushes on the vacant lots, you know, when the blackberries became ripened and my, you know, we'd always go out and get--here you have, you know, you'd bring in all these blackberries and make blackberry jam, blackberry cobbler pie, a blackberry juice, all those sorts of things.
Speaker 1: These are wild blackberry bushes?
Speaker 2: Wild blackberry bushes 'cause of the--well we don't have that many vacant lots anymore and so right across--right next door to us, a huge vacant lot of blackberry bushes.  In the summertime, we would just get all that, it would just be, just be wonderful, and you could walk anywhere, you know, you knew everybody in radius about two or three miles it seemed like and we, we'd--I would, you know, we--when I came along, you know, we couldn't afford bikes and all that, so we did a lot of walking, going down to the beach in the summertime and even though, you know, there were no signs saying blacks only, whites only, you knew going to Madrona Beach for example, which is part of the Central District [Seattle, Washington] that it was--on one side, that's where the blacks stayed, you know, you know, in the summertime.
Story_ID: 484708
Speaker 1: --The whites stayed on the other end, and so you would--there'd be this big, you know, you were really brave if you went on the side where the whites were 'cause, you know, they'd look at you funny and all that sort of stuff but there were no--again it wasn't like the South, where you had signs saying whites only and blacks only.
Speaker 2: No enforced segregation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, but you knew that you were, you know, you just knew that you were supposed to stay on your side and--there's a certain--you had these rafts out there in the water and, you know, the black kids wouldn't be with the whites at the other--sometimes a little bit of intermingling, but those were the kinds of things that--you 'member it was, you know, you didn't think of it as that offensive, not necessarily, I mean as a kid, you know, that was just part of growing up but, you know.  I always like to push the envelope and be on the other side and all that sort of stuff and see what people say, "Oh God you were over there," (laughter) and, you know, old days at the beach [Madrona Beach, Seattle, Washington], summertime as a kid and then, you know, just hiking through those vacant lots and building forts and those images, and all of us had paper routes, and interesting combination.  We lived right on the border of the, you, know, of the Gold Coast, you know, very wealthy.  On one end, it's almost like a Mason-Dixon Line, you know, you had the Madison Valley [Seattle, Washington] where we were, 32nd Avenue, and then you'd go into, you know, where, you know, the--where the Tennis Club [Seattle Tennis Club, Seattle, Washington] was and Broadmoor [Seattle, Washington], all these sort of special gated communities and all those kids interestingly enough, the majority of kids did not go to private school back in those days.  The white kids they went to Garfield [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] so you had this really, really interesting dichotomy of wealth and poverty going to the same school.  All the kids for the most part, very few went to private schools--nowadays, you know, you still have those gated communities, 90 percent of those kids go to private schools now.  But back in those days, it was, it was an interesting mix of folks, and Garfield was guarded, you know probably--not really the case, but they always considered that kind of a nirvana or, you know a microscope or microscopic, you know, United Nations.  And Quincy, he all--but he continues to talk about--[HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones, about his wonderful experiences there.  I had good experiences there too, if you just push aside all that other stuff and look at the positive of it.  Quincy, his primary mentor was a white gentlemen, Mr. Cook, Parker Cook, who encouraged Quincy to do everything, did the same thing with Jimi Hendrix and, you know, lot of it.  So those were wonderful, wonderful experience at that, at that school, not to say that it was a perfect situation.  There were limitations socially and all that sort of stuff that you knew about.  Most of 'em, you know, unspoken, unwritten, you know, kinds of things, you just knew, rather than forced upon you, but it was a pleasant growing up experience for me.  I can't speak for others, but I enjoyed it, with the blacks and whites--and there's a large Sephardic Jewish population too, in that Madrona [Seattle, Washington] neighborhood too, that I probably--my first swear words were Yiddish (laughter) back in the day and, and those kids they wanted to take me, what they called Talmud Torah, you know, where they, where they would--after school.  Yeah, they were--Hebrew classes, you know, so the kids would try--then a guy got stopped at the door, you know, by the headmaster, you know, no you can't come in here 'cause you're not Jewish, but--and still--and it's great being in this museum [Northwest African American Museum, Seattle, Washington] because a lot of those kids I grew up with are Jewish and otherwise blacks, you know, coming through here and talking about gosh back in the day, you know, reminiscing and all that sort of thing.  I mean the fact that I've been here for so long and that and--folks are still--they might be coming from Bellevue [Washington], you know, Mercer Island [Washington], all over the place, they may not live in the area anymore, but they're coming back, you know, this is a kind of a gathering place for the, whole, you know, the community.  And a lot of those folks back in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] are coming back here to, you know, to check out this place because a lot 'em went to school here and--so it brings back, you know, a lot of, you know, pleasant, pleasant memories and pleasant stories that kids have had.  And then there were some times to, but you know, you really didn't get into those things often, really until you became an adults and what adults tend to do to each other.  But the kids--wasn't that, you know, it was, it was enjoyable, you know certainly in my experiences.
Story_ID: 484709
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started school in Madrona [Seattle, Washington], which is Madrona grade school [Madrona School; Madrona K-8 School], which was a block away from my house and most, probably everybody in the family went to that school one time or other, and then from there Meany Junior High [Edmond S. Meany Junior High School; Edmond S. Meany Middle School], which was called Longfellow [Henry Wadsworth Longfellow School, Seattle, Washington] before my dad [John J. Gayton] even went to that school 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Meany, now was it named after George Meany by any chance?
Speaker 2: No--wait a second, no, no, no, no.  It was an educator from the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Now let, let me ask you something about you--your name, your name is Carver [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was there an intention on the part of your family name?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I'm very proud of that, my--the only one that--my dad said that he--my mother [Virginia Clark Gayton] allowed him to name, was me, and it was after George Washington Carver.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's--you know, and I, you know, I'm not a, you know, hard scientist, doctor, Ph.D.  But having that name certainly was part of my inclination to, you know, to do well and excel.  But I really didn't accept the name 'cause I thought it was too formal, you know, growing up.
Speaker 1: What did they call you coming up?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh they called me Butch, they called me Butch--and my brother, I'll never forget my br- so they can't--god, you gonna--going into high school, they can't be calling you Butch, you know, go by your name.  They were gonna call me--the question was I think everybody tended to agree that Butch was a little bit too informal going into high school and so the question was--and I was 'gonna use my middle name, which is Clark, or, you know, just stick with Carver.  And I've, you know, I've enjoyed, you know--I didn't have any problem whatsoever with my name.  But my son, Carver, Jr. [Carver Gayton, Jr.], he goes by Clark, yeah, he doesn't use Carver at all, he goes by Clark so which is great, so we have both my mother's and father's name for me and for him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, then, then from Meany--my dad went to that school too and then went on to Garfield [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] and then the University of Washington.

Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?

Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is October 18, 1938 in Seattle, Washington.
Speaker 1: And sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm basically retired right now.  But I'm doing--I guess you could call me, you know a public historian because I am doing some writing about my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your occupation before you retired and--I mean what, what, what are you best known for?
Speaker 2: Well, my last occupation--I've had a number of different jobs but the last, you know, full time job I had as the founding executive director of the Northwest African American Museum here in Seattle.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is October the 9th, 2017.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?  And you don't have to give your address, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We're at my, my home, my wife [Carmen Walker Gayton] and I's home in, in Seattle, Washington, in the Magnolia neighborhood.
Story_ID: 673088
Speaker 1: Now before--we are finishing an interview we started in 2007.  And so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at that time we covered your ancestors, or at least a lot about them anyway.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Your ancestors, we covered your mother's [Virginia Clark Gayton] side of the family, your father's [John J. Gayton] side of the family and we had you in grade school [Madrona School, Seattle, Washington] and middle school. And so just to be safe I'm going to ask you about, was that Meany Middle School, Junior High School, Meany Jun- Junior High [Edmond S. Meany Junior High School; Edmond S. Meany Middle School, Seattle, Washington] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, now that's in the CD, the area they call the CD here in Seattle [Washington] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's in, it's in the Central District of, of Seattle.  And I was there for the, my seventh and eighth grade.  And then when I moved into my ninth grade year I went to Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you were in, this is like '51 [1951] to '53 [1953]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you're at Meany.
Story_ID: 673089
Speaker 1: Now are you--'cause you became like a, a football star of, in--at some point, but were you playing football at Meany [Edmond S. Meany Junior High School; Edmond S. Meany Middle School, Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was playing, I was playing football, a little bit of football and that--and we really back in those days we didn't have organized football then.  It, I really did not get into organized football until the, you know, the ninth grade at, at Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] my freshman year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was pretty small for my, for my age you know back in those days.  But I, I liked the, the game of football and so I, I'll never forget it.  I told the, the head coach that I was going to be turning out for football and he said, "Well do--why--you're too small, Gay [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton].  Why don't you run, just run track like your brother did?"  And, and I said, "Well I'm going to turn out anyway."  And so, to make a long story short what, what had happened, there was a fellow who was on the varsity team that injured himself, he was a fullback on the team.  And one of the assistant coaches thought that I was going to be a pretty good ball player.  I'm still fairly small so he recommended to the head coach that I should be the starter in view of the fact of this fellow's injury.  And so, as a result, I played on two metropolitan championship, you know, football teams back to back as a--I was a fullback.  I was a 145 pound fullback.
Speaker 1: Fullback?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: These are the days when, now they just--usually teams have a running back.  They don't even call them a halfback or fullback but in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --those days, halfback is supposed to be the outside, back the--they ran the sweeps.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Out, the swing passes and the fullback actually plowed up the middle, right?
Speaker 2: They plowed up the middle and they also--'cause we played both ways, offense and defense back in those days.  And so, I, I played fullback.  I did, I did more blocking than running and I played--I, I was a, not a guard but I was--could we hold it?
Speaker 1: A linebacker (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically a linebacker.
Speaker 1: Yeah, on defense?
Speaker 2: I was a linebacker on defense.  And so, but played both ways and so I was able to tackle and, and, and to block fairly well and so my, my major job when I, particularly when I was a junior in high school was to block for the, block for the quarterback.  We had a real good quarterback and so he passed a lot.  And so, that's what I did.  But they found out, 'cause I also ran track.  They found out I was faster than they had anticipated and so I started taking the ball more but I was a fullback in my senior year.  But we had a state championship team my, my senior year and I was named as, as an all-state player on that team and, and you know as, as a fullback.  So, I was--I never considered myself a running back, I was just a, a, a person that liked to, liked to hit and liked to have that kind of conduct--contact and so as a result I did pretty well when, when it came to the, the recognitions.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's really something.  I mean a fullback (laughter), 145 pound fullback.
Speaker 2: Well, I had, I had a problem because you know later on when I, when I played football you know in college, they said you can't--they gave me--you, you're too small you know rather than trying to run through those guys you got to learn how to run around them.  And so, I, I, I did develop some I, I think better skills, running skills when I got older.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were all-state--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as a fullback--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in high school?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: This is something, at 145 pounds--
Speaker 2: Well, and also the, also the fullback punted and, and so I had to learn how to--that, that was required of the fullback and so I was a punter also on, you know on the team.  And I did, I did you know fairly well at that.  I did some punting in college but that wasn't my forte.
Speaker 1: Now when you watch football today, do you reflect that maybe people have it too easy?  I mean you played, you were playing two ways.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.  Well, you know I, I'm, you know, basically an old school type and I, you know I, I think that no one really had it as tough you know nowadays as, as we had back in those days in terms of how we played ball.  And type, the type of coach, coaches that I had in, both in high school and in college, they were pretty, pretty hardnosed coaches.  And, and so, I adjusted to that and I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I know when I oft- often see films of old football games, fellows that are scoring touchdowns late in the game, they look like they're running with weights on their feet.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: 'Cause they've been out there all day playing both ways.
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) you know.
Speaker 2: Well it was the, they used to call four, four yards and a, and a cloud of dust.  And the, you know you didn't have high scoring games back in those days.  Running, running and blocks and so on that they, those were the primary skills that you needed you know on offense.  The, the quarterbacking, you know the drop back quarterback types, that's something that's more prevalent now than it was back in, in those days.
Speaker 1: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: But, but I tried to, I tried to get--go on to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] to play 'cause that's the only place I wanted to, to play ball.
Story_ID: 673090
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now let me go back to high school--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and talk about--now what kind of student were you in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a, I, yeah, I really wasn't encouraged a great deal when it came to academics, you know.  I was, I was okay and then, and what I did was I you know, I focused on those classes that I, that I enjoyed as opposed to ones that I, I really should you know, you know really should work hard at.  And so, and so, it really wasn't until my, my junior year in high school that I really thought that I was, you know, an individual who could be able to, you know, to, to do well academically because I, I had a really outstanding language arts teacher, English teacher who told me, says, "Carver [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton] you know, you aren't working hard enough.  You're much brighter than you think you are.  So, I'm going to, I'm going to stay with you to make sure that you reach your full potential."  And her name was Miriam Eskenazi.  I'll never forget, she only taught one semester at Garfield [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] and I was fortunate to be able to have her as a teacher.  And I started getting A's in, in courses where we're studying Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] and--'Hamlet' and you know, 'Julius Caesar' and all that sort of business.  And so--
Speaker 1: What was her name again?  Again, can you say it slowly or spell it out for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Miriam, I'm, I'm, I'll spell it phonetically but it's M-E-R-R-I-M [sic.], Miriam, Eskenazi, E-S-K-A-N-Z-I [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Miriam Eskenazi.
Speaker 1: This is a Jewish name?
Speaker 2: A Jewish name and I think she was probably the only Jewish teacher at Garfield at that time.  But we still, I'm still in contact with her and she really made an impact on my life and gave me a sense of me being able to you know to, to move forward academically.  And so, I, I thought more of myself as a result of her focus on me.

Speaker 1: So, when you were in high school, now this is--now you're in high school during the early '50s [1950s], this is like Cold War time in the United States (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] is the president.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What was the popular music like in those days?  And what was--?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was really a transition period because that was the generation that really popularized you know rock and, rock and roll.  And so, we had, we had a band, I'll never forget out of, out of Garfield [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington].  It was probably the most popular band in, in Seattle [Washington], in the Seattle area, in the Puget Sound area called the Dave Lewis Combo.  And there was one other group called you know Dave, Dave Holden band [Dave Holden Trio].  But the two black bands and really when it came to the Civil Rights Movement there was probably more integration, especially among the younger people as a result of those bands and the different venues where, you know, where they played where blacks and whites you know came together.  So, it, you know, it was an important time musically and I think socially in terms of bringing blacks and whites together, particularly young people. Some of the older you know generation of parents of particularly the white kids, parents of the white kids had difficulty adjusting you know to that, that change in time you know socially.  I don't know, you know they may have enjoyed the music but, but socially they were, I think there was a little bit of concern about what was taking place too when it came to that impact of the music in those, in those days.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the movie 'Ray' about the life of Ray Charles depicts Ray Charles in Seattle meeting [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Young Quincy Jones.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, did you know Quincy Jones growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--Quincy Jones, I consider him a, a friend.  I, I really didn't, I didn't meet Quincy back in the early days because he was my--he went to Garfield High School and he was the age of my, my, my two older brothers, John [John C. Gayton] and Gary [HistoryMaker Gary Gayton].  And so, they knew him and would tell me about him back in those days about what a great musician he was and so on.  And I, you know later on you know would hear you know more about him.  But I really didn't meet him until years later when there was a, a big fundraiser for the community college system [Seattle Community Colleges District; Seattle Colleges District] here in Seattle.  And my cousin, Don Phelps [Donald Gayton Phelps] was the president of the community college system.  And, we, we're going to bring you know Quincy back here.  This is in early 1980s, in fact, it was right before 'Thriller' had come out.  And so, I was chairman of a committee at that time to bring him up here to be able to help raise money for the community college system.  And Quincy, I met him at a, a social gathering you know before we had this big, this big concert and fundraiser.  And he, he approached me like he had known, known me my whole life and, and just a, a, an outstanding individual, very personable and I was just pleased to be able to you know to, to meet him.  And we've had a connection ever since that time.  But interestingly when he did have that concert, my son, my oldest son, Carver, Jr. [Carver Gayton, Jr.] is a musician and he auditioned to play in the orchestra that was part of you know Quincy coming up here.  And that's you know an outstanding entertainer sort of part of that whole thing.  And he had auditioned without me knowing about it and, and was part of the orchestra that played at the, the concert.  He was a--he, my son is a, is, is a professional musician, travels the world with regard to his music.  So that was, that was something that was great.  But I still am in contact with Quincy.  Quincy also was part of the opening of our--the museum, Northwest African Ameri- Museum [Northwest African American Museum, Seattle, Washington] and had a, a great contribution by, by him and his associates for that, for that event.
Story_ID: 673092
Speaker 1: Now when you were a senior in high school, did you get a lot of offers to play football around the country, or?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was a senior I, I was commit- backing up a little bit, I was, you know I, I started getting more energy as you know, as you know recognition and I, I, to some degree as a football player and all that sort of thing.  And I ran for you know senior class president and so I won that so I was senior class president for our class of 19--1956.  And when I got these notices that I was you know on the all-state you know football team and I was going to play in the all-star game in Spokane [Washington] you know that year, and it was just something I had not expected.  It was just--you know I was kind of you know taking it all in and the only school that I wanted to go to was the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  And I asked my, my football coach at Garfield [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington], I said, "Could you give a good, you know, a good word for me, you know, out at the university to be able to, to play out there."  And he said, "Well Carver [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton] I want you to, you know to you know gain you know more weight 'cause you're pretty small and I don't, you know I don't think you should go to the, you know to, to the UW."  So, he kept saying--well, I, I kept--keep asking him.  I said, "When are you going to talk to the folks at the university?"  He said, "Well gain some more weight.  So, when you get to 170 pounds you know, talk to me.  I mean I'll take you out there."  And so, during track season I had a pretty good track team, you know second team all-city in track and all that sort of stuff.  And so, I said, "Now I'm up to 170 pounds." (Laughter) "When are you going to take me out there?"  So, he finally you know took me out here and introduced me to the, to the legendary Darrell Royal who was the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the coach at the University of Washington.
Speaker 1: Now he's, he's probably famous for being the coach of Texas--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --the Texas Longhorns [University of Texas Longhorns].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that was after he was coach at Washington.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had only been at Washington really one season, but he came to, when we had our recognition for our team because we had an outstanding football team at Garfield, he came to the auditorium, I'll never forget that and, and, and talked to us.  And so, I, I was introduced to him as well.  But, but finally I was able to convince my, my high school coach to, you know to introduce me to Darrell and, and I was pleased you know when, when we talked he says, "Well, Carver you know, you're, you're a little bit small but, but I heard about you and your dedication and your commitment you know to the, you know to the game and I think you could add something to our program out here."  And so, basically he gave me a full ride to the University of Washington for, for four years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know they're not just handing those out.  A full ride means that they really expect you to play a lot of football--
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --and be good (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 673093
Speaker 1: So, I went out there to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  Then, in between my freshman year and my sophomore year he, he left to go down to Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] and so, back in those days freshmen could not play varsity ball, but, but I was a starter on the freshman team and so, the, the following years I played you know, you know three years at the University of Washington and ultimately was, participated, was involved in you know a couple of Rose Bowl wins that we had.
Speaker 2: You were involved in them.  Now this is, this is a--let's go back and just, I (unclear), I want to frame this for whoever is watching this.  University of Washington, this is big time college football.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Division I football they call it now.  This is, the Rose Bowl is one of the premiere post season games in the country you know, if not the premiere--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --post season game in those days where the, was it Pac 8 [Pacific 8 Conference] then, then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was, called the Pacific Coast Conference then and what had happened because of some, some you know violations in recruitment and that sort of thing we were on you know suspension for (unclear).  We weren't eligible for any, any bowl game for two years that, that I played there.  So, the year we, we became eligible, that's the year that we went to the, to the Rose Bowl.
Speaker 2: So, you were on the team (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I started, the--my senior year I was a, you know the starting running back, we called them wing back you know, you know back in those days.  And I had played against Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado].  Had one of the best games I ever had.  But then the, the following game I had a major injury and, and just tore all the ligaments and cartilage in my, in my knee so I thought I, my whole career--it was really devastating to me--it was over when it came to, to football.  But they kept trying to rehabilitate my, my knee and so on and so forth.  And so, but I was able to play against Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] in that, in that game and returned a, you know, returned a punt.  But I was only--
Speaker 2: This was around 1960?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was for the, the '60 [1960] Rose Bowl.
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960] Rose Bowl.  That's when Wisconsin, and I don't know why I remember this but they had a quarterback named Ron Vander Kelen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) is that it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And who was on the Washington team?  Who was--?
Speaker 1: Well, we have Bob--we had a really fine you know running back that, that we kind of alternated back and you know, back and forth back when we were juniors and that was George Fleming who had--and, and then Bob Schloredt.  Both of them were the, the MVPs [most valuable player] of the Rose Bowl.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Who was the quarterback on that team?
Speaker 1: Bob Schloredt.
Speaker 2: Bob Schloredt, okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And we had a fine, fine team.  One of the things that you know, that, that's constant in relation to my--whatever success I've had is the whole concept of team.  I never considered myself you know just the, you know, the, the old premiere you know, you know athlete.  But I, I was able to work within a team environment and what, what's happened--what happened in high school for example was the first back to back championships that, that Garfield [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] has, has ever, has ever had and it was the first time in years that they had won a championship.  And then the Rose Bowl that we went to in 19--1960 was the first Rose Bowl that the University of Washington had ever, had ever won.  And you know, we were playing for years and years in the Rose Bowl.  But, so that was something significant.  And then the following year when I was a graduate assistant coach, we won, we were co-national champions and this is the, my national championship--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah, ring that we have (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Who, who was the other national, I mean the--?
Speaker 1: I forget who the other team (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Who the other team was.
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's Mississippi [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi] or whatever.  But anyway I, I, I forget who the other, other team was.  Yeah, I, I just, I just concentrate on one (laughter).
Speaker 2: They, they probably forgot you all too (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: But this is a, you know, Rose Bowl pits the top team in the Big Ten [Big Ten Conference] versus the top ten and the Pac, I think in the Pac 8 then, but you had like UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, USC was a, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Oregon [University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon] you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, USC was, you know was a, our, our primary, primary target but over the years you know I played you know with teams like Colorado, you know played, you know played at Columbus [Ohio] against you know Ohio State [The Ohio State University] you know, we played--gosh I'm trying to think of some of the, some of the other teams you know at this point.  But there were a number of--our, our major competition outside of our league was, was over in the Big Ten.  And so, we were you know, we were a premiere, a premiere program.  And, and you know, Darrell Royal and, and you know Jim Owens, they came out of the south, southwest and so they really changed the whole--not only the direction of college football at the University of Washington but for the whole Pacific Coast Conference to a significant degree.  And so, we're--it was just, just a great opportunity to be able to play you know for a team like that.  And--but my point being that it's you know, the, the whole team concept, being able to have that, the right ingredients you know to make you know a, a team operate in a way in which they're going to be leaders, that's something that, that's not only important in my experiences in sports but it's also the, the kind of concept that I try to you know work into you know my professional life and, and the organizations that I've worked for, working within a team, that kind of team environment.
Story_ID: 673094
Speaker 1: Aside from football, I mean, what was your major at U- UDub?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my major at University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] was history and my minor was, was English.  And it was an interest- you know looking back on these things you know you, you don't realize certain things.  But I, you know there weren't too many blacks for example that were going to the University of Washington in, in those early years.  In fact, you know you could, you could count on one hand the number of blacks and, and the, the largest percentage of blacks you know tended to be you know athletes in those days.  But, but you stop and think that the, the Rose Bowl that we played in, in 1960, there were only four blacks on that team.  And I remember--and I didn't realize it 'til after my mother [Virginia Clark Gayton] died, she had collected all of these articles from the black dispatchers across the country, friends that she had you know like the Los Angeles Sentinel, the you know Chicago Defender, Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], the Kansas City Call [The Call].  She had had these front page, front page articles and photographs of the four of us, the largest, the largest number of what they call front line, front line cour- front like ball players who ever played in the Rose Bowl at the time, four.  And so, that's, that was--that really you know meant something to me.  And I--the, the fact that my mother had collected all those that I didn't know about until we were going over all of her material after she had passed on--
Speaker 1: Now you did you ever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --it was really something.
Story_ID: 673095
Speaker 1: Did you ever have, now I know there--when you read about the stor- well the histories of Jim Brown and they even made a movie about Ernie Davis' career called '42.'  Is it '42'?  No, it's not '42,' but it's 'The Express,' right, about the career of Ernie Davis at Syracuse [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York].  And they had, they, they had the scene of him going to play in Texas and Jim Brown described the same kind of atmosphere when you go to the Cotton Bowl [Cotton Bowl Classic] you know, white players are trying to kill you, you know if you're a black player.  I mean they were really, I mean it was--and the, the--he couldn't, I mean it was issues about where he was going to stay you know, surrounded by all kind of racism, and attacks you know centered on you know the black star on the Syracuse team.  Did you have any issues like that in terms of where you were going to stay on the road or travel issues or, when you were with Washington?
Speaker 2: Well, you know the places that we went you know traveled to were either on the coast, you know.  One of the other major teams back in those days was Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] and so, and so, we didn't' go into the, you know the Deep South.  You know I, I--
Speaker 1: You didn't play in the SEC [Southeastern Conference] you know?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  In fact, I guess it was Bill O'Brien that really you know changed the, you know whole, all the territory when it came to football when he, as I understand there was a game that he played I guess it was USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] and he got beaten and he had all these black ball players on, on the USC team.  And I--probably didn't have any more than four (laughter) than we had, but he saw that, you know he was losing out.  He wanted to be the, you know the best and he said, he came to the conclusion that he needed to be, start bringing in black ball players.  So, that was right about the time that you know I was playing but you know I heard these stories about oh, other black ball players in other parts of the country having that difficulty but I never, I can't recall anything that happened along that line--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I was there.  And there may have been some things, but here I am, I start off going to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] at seventeen, you know.  I, my--'cause my birthday is you know, kind of in between so I always started school earlier.  It wasn't because of any academic prowess (laughter).  It's just because I was born you know at a time when they would bring in kids who were four years old in school and so I was always--tended to be the youngest.  But I was so concentrated on playing ball and making it in ball, you know maintaining my eligibility, I just wanted, I just wanted to play football.  And I don't, I don't recall those other things but I, I know one thing that I recognized there, of the four guys on the, four black guys on our Rose Bowl team, two of us, two of us played left halfback and the other two of us you know played fullback.  And so, you--back in those days they would call it you know stacking and years later you know when there was some difficulties at the University of Washington with our old coach when it came to race and so on, one, one of the guys that I played with, his name was Luther Carr [Luther Carr, Jr.], Luther "Hit and Run" Carr.  Really a fine, fine athlete, but he was a year ahead of us in that team that played on the Rose Bowl.  But, but George Fleming and I played left halfback and yeah, you know Joe Jones you know played you know fullback (unclear) Ray Jackson was the other black ball player.  And so, there, there was a concern about that 'cause we were really good ball players and, and one thing that Luther said about that, so the, the reason why they only had us playing left halfback was because they felt, they probably felt we could only run to the right, you know (laughter).  But he'd--Luther would always have you know statements of you know that sort.  But we, you know--I won't, you know I won't get into you know which you know ball players were better and so on, black and getting you know into that whole thing.  But that was interesting to note that we did have that kind of stacking that you know that (unclear).
Speaker 1: So the black players, if something happen to a black player, another black player could take his place?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But it couldn't take place with a white one?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that, you know that was the, you know that was the connotation, but I don't want to diminish the other you know white ball players that you know played.  But that was, that was you know something that you know the- certainly folks in the black community noticed.
Story_ID: 673096
Speaker 1: Yeah I just wanted to reflect a little bit back on the Rose Bowls in those days.  Now I read before, I think it was two weeks ago I found out that a fellow named George Taliaferro--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I remember the name (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --lived in, near Hamilton, Ohio in a retirement community and he was the quarterback for Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] and took them to the Rose Bowl and they actually won it, the only time Indiana was ever in a Rose Bowl (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, yeah, 'cause it--yeah.
Speaker 1: Black quarterback, George Taliaferro.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember the name, yeah.
Speaker 1: And he becomes the first black player drafted by the National Football League [NFL] even though he didn't, he decided to play in the All-American Conference [sic. All-America Football Conference] you know--
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: --for--it wasn't the Browns [Cleveland Browns], it was another team he played for in the All-American Conference and then when that dissolved I think he played a year for the Bears [Chicago Bears] or something, George Taliaferro.  And then when--your second Rose Bowl championship is, it had to be in '61 [1961], it's the year after you left right, college?
Speaker 2: It was the--
Speaker 1: You were a coach right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: It was a '60 [1960]--yeah.  It was a '60 [1960], '61 [1961] season and the '61 [1961] Rose Bowl we played Sandy, Sandy Stephens from Minnesota.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now Sandy Stephens, now this excited a lot of black people 'cause we were watching this on TV I think for the first time now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Sandy Stephens was a black quarterback for the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] of all places.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, 'cause I know, I--my brother was excited, I was excited.  All the black people I knew were excited about that because--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he was a black quarterback.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Well, that was the--in fact Minnesota was the first team that I played against when I was a sophomore [at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington] outside of you know, outside of you know, outside of Seattle [Washington].  So, for a young guy, here I was a sophomore and we're traveling to Minnesota and you know, played them--and they were, they had good teams you know back in those days.  And so, that was quite an experience for me.  And I, I can't recall.  I don't know if Sandy you know, he was a year, would have been a year behind me at least so I don't think he was a--no, I don't, in fact I know, I think it was somebody, a Cox [Bobby Cox] or, I'm trying to remember what his--but there was another fellow who was the, the quarterback then.  But that was, Minnesota you know stays in my mind because that was the first Big Ten [Big Ten Conference] team I played against and it was a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, great, great experience.  But I, you know, the fact, you know I look back and I say god, here--I'm the only kid, kind of--I really had a fine you know, high school program [at James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] and the only one who went on to, to a Division I team out of my, out of my group.
Story_ID: 673097
Speaker 1: Now, did you suffer any permanent damage to your knee?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well I've got, well that knee thing was something because it, they diagnosed it, they gave me the, the bargain basement thing.  They just took out the cartilage.  But every, every ligament in you know my knee was torn then.  It was just torn apart.  And people say, well it's only cartilage, well it wasn't.  It was more than that.  Doctors later on said it was lucky they--back in those days they didn't have the skills they have now so lucky they didn't do any more than, than just to take out the, the cartilage.  But just a few years ago I had a whole knee replacement you know.  I got a big piece of titanium in my you know leg right now.  And when they operated they took out, the doctor said they took out you know, an accumulation of calcium as big as, big as my fist in there.  So, this is reconstructed (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: This had, this had to bother you for the rest of your life basically.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah I, I worked on it.  It's all, you know it's all about the physical therapy and so you making it you know function right.  But before--but I played a whole season with my shoulder out of socket, completely dislocated.  And so they put a, you know it's almost like something out of the dark ages they put a, a leather strap you know around my chest and you tie it up in a--literally two pieces of metal chain to hold the, hold, try to hold it in--
Speaker 1: So, it wouldn't come out?
Speaker 2: --so it wouldn't come out and then another leather strap here.  So, I played the whole season with that and I'll never forget, I was playing against Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and, and tackled a guy you know, I shouldn't have tackled him with my arm 'cause it was out of joint.  Yeah, it was separated.  And--but that was when--the longest I, I--you know, I played a whole, whole season that way my junior, yeah my junior year.  But the whole thing came out and it took about yeah, fifteen minutes you know for the doctors to put it back in, in joint, back in the joint, but I was out playing again the next week you know, you know with that.  And, the, the--it's crazy you know something to think about what you do when you're a kid.  But the, the coach [Jim Owens] would say, "Carver [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton] how you, you know, how you doing?  You know how you--you know, I noticed, after the game," he said, "I noticed you're holding your, your arm down you know," and I said, "God, I was?  I had no idea."  But it, but wasn't--that, I guess I was trying to compensate for the, you know for the pain and so on.  But, I had that, that's, whole--this whole thing has been reconstructed with the muscles and all that, and I still have a little piece of metal in there.  But, then I have both metal and, and, as, as well as plastic or whatever in here.  But those are the--and then I have (laughter), I have a crushed--because we used to, we used to block and tackle with our heads and we--you know before we, every practice we would have an exercise to build up the muscles in our neck 'cause that's the way we're told to block and to tackle with, start with our--.  And a lot of, lot of--and the white guys you know they have a, higher bridges than us, those of us who are black heritage and so the, the helmet would come down and, and when you're blocking that way and so you could tell who played back in those days for a lot of the white guys 'cause they have a scar across their, the bridge of their nose.  But we didn't have--'cause I have you know, a small bridge, didn't have to worry about that.  But it did have an impact on my, on my neck in that I have a crushed vertebrae there that's, there, the--I just had--I didn't realize that until just about a year ago there were--"So, what, what did you do to get that, you know?"  And I said, "I, I assume it was from playing ball."  But luckily I don't have any real nerve, nerve damage from, from that.  But I've had, I had had some neck pains.  When I had an exam one time I had a neck pain and one of the doctors who knew about the fact that I played ball, they said, "Well you must have played ball in the late '50s [1950s] because you have calcium deposits all on your vertebrae all (unclear)."  But the only one, only, luckily only one crushed, crushed vertebrae.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) yeah.
Speaker 2: But, but you know you live--so most of the guys in my era you know, we get together often and, well you know at least every you know three or four years and you know we got walkers and all that other sort of stuff going out there (unclear).  But you know, it's just nice, it, you know, it, it was another era, another time but I, you know I have no regrets having gone through it.  But I didn't, I have a, you know, a young son, I--well, I have three sons and, but I'm kind of glad they didn't you know go through it.  You don't like to have your children go through, with the pain that I, I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Now, now did you--
Story_ID: 673098
Speaker 1: Now did you ever experience yourself or see some, or, or, or when you reflect on it now do you recognize anybody as having like that CTE [chronic traumatic encephalopathy] they--the memory problems and the--?
Speaker 2: Well, there's some, there are some but it's hard to determine because I see a lot of people, you know, my age you know, I'll, I'll be seventy-nine [years old] next week you know have these same problems and it's hard to say whether or not they're--
Speaker 1: Where it came from?
Speaker 2: --directly related but I'm sure it's you know it's a, it's a factor.  I'll, I'll never forget we played against Willie--I don't know if you remember the name Willie Wood you know--
Speaker 1: Yes, Willie Wood.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: He was a, back for the Green, Green Bay Packers--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All Pro, right.
Speaker 2: All Pro.  And I played against him.  He was quarterback at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].  People don't--forget that.  And I, I played against him and my--probably the, the biggest play I ever had playing ball was there was chase, chasing--he was out ahead of us about you know probably about ten or fifteen yards and I was able to catch him before he got to the goal line.  But (laughter), but he, he--I was mentioning him because I've seen him testify before [U.S.] Congress and he has that CTE problem.  But I knew a guy for example played with--he would get a concussion every game.  I mean he--and they'd take him out and he'd be back in the next week.  And he became a superintendent of a school district (laughter) here in the State of Washington.  So, I don't--and, and he seems to be, seems to be normal.  But I, I, you know, I see my youngest son [Chandler Gayton] and I said, you know I said, "I had a concussion in, in high school [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington]," and tell, I tell my young son, I said, I said, "But I'm--look at me, I'm okay."  He said, "Well let's talk about that, dad."  (Laughter) But, but any rate, I just had you know--I may have had other concussions.  But, but I had one where I was completely you know knocked out, had to be carried off the field in high school.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, sounds like you had a tough, I mean football was--is, is, or is--it was tough then and it is now.
Speaker 2: It's tough now.  It's a, it's a tough game but they, they've done so much more to try to avoid you know the kinds of head injuries we've had in the past.  And so, you know it--the object is not to hurt people and that's--the game is not about to hurt people.  It's, you know it's, but it's about hard hitting and doing it in a safe way.  And so everything that you know, if we're going to still have the game you know do everything possible to, to ensure hopefully you know to have fewer injuries than we, than we have now.  But that's, that's, that's part of the, you know, part of the game.  So, I don't know moving forward I don't know what's going to, what will happen.  But you know, I think they need to, need to continue to see means by which we don't have the kind of terrible injuries we've had in the past.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Things--when you, in the era where you played they had just start, started putting face guards on helmets right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's interesting you mentioned that because my coach in high school, I'll never forget, my freshman and sophomore year we didn't have face guards.  And, and he would say, the coach would say, "Well the only way I could determine whether or not my players are, you know, are working hard you know is whether or not they have any bruises on their, you know, on their cheeks (demonstrates)."  (Laughter) But I was pleased to see the, you know the face guards.  But the, but the things is they were so, they aren't as elaborate as they--there was just one bar across when I first started--
Speaker 1: Right (unclear)--
Speaker 2: When I first started.
Speaker 1: --by I guess 1961, '62 [1962] they were like a double bar--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --reinforced and then some, then the linemen got a cage like thing over their faces and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I remember Bobby Layne was the last--
Speaker 2: Bobby Layne, yeah.
Speaker 1: --NFL [National Football League] quarterback to play with no face guard.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: He just had no face guard and we, we thought it was funny as kids.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Said what--he's going to get messed up.
Speaker 2: Well, it's another age and you know things, things are changing.  But yeah I, I don't, I don't say well I wish I had done something differently because I was part of a, a great, a great era and some great memories of you know, comradeship and, and (unclear).
Speaker 1: Are you still (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but my wife [Carmen Walker Gayton] she's a Clemson [Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina; Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina] graduate and she knows more about football than I do.  I, you know I, I enjoyed playing the game.  I don't watch it as much as you know most other folks.  You know, I watch the, you know, the big games and, and stuff.  I try to follow my you know my, my team and you know and the Seahawks [Seattle Seahawks], but not to the degree that you know a lot of other folks do.  Am I'm not saying that--I've just got--you know I just got other, I just kind of move on to other--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --interests and stuff.
Story_ID: 673099
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about history.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you graduated with a B.A. in history in 1960, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1960.
Speaker 1: And now what was the history department like at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] then?  I think, I mean this is the era, if I'm correct that, that is before black history was a big thing too study in school.  There were some people talking about it and some of the East Coast schools but I don't know, did you have any African American history or Negro history in 1960?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I was (unclear) and just to give you a sense of the, the times, I never, there was never another black in any of the classes I took, you know history or otherwise, at, at the University of Washington, no other blacks and, and very few other you know minorities.  I did get pretty close with and admired, a fellow by the name is Tom, Thomas Pressly [Thomas J. Pressly] who was a Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate and is regarded as one of the you know outstanding you know historians and not only at the University of Washington but, but nationally.  And we did get into the black issues 'cause the Civil Rights Movement was, you know, was just you know beginning you know to (unclear) up in those years.  And we did get into some discussion of, of blacks and, and the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was a traditionalist, a very good lecturer.  In fact, he took a, a liking you know to, to me, very gentlemanly.  Thomas Pressly's from, he was a southerner from Tennessee as I recall and, but had his Harvard, Harvard degree.  And he would you know, when I'd come in and talk to him and--'cause other professors didn't do that.  And it's part of that southern hospitality I guess.  He said, "Mr. Gayton [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton]," calling me mister, here I am a teenager (laughter), "Mr. Gayton, have a seat now.  Let me talk to you--," and I, you know and so I talked to him and I really enjoyed his, his classes but then I'll never forget.  There are a couple of things that come up as, as it relates to, to him but they're talking about--there are two things.  Yeah, he said, "What this whole business is in relation to race relations and civil rights," he says, "it's a power, it is a, fundamentally a power issue.  You know some people would call it you know white privilege and all that but then you're saying," you know it, it's fundamentally when he said it was a power issue it really--now when we talk in terms of white privilege you know I think that's what he was probably referring to in those, in those days, maintaining power is what it boiled down to in terms of the majority.  The other thing is he showed some clips and, and it, and it really is related--you know my studying of my [maternal] great-grandfather [Lewis Clarke] and his histories, activists against slavery, he said they was interviewing one person about why he--a, a white gentleman down south or a white man down south and they said, "You know why are you against integration?"  He says, he says, "I really don't know.  It's just something that's stuck in my craw.  Something that's stuck in my craw."  Well, I can relate to that and people say when, when you start to use terms like a person is prejudice or racist or whatever, it relates to what that man had said from my point of view. The impact of race relations, the impact of the worst form of slavery we had in the history of, of this country of the world there are things that are stuck in the craw of folks, probably you know both black and, and white that we can't you know we just have a view of the world because we had three hundred years of, of slavery and the remnants of that are still with us.  And if we, until we--from my point of view until we recognize you know that phenomenon truly, we aren't going to be able to make progress.  We don't--and people say, well you know that's something that happened in the past and so on.  But the thing is, these things are stuck in our craw and if we don't at least recognize that we aren't going to be able to move forward to dealing with the issues when it comes to race relations you know in, in the future.  So, that was something that, that came through, that was back in the late '50s [1950s].  And so that, well that's as real today as it was back when that gentleman who was anti-black said it.  He said, "I can't explain it," he says, "just something, it's, it's in me."  Well, that's understand- from my point of view you know that's understandable but, but we got to, (laughter) we, we got to confront that phenomenon you know.
Story_ID: 673100
Speaker 1: Now let, let me ask this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --now you were different from, and, and, and you are still different from a lot of African Americans who don't have a lot of personal history that's available in a family where they have ancestors that were participating on a, on a high level in our liberation struggle and so forth and even know about--I mean some--most black people don't know much about their history, their own family history.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, and, and doing these interviews, I've interviewed almost seventeen hundred people, very few of them have any, any his, family history that they can discuss that goes past their grandparents--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --you know.  They know, they have a hazy notion of what slavery was and I've even had a couple of people tell me that their parents were born in slavery which is impossible but they, they don't even know when slavery ended.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, but you had an advantage on, on some level but were you cognizant or aware of that when you were at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington]?  Were you as aware of your family story as you are--well, I know you weren't as aware then as you are now, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --were, but did you have a (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, there always--I, I think again, this is something that's been embedded in me but you know from my mother's [Virginia Clark Gayton] you know history and I, you know I, my mother--here's this book and I, I, I keep it this way in, in the plastic because it's, it's old, 1853, 'The Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin' [sic. 'A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin,' Harriet Beecher Stowe].  My mother when we were children she would read from this book about my great-grandfather who was the George Harris within Harriet Beecher Stowe's 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.'  And so, he was the, he was the rebellious you know quadroon slave in that, in that book.  And so, we, we had a sense of what, you know, of, of history and a sense of what we were--but the thing is we didn't get any reinforcement when you went to school you know.  And I, it, it kind of made me stop and think, well gosh, if he's so important, why aren't they talking about it in school?  So, it was in there within me but I didn't take it really seriously until later on in terms of what he had accomplished and, and what it meant and my mother having gone to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and all that.  You know that, that was you know certainly within me.  But the thing that we need--I really think we need to understand there's a, a book that I started reading back in the you know late '60s [1960s], it's one, called--oh, from Cobbs and Brewer--Cobbs [Price M. Cobbs] and Grier [William H. Grier], two black psychiatrists out of the University of California, Berkeley [Berkeley, California] and--called 'Black Rage' ['Black Rage: Two Black Psychiatrists Reveal the Full Dimensions of the Inner Conflicts and the Desperation of Black Life in the United States'].  And one of the things that they pointed out there is that we as a, as a people here in America, you really don't have any continuity from you know one generation to the next with regard to what we're about, what--our history and our accomplishments, our culture and so on and so forth.  And they make mention of you know, you know of, China--people of Chinese ancestry and the people of Jewish ancestry who, who make it a point within their culture to pass on this information you know one way or the other from gen- one generation to the next so there's a sense of pride generally speaking with regard to those you know those two cultural entities.  And I think that that's fundamental to us to be able to do that but I, I--yeah I remember teaching a class at the University of Washington back in the late '70s [1970s] when I finished up my, my Ph.D. there and I was, you know had some you know, these you know kids you know that, you know you had the Civil Rights Movement of the 60s [1960s] and the Black Power movement of you know, you know going from the 60s [1960s] to the '70s [1970s] and so on.  But I was talking to some of these black students of mine you know within that, in the class and they had no recollection of what happened back ten years before, you know.  So, it, you know if there's anything that needs to be done in terms of dealing with these issues of, of having pride in yourself, pride in your family and so on, there needs to be this concentrated effort you know for, you know, 'cause, 'cause my feeling is even though there are some blacks that I know who, who don't want to have anything to do with, with slavery or talking about it at all, because they, they say you know it's, it shows weakness or something.  I was talking to some young people, they said, "You know why are you writing about slavery?"  Said, "Those slaves you know they should have--why didn't they just run off?  Why didn't they just run off?"  You know, well if you read my book you know you'll understand the, the impact of slavery and what it did, not--my grand, [maternal] great-grandfather [Lewis Clarke] would not talk as much about the physical atrocities, he'd talk about the emotion and intellectual atrocities that made you feel less than human.  And so those are things you know that we need to understand and the Jewish community as an example, you know when they moved out of, out of Egypt and when they were enslaved and so on, and they, they take pride in the fact that they were able to overcome slavery.  They're able to overcome you know the discrimination.  They were able to overcome the Holocaust and so on.  And, and we do have, like I said we do have a rich history and a culture you know within the, the black community that we need to build on.  But I am disappointed to hear people both young people as well as adults who say well you know we don't, we don't have a culture.  We don't have a history.  Well, yeah we do and we need to be proud of the fact that we're able to survive you know the, the--one of the worst atrocities in the history of the world and that is the institution of slavery in this country and that we're here to talk about it.
Story_ID: 673101
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was asking you off camera about Dr. Jones who was a Seattle [Washington] historian.  He wrote ear- I guess he was writing by the late '60s [1960s].  He write--he had a book--
Speaker 2: Well, he--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) in black history sort of the (unclear).
Speaker 2: Ed Jones [Edward L. Jones].
Speaker 1: Ed Jones, okay.
Speaker 2: Ed Jones.
Speaker 1: And people around here called him Cadillac Jones [ph.] for some--right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was--'cause he always drove a Cadillac (laughter).  But he, he was doing things revolutionary back in the early days 'cause he was telling folks that you know all human, the entire human race you know came out of Africa you know, and telling--he, he was telling you know--and some Native Americans really got aggravated out at the university [University of Washington, Seattle, Washington] saying that that's where humanity came, came from (unclear).  Well, the science came back years later, he was saying that in the late, he was saying that in the 19--in the 1950s.
Speaker 1: Now this, it was controversial at one time I know because--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he didn't have any, he didn't have the, he didn't have the research yeah--
Speaker 1: Well, there, there was a controversy in academia even and there's a debate between J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] and George Seifert [sic. George Schuyler] of New York [New York] about it.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: And Seifert said that black people, I mean all people came out of Africa.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Rogers was saying it came out of Asia.  The science in the early or in the late '40s [1940s] at least backed Rogers more than it did Seifert but Seifert actually was right even though he didn't have the science on his side.  Then later on when, when (unclear) and the rest of them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you had that--you, you started to get the DNA and all that sort of business from Ethiopia, and I guess it was Ethiopia--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) the fossilized bones first--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then do a DNA at that point but they, they found that they could carbon.
Speaker 2: Well the anthropology yeah and that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Carbon date--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --the fossils and they knew they were the oldest remains of human like or human ancestors.
Speaker 2: Well, even, even the black, what, what Langston [Langston Hughes] called the Negroatte [ph.], he didn't say Negro (laughter).  But it, were against, speaking out against Jones you know for, for saying that.  But you know it wasn't until--it kind of reminds me when it comes to that sort of business is that when I was writing my book I was trying to go to some of the traditional publishers and they said, "Well, you have all you--you know, you don't have secondary sources, you have prim- you have prim- primary sources you know like, like letters and like you know articles and all that sort of.  Secondary sources were from other academics."  And I said, "Well how did the academics you know get the secondary you know information you know?  They had to, you know someone had to start somewhere and they had to be primary sources."  So, you get into that, that kind of debate and that's probably what, what some of the issues were with regards to--
Speaker 1: But Jones--
Speaker 2: --Jones.
Speaker 1: So, he was a frequent guest in your parents' [Virginia Clark Gayton and John J. Gayton] home?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was a--yeah, because we knew him as an actor.  I mean he would--we had black plays and so on and he would produce plays and he would act in these, in his plays.  And he was my sister's era.  He--and once he died about three or four, I don't know four or five years ago, but he, he and my sister, he would come over to the house all the time.  And he was a, a real colorful guy, very bright and you know knowledgeable but he, he was a renaissance man.  He did all sorts of things.  But he was into you know poetry reading, you know producing plays, acting in plays and--
Speaker 1: Now was there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that, that's how I knew him.
Speaker 1: Was there a black theater company in Seattle (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a Black Arts/West [Seattle, Washington] and, and it was up on what we call thirty- 34th and--34th [Avenue] and Union [Street] where we would have plays.  And I'm sure he had plays up, up there.  But he had things there, that was in the '50s [1950s].  I think he had things, you know late 1950s.  He had things before then even.  I think, I think he came here in, in the [U.S.] military if I'm not mistaken.  But he was--we respected you know him.  In fact, he may have been teaching courses out at the university before any other blacks but he didn't, you know he didn't have the you know the academic aura as a--
Speaker 1: Was he a Ph.D. of such as far as you know of (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I may be mistaken but I don't recall him having a, you know, a Ph.D.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I remember him being you know being introduced as Dr. Jones.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they may, yeah so, he may, he may have but I, I, but I know he, he--I know he wasn't on a tenure track, you know for, within any of the departments out there.  But, but I, you know I, you know as a kid you know I remember him coming over and just a raconteur and all--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I--when we met him in Chicago [Illinois] in '76 [1976] he was at the Association for the Study of African American Life and History conference in downtown Chicago.  I guess he was attending that and he came over to Third World Press on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] with his, with a copy of his book.  And I, I, I'm the one that greeted him in the bookstore and talked to him.
Speaker 2: Oh, is that right?
Speaker 1: And I say he's all the way in Seattle and he's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --talking about black history. And yet, I can tell he was knowledgeable.  He was impressive--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) know but he seemed you know, a, a bit old timey in some ways in those days.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But he was--
Speaker 2: And very, talked very proper.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But he's one of those guys, he probably before his time.  I think he tried to get, you know I don't know if he tried to get into medicine or something.  There was a--but he was out there at the university before a black, before anybody else I--you know, almost.  I mean there are others who were in the '20s [1920s] that I know of.  But in terms of you know my memory line, he was you know like you know one or two folks involved in the university, blacks.
Speaker 1: And his name is Earn- Earnest you said?
Speaker 2: No, Ed, Ed Jones.
Speaker 1: Ed, Ed Jones, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Ed Jones, Edward Jones, okay.
Speaker 2: Edward Jones, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 673102
Speaker 1: Well you were saying, this is interesting.  We interviewed, yesterday we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Donald Byrd, the choreographer.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And he was talking about how he thought he knew what he was doing but he really didn't know he knew what he was doing until Alvin Ailey whispered in his ear--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you really know what you're doing (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So it was reinforce- so as you were saying you know all this family history--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but there's nobody--the academy doesn't reinforce any of it.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, let me give you another example.  My, my first job out of college [University of Washington, Seattle, Washington]--well let, let me back up a little bit.  I mentioned Thomas, Tom Pressly [Thomas J. Pressly], professor.  Interestingly, I had such regard for him.  He helped me get my job, my very first job along with my coach at Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington].  Here I am coming directly out of the history department and they, they talked to you know the folks at Garfield.  And so I was able to start off as a twenty-one year old teacher at Garfield High School.  Okay, but this gentleman helped me.  And I, I start teaching--in fact I was hired by the English department initially at, at Garfield.  Taught you know language arts and contemporary problems and which was great.  But years later interestingly enough, when I found out about this narrative that my [maternal] great-grandfather [Lewis Clarke] had, had written, I found out you know through the--my, my mother's cousin who was the son of Lewis Clarke's, one of Lewis Clarke's daughters.  And find out we had this, (unclear) we're talking about 1970, had the--and so, he had this book and, and I mentioned it in, in my book of how that all came about how we found out about it.  But anyway, I was so impressed you know the fact that we have this book you know this is the, the authoritative thing that he had that had been talked about in that, in that book, 'Uncle Tom's'--'Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin' ['A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin,' Harriet Beecher Stowe].  And so, I was so impressed I got in contact with my old, my old friend you know Thomas Pressly.  This is in the early '70s [1970s] and I said, "I got something for you.  I want to surprise you."  And I wrote a real long introduction in there and all that because he you know, he impressed me and, and took me under his wing.  But I told him about the narrative and he said, "Well this really isn't, this really isn't that, you know, that important Carver [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton] because this was promoted by the American Anti-Slavery Society."  And he, he considered it more propaganda than anything.  And so, he said these--you know it's not like you know it's not like Frederick Douglass you know who wrote his own narrative and I'm trying to think of the, the slave woman who wrote her own narrative.  And I think, I don't know Hen- I don't know if Henry Bid--Bibb [Henry Bibb] wrote his but I think--
Speaker 1: He wrote his, yeah.
Speaker 2: And Bibb wrote his, okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, the difference was that my great-grandfather didn't--when, when he escaped from slavery he didn't know how to read or write and it was against the law you know to read or write.  But he had innate intelligence.  He was a very bright guy. And he dictated his narrative to a member of the American Anti-Slavery Society, a pastor.  And so, he said, "Those dictated narratives aren't as you know aren't, aren't important at all and they are in the academic world aren't regarded as very significant."  It really disappointed me because I was really getting ginned up about my great-grandfather what an important man he was.  So, for, for years until I went down to Florida State [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida] and ran into this guy who worked at the--John Blassingame [John Wesley Blassingame] who wrote the Frederick Douglass papers for years I didn't think he was of import when it came to the movement.
Story_ID: 673103
Speaker 1: You had a story you wanted to tell about your mother [Virginia Clark Gayton].
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother, she was, she looked, she looked white.  But she was like my grandfather [John T. Gayton] on my dad's side would say, well she was a race person.  There was no one--she went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] you know, she--and her great, and her grandfather was you know, was Lewis Clarke who was you know fighting to bring down the institution of slavery.  And so, so, so she was out there.  And one time I, I related a story, there was a history teacher at Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] had said that you know he, he was bragging about the fact that his family owned slaves but he treated them very well and that there was one slave in particular, she had you know some kind of brain disease or whatever and he went through all the trouble to make sure that, that she went to the best you know brain surgeon in Canada and sent her up there to get, get you know cured of her brain problem.  And my mother got so hot when, you know when--she, she went right up and told this guy, she says, "The thing you need to realize that if his, if that slave owner's prize horse had gotten ill, he would have made sure that that prize horse you know was pure--was cured.  The fact is that that, that horse was property.  That slave was property.  They were not regarded as human beings.  You're, you're not getting the point as it relates you know to slavery," and that's the kind of thing that, that's the kind of thing that Lewis Clarke you know talked about, we're looked, we're looked upon as something less than human.
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear).
Speaker 2: And, and so when people say well you know we send them to--well they, they were treated very well.  They were treated very nice, well you know, free them you know.  Let--free them up if you want them to really be treated and to be able to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, there, there's, there's a whole discussion about the foundings of American Medical Association and the experimentation on black people who would be operated on instead of white people because an operation, in those days, were done without anesthesia and things can happen to you in the operations and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --were worse, worse than dying of the disease.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, I mean so it could have been a collusion to experiment on, on this woman to--I mean it could you know for money (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: But look at the, this, you know the syphilis you know program that they had, where was that, in Alabama or whatever, you know and it was--
Speaker 1: There's a whole history of that online, the American Medical Association.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In fact the founding president was a major experimenter on black people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in terms of doing operations without anesthesia, tying people down and doing things, discovering how the body works while you're still alive you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it wasn't possible to do that to white people but you could do it to slaves (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  Well anyway, I--this Dr. Pressly [Thomas J. Pressly] I was really disappointed in--'cause he had given me support and all that sort of business--when he did that, but then I started you know reading more about the, you know the new historians, many of whom are black who were saying those slave narratives are extremely important whether or not they were you know dictated.  But, but what, what kind of judgment is that you know just because you know if someone could read or write, I mean how does that diminish someone who went through something you know, you know some terrible you know kind of experience but they couldn't read or write.  I mean why would that story be less important since, you know because they didn't know how to read or write, you know?  So that, it just, the logic there you know didn't mean anything.  But that's--he said well it's not a, you know it's not a Frederick Douglass book.  It's, you know it's not you know the other kind of book that, where they had written you know themselves.  So, it gets into the you know that, well, well the, a discussion with regard to the, you know the Talented Tenth and, and--but I think W.E.B. Du Bois you know certainly had a different point than some folks were making because there's a tendency to think well (unclear) the talented tenth--that you, you are above you know, you know morally and every other you know and intellectually than you know than the, than others.  But it's, you know there's innate intelligence that we have to be you know thinking of too that, when it comes to these, these folks.  But--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause Du Bois was also indicating that this was--more is expected of you (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: That's right.  And you're--and the idea of, and which is forgotten about, the, the idea of bringing, bringing up those who are you know less fortunate than so many, so many ways.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and your executive capacity is greater--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because you went to school or what, you know--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --to do things that other people may not have the ability to do.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they haven't been trained.
Story_ID: 673104
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But the, but I guess your, your original point is tha- you know what do other families, we, we really have to do--I'll never forget going to something called a Talmud Torah.  There was a, a Jewish, I had a lot of, a lot of Jewish friends in grade school [Madrona School, Seattle, Washington], high school.  And so, they would go to school you know this Talmud Torah you know after school you know two or three days a week you know to learn about their history, not only their religion but to learn about their history.  And it's interesting this Talmud Torah building here in Seattle [Washington] which is right near Garfield [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington], it's turned into, it's a, it's a Muslim school you know now (laughter), you know.  That whole building is now owned by the Muslims.  I think, I think they're east, I think they're east, east African.  But, but those are the--we need to look at that kind of thing 'cause I, I'm in a group now where we give scholarships out to African Americans, okay.  And what's been happening lately, and African American male, males, that's the focus.  And what's been happening lately the, the young people from, you know who are maybe second-generation Eritreans or Ethiopians or Somalians, they're doing better in relation to these tests you know SATs and grade wise and all that sort of business you know than those you know young people who descended from, you know descended from slaves.  And so, there's--they even have at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] an affirmative action program within an affirmative action program to make sure that those kids who are descendants of slaves you know get a chance to get to some of these scholarships.  One of the reasons that I found out in talking with these young people you know from East Africa that, that have come over here, maybe they're the creme de la creme or whatever, I don't know.  But they know their history.  They know the history of their families.  They can go back thousands of years.  It's not just their religion.  And all these customs, all the history, they can talk about the kings and queens of their tribes and all that sort of business and that gives a sense of continuity and pride.  And we need some way or other, I don't know if it's the, you know, the family structures have been broken down or, or you know whatever but I don't think you know you, you need it traditionally but it's what happens within that structure I think is the important question.  But we need to be able to have that continuity about all these wonderful things that you know black folks have done.  My, my mother's uncle who she stayed with when she was going to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], he was a, an attorney, a patent attorney, graduated the top of his law class at Howard.  And he had, he was working for the U.S. patent office [U.S. Patent and Trademark Office] in the late 1800s.  And he came up with this documentation of all these outstanding blacks you know who have these invent- inventions that people had assumed were done by, by, by white folks for example and have all of this, this documentation about, about these wondering things.  And that, I don't think too many know about you know Henry Baker, that's who my, my, my mother's uncle was.  And that has all been codified and verified and so on.  But we need to be able to incorporate all those things within you know the curricula of these schools and it's not happening any--the changes have not taken place.
Story_ID: 673105
Speaker 1: I was teaching as a twenty-one year old at Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington], U.S. history class, and I would make sure that I incorporated into my U.S. history all the, the information that my mother had, that my mother [Virginia Clark Gayton] and father [John J. Gayton] had.  You know we had a small library, we had this book, you know we had you know, you know books you know and later George Washington Carver, W.E.B. Du Bois, you know all the traditional--Frederick Douglass and so on and so forth.  And I would incorporate that within the history of my classroom.  And then one day the head of the social studies department got in touch with me and she called me in and she said, "I just want to let you know, Carver [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton], that one of your students has been telling, telling me about what he called you know the, all the fairy tales about all that blacks had, had done in relation to you know to history, you know literature and you know and so on forth, so forth, inventions.  And, she--I just want to let you know, you know that this is, you know this is happening and this is what he told me."  And I said oh my god, I said what the heck you know--she says, but, but says, "I want you to continue to do what you're doing 'cause we don't have anybody within our department that is doing what you're doing to incorporate that in."  Her name was Louella Hart [ph.] never forget her name and she was the daughter of a, of a governor [Louis F. Hart] of the State of Washington back in the, I think the late, late '20s [1920s].  And she kept in touch with me for you know, another one who kept in touch with you know me for, for years.  But what she added before I left that discussion, left her room, I you know I kind of wiped my brow when she said keep on doing what you're doing.  She said, "By the way, that young man was So and So."  That was a young black man.  It was a black kid.  And so--
Speaker 2: So he couldn't believe what you were saying?
Speaker 1: He couldn't believe it.  He, he had gone through all you know schools here in, in Seattle [Washington], had all these teachers here and the, the thing that came to mind was the fact that you know obviously I wasn't you know angry at him but you know what a disservice you know the system has done to--and, and that's still the case that these young people don't, really don't have a, a good, a, a feeling of what, of what we've, what we've accomplished you know as a, as a people.  And it should be, it's got to--it--we are, you know we are the fabric of, part of the fabric of, of U.S. history.  U.S. history would not be what it is if it had not been for you know black folks and what their, you know--what they've contributed and what was involved.  I mean we got the whole Civil War, all that has changed the whole framework of, of what this country is about.  And we, that needs to be talked about.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Story_ID: 673106
Speaker 1: Now you were there, you were at Garfield for two years, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And while you were there, there were some important things that went, went on there.  I mean one thing that happened there was that Reverend Samuel McKinney who I've heard a lot about--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --invited Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] to Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you were able to meet Dr. Martin Luther King in 1961, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So, tell, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was unbelievable.  I--'cause I was--there was only two blacks in the social studies department and no--and one of only three that were teaching academic courses at the, at the quote unquote black school at Garfield.  And so Reverend McKinney who I had known from the time he had come into you know into town and to head the Mount Zion Baptist Church [Seattle, Washington], Martin Luther King could not speak, was not allowed to speak in any of the governmental entities or the major churches in, in Seattle because he was considered a radical.  People forget that.  I mean with the Nobel Prize [Nobel Peace Prize] or (unclear) think he was kind of, a (unclear) kind.  But he was considered a radical then.  He was not able to speak.  But the principal at Garfield High School [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington], Reverend McKinney was able to you know talk to him but I think he was supportive anyway to have him speak at Garfield.  And the fall--I had just come in that fall as a teacher and so Reverend McKinney said, "Would you like to meet you know Martin Luther, you know Martin Luther King?"  And I said of, of course.  And I sat in on--he gave two, two speeches that--'cause the auditorium wasn't big enough to hold--and he--I was just so fascinated because he gave these jewels or gems I should say unbeknown--without any notes and talking to the, the, the two class, two classes and it was just--I was mesmerized.  But, but the pastor said, "When you come back stage you know after the last presentation."  So, I went back there and so you--here, here we have me, Reverend McKinney and Martin Luther King backstage by ourselves and you know the--I, I keep thinking about it you know it, in this day and age, I mean everybody has an iPhone (laughter) you know to take pictures.  There was nobody to be seen in that backstage and so I, I--the one thing I really regret is the fact that that picture had not been taken.  But I, I think you know you stop and think I'm sure he had been getting you know death threats and so on coming up north.  I think he was more afraid of the North than he was the South for some reason.  But--
Speaker 1: So, so did the City of Seattle actually make public pronounce, pronouncements he's not welcome here or he's not (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I don't recall--I, I know that the, I'm, I'm sure Reverend McKinney you know made those statements that he was not allowed you know, he was not accepted.  In fact, it was years later First Presbyterian Church [Seattle First Presbyterian Church, Seattle, Washington] here in the city made a, this was a matter of a few years ago, made a public apology you know, that he, that he was rejected to go into the, one of the largest congregations here in Seattle, white congregations.
Speaker 1: Reverend McKinney was a pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --right here in the, in Seattle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And was that located in the Central District [Seattle, Washington]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, it was, you know my, my church, I was born and raised in, in the First A.M.E. Church [Seattle, Washington], African Methodist Episcopal church was the first black church and then Zion was the second.  And he, Reverend McKinney had been there for years.  He's still alive.  He's, he's well into his nineties now.
Speaker 1: Now you were, in 1961, John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] became, be, becomes the thirty-fifth president of the United States and this was important to the black community for a number of reasons.  How, how did that affect you?
Speaker 2: Well, it--I want to back up very quickly, real quick anecdote--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with regard--I, I shook hands with Martin Luther King and his hands were, were moist you know.  And he, he, he really didn't--it was a question about engagement or whatever and I often wonder you know what, you know was, you know whether or not he gotten a, a threat or whatever but he--the, the focus wasn't--and I was really you know, you know surprised how short he was and all that sort of business.  But it was a, it was a wonderful experience for me.  I often wondered what was going on you know in his life at that time because it wasn't--was it, was it right after or, or little bit before that he did have that attempt to be killed in Harlem [New York, New York] by a, by (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, his book, I think that did happen around '61 [1961] where--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a woman stabbed him with a pen--
Speaker 2: Pen, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the chest and it narrowly missed an artery, could have killed him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But anyway, that, that's, those are just the, the impressions I have.  I wished I'd had a, a photograph and I didn't.
Story_ID: 673107
Speaker 1: But now, '61 [1961]--
Speaker 2: The Kennedy administration (mumbles).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--to back up a little bit with regard to the assassination, I--my brother, we--family picnic, we'd go over to Seward Park [Seattle, Washington] and you know, with families sitting around.  And my brother was in the U.S. attorney's office you know appointed by Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy].
Speaker 2: So this is in '62 [1962], right, he's appointed in '62 [1962], and Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] president for a minute?  I mean it was after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was, was in, according to what I have.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who, Robert Kennedy?
Speaker 2: Your, your brother yeah, John C. Gayton, Jr. [sic.] was appointed assistant U.S. attorney general for the--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Gary Gayton--
Speaker 2: Oh Gary, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't John [John C. Gayton], yeah.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) okay.
Speaker 1: Gary Gayton, it was '62 [1962]?  Yeah, I guess that'd be right, yeah.  That'd be right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, '62 [1962], that--yeah, he was appointed.  Okay, so we're talking, this is, this had to have been about '62 [1962].  He says, "Carver [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton] you know--," and I hadn't, you know I had two kids [Cynthia Gayton and Carter Gayton] by then.  Here, I got married at twenty-one [years old], had two kids so, it didn't look like I was going to be leaving Seattle [Washington].  And he says you know, you know, you're going to be--I said you aren't going to be seeing the world at all you know.  You got, you'll be in (unclear) Seattle your whole life.  Said you ever thought about joining the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] 'cause I met FBI agents and, and you know, you know and so, you know it was real, really back in those days it was considered an honorable, very honorable thing to be in, in the bureau and all that sort of stuff.  And I said--I laughed at him.  I said I didn't, I didn't think that--I said I never even heard of a black FBI agent.  And--
Speaker 2: This is something.  So, you, you had never heard of a black FBI agent.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: And what was your impression of, of J. Edgar Hoover in those days?  Did you--?
Speaker 1: Well, it was--interestingly I think you know it's, it's a matter--the time in history is extremely important.  There are a lot of lawyers, there were a lot of lawyers, white lawyers especially because I didn't know of any you know, you know black guys that are doing it, in order to enhance their careers they would go into the bureau for two or three years and then go off into you know higher you know, you were maybe public office or go into business and you know that was regarded as a feather in the cap of, you know of a, of a young lawyer you know to have been in the, you know to have been in the bureau.  I mean you know he was, you know he, he probably was at his height of, of you know quote unquote you know admiration and all that other sort of business, Hoover was (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 673108
Speaker 1: I guess, I was a little younger than you but I--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --remember that there's a general feeling of awe and admiration for the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And J. Edgar Hoover seemed like a paragon of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the guardianship of right and wrong for the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you had you know which was a, a propaganda series was the, the FBI story ['The F.B.I.'] that was on TV, Efrem Zimbalist you know was back--
Speaker 1: Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so you know that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And you had 'The Untouchables' too, Eliot Ness.
Speaker 2: Well, 'The Untouchables,' that was a different, I don't know if that was the bureau but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the bureau [sic.], FBI, Eliot Ness was an FBI agent on the trail of Al Capone in Chicago [Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, any--yeah, I, I didn't--
Speaker 1: You didn't watch that one?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that one but I, I'm trying to recall whether or not that, you know that was the, the alcohol and you know part of the treasury department or whether--
Speaker 1: No, that's FBI and--
Speaker 2: It was FBI?
Speaker 1: --G Men and all that sort of thing, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the G Men were--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) films going back to way back in the '30s [1930s] I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The same as--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't, I didn't know, I didn't know of that one in particular.  But, but I knew of the FBI story and I knew of, I knew of Eliot Ness but there was--I had a question and I might be wrong that whether or not that was act--you know he reported directly to, to Hoover.  But anyway--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) he's FBI.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, out of Chicago (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, anyway, out of a, out of a dare, I didn't expect anything to happen, I applied and you know you had a--like I say the F, The FBI story was something 'cause that, that Eliot Ness and, that came, that was I think a few years after the, Zimbalist.
Speaker 1: No, actually it came out first, yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, that wasn't before the FBI story.
Speaker 1: I think so 'cause Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. was in '77 Sunset Strip' before he--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you check--okay, yeah you might want on check on that because, because the--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) wait, wait.
Speaker 2: Because I had a, I--we had a pitch that was made to us when I was going through my class--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And they said they, the story line and all that, that was--you had, you had FBI agents that were you know, you know determining you know what, what was good, what was bad, what was factual, what was not with regards to the whole script.  I can, I can speak to that one directly.
Speaker 1: Oh sure, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And that was okay, that was in '60 [1960], that was in '60, '63 [1963] 'cause I went in the bureau (unclear).  But I, I can't speak to Eliot Ness at all.  I, I just can't--but I, I can't speak to that one and the, and the popularity of, and the direct involvement of the bureau with regard to that show.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that's the primary point I want to make that there was a direct involvement that they had.  I can't, I can't speak to what involvement they had in the--
Speaker 1: 'Untouchables' and--
Speaker 2: --in 'The Untouchables.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, I, I, I think they were involved in that one too.  And in some--and he had been involved for years in promoting FBI as a, as, I mean the image of the FBI as the G Men and they used to do movie shorts you know in between films, things FBI, they showed J. Edgar Hoover with a Tommy gun--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) stuff like that and you know the FBI--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was de- had, had a media image--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --of being like strong, brave, fearless--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --guardians of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I, yeah, I can, yeah I can, I can, I can speak to that.
Speaker 1: Everybody, I mean I, I didn't know anybody that felt any other--I mean in the community.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, I guess the point that we're making and the point being is that the, the image of the FBI within the general public was fairly positive at that time in, in relation to black folks I don't think there was, you know it was probably I don't know indifferent in terms of law enforcement (laughter) in general or whatever.
Story_ID: 673109
Speaker 1: But you come into the, you, you act- you, you agree to join the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and--
Speaker 2: Well, I did, like I said I did it out of a dare.  But my brother [HistoryMaker Gary Gayton]--and I didn't really, I, quite frankly I didn't expect anything because they were you know, you know my understanding is that they bring in lawyers, they bring in lawyers and accountants.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so what was the process?  What, what, what happened?  How--what was the contact and how did you get processed and all that?
Speaker 2: Well, the--like I said my brother was--suggested it.  And so, what I did was I did, you know what I did was apply without having any sense of whether or not that in fact would you know I would get in.  And so, what, what, what happened was okay, I applied and then they said you know, you know they started doing the background investigation and so on and so forth.  And it took, I don't know how long it ordinarily took but it you know I almost forgot about it because you know I--the investigation is going on.  And, and most young people and young blacks you know my, my, my dad's [John J. Gayton] generation and stuff they were involved in a lot of groups in the '30s [1930s] that you know were, might you know have been recarded, regarded as you know friends with, concerning socialism or communism.  And there were a lot of things that they did, that the communists did that were kind of front organizations to try to encourage young people to you know to get involved and I think by, I think what happened in those days is the you know the bureau would collect lists of people who were signing up you know for these organizations who were going to these social, what they thought were social things.  And you know, my dad, my uncle and you know they were involved in those kinds of things and so I--there, there's quite you know may have been a possibility that they were real, there were concerns about me, those kinds of affiliations.  I really don't--I can't speak directly you know to that at all.  But it did take an extra amount of time because I, here I am probably the first black that the, well I was the first black that they were dealing with.  But after a number of months, months, I get my letter from Mr. Hoover [J. Edgar Hoover] saying that I'd been you know accepted into the bureau.  This is right around November, it was probably November of 1963.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I know for a fact there's no more than about, than three blacks that were in the bureau at that time.
Story_ID: 673110
Speaker 1: Now, this is--November of '63 [1963] is the month that John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you, well you're reading my mind.  I mean (laughter) so, a week later I get this letter from Mr. Hoover [J. Edgar Hoover] saying you know you're accepted and we want you to, you know to start off going to the [U.S.] Department of Justice you know for your first class in, in January.  And I, I think it was the first week in January for my first class on Pennsylvania Avenue there where the justice department before they had the Hoover building [J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D.C.].  And so, in the meantime, the assassination takes, what's that November 23rd [sic. November 22, 1963]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And I'm teaching a class at Garfield [James A. Garfield High School, Seattle, Washington] and I know there's a fire drill you know and those things happen and all that and we weren't--no one's--well, I wasn't listening to the radio but there was a--back in those days it was the first you know kids who you know had ear phones and they were--what do they call those things?  But they, he--
Speaker 1: Transistor radio.
Speaker 2: Yeah, transistor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, transistor.  And so, this young guys says the president's been shot, we're outside.  I'll never forget the sentiments.  And they said you know the president was shot you know and, and killed.  And I guess it struck those young people 'cause we came back in and you know I told them you know what had happened and I had a couple of classes and then you know that weekend it's amazing I remember the atmosphere.  I mean it, it was a sunny day here in Seattle [Washington] and then but the rest of that weekend it was, rain started coming.  It was really, I mean it was a, it was tough.  And I guess evidently those kids, you kind of felt that and I, I was invited fact, in fact just to that class, one class--the junior class was--anyway, they, I was invited just here within the last two years I was invited by that class you know for their reunion, I, I don't know was it fiftieth or sixtieth, whatever it is, fiftieth anniversary you know, to talk 'cause they remembered that day.  And I, you know they gave me you know they knew how much it impact on me and, and they gave me a recording of all the you know Kennedy speeches, I still got that and, and then beautiful notes and, and they knew at that time that I was going on to the, into the bureau and so, it was pretty emotional.  I, and I enjoyed the teaching you know a lot but I went on ahead and did that and so--
Story_ID: 673111
Speaker 1: In fact when I went back you know, and this, this is--'cause I was in the bureau [Federal Bureau of Investigation] for four years and it, it was like dog years.  I mean I, I could talk from now 'til the end of the, (laughter) end of the tape about my experiences (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: About them--huh.
Speaker 1: But, but I went back there that first day I'll never forget and the guy that spoke to our class welcoming us was a guy in a, you know, you know he looked traditional you know FBI suit and tie, had premature you know gray hair and just epitome of what an agent should look like and welcomed us.  And he was head of the instruction division of the bureau and it was a group of us, it was about twenty, twenty-four, three blacks in the group, me included.  And I'm finding out that that, you know here after all these years that the--it was Deep Throat, it was Mark Felt.
Speaker 2: Oh right (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, Mark Felt was talking to our class and then, and then later on I mean when I found out it was Mark Felt I mean, that's the last guy I--you know 'cause he was the epitome of--but, but he was, he, he was, was saying these things against Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] obviously.  He felt as though the bureau--'cause he had the admiration for the, you know for Hoover [J. Edgar Hoover] but what it's worth you know, but he had admiration for, well you know for Hoover and that's why he was speaking out against the, speaking out against Nixon.  But anyway I, I met him again, there was another class that I had in Quantico, Virginia after my--'cause I got--after my, the class I went to Kansas City which was the toughest, probably the toughest office--Kansas City, Missouri was a slaves, slave state.  And I was the first, first of all I was the first black you know to go into the bureau out of the State of Washington ever and then when I go, went to Kansas City I was the first black to go to Kansas City which included you know Missouri and Kansas.  That was the, the division.  And then, and then let me see, on top of that, I'm kind of like the, you know the, the first black to you know to serve in a slave state, former slave state.  They didn't put blacks into the southern, those southern states.  And so, here I am in Kansas City.  I was, I, I--looking back on it I think I was kind of like the canary in the coal mine you know to see you know if I survived there you know they could bring in other blacks.  And to--yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So, this is what '64 [1964] by now?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're g- we're at--'64 [1964].
Story_ID: 673112
Speaker 1: Now I got a question first--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --before we get you--
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: --talking about what happened in Kansas City [Missouri].  Di- how did, did, did, did the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] mention or how did they mention race in your training?  Was it mentioned at all or, or, or--and if they, they did mention it how did they mention it?  Because here we're in the height of the Civil Rights Movement.  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is in, he's demonstrating in the South in Birmingham [Alabama] by now in '63 [1963].  Things are hot and heavy down there, Bull Connor, all those is going on.  And there have been movies made.  There was a movie made called 'Mississippi Burning' where you have--
Speaker 2: Well, that was way after, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but way after the fact.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But the perception now is the FBI--
Speaker 2: I could tell you directly about that.
Speaker 1: After the movie they had the FBI played by Gene Hackman and another actor [Willem Defoe] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: --going into there and defending the civil rights workers.
Speaker 2: I can, I can tell you about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right.  That's, that's why I'm asking now.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, what did they mention in, in your training and then what actually did you observe was going on (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Okay, let me, let me back up a little bit--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --'cause my training that, that lasted you know it was in, in Washington, D.C. and in Quantico [Virginia], okay.  And there, there was like I said three blacks in my class.  One of them, I'm trying to remember his name (unclear) but he was in the finals you know after Hoover [J. Edgar Hoover] died he was the one of the finalists you know to take Hoover's, Hoover's place in '72 [1972], whatever.  But, but he was a former, he was a, he was a brother that was down there in Alabama.  He was working for the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] then before he went in the--and he was down there when you know governor what's his name from Ala--
Speaker 1: Wallace, yeah.
Speaker 2: Wallace (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: George Corley Wallace [George Wallace].
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was part of that, that contingent that was trying to bring in the, you know, students into the, into the school down there.  And so, he, you know he relayed that.  But I--we became you know pretty good friends.  In fact, they came out here a, a while ago.  He became the sheriff of what is it Wayne County [Michigan] in, in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I, I wish--I can't, my--I can't remember his name right offhand.  But anyway what, what happened in, in the class during the classes were there, we're--there were--and not a lot of specific things at all that I can recall about race.  We did, you know just to give you a little bit of background, we did have, when it came to the assassination, we had the team of people who were examining the Oswald [Lee Harvey Oswald] rifle.  They were, when I was in Quantico they were practicing on that same Oswald rifle to see whether or not he, that bolt action, he could squeeze off the number of bullets that he had to you know try to determine whether or not that was possible.  So, they, they gave--and I don't remember all the specifics of the discussion but the, the end of the discussion when, when it came to the issue of you know the number of bullet holes were in the shirt of the president [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and all that other sort of business whether or not they were extra bullets and all that and what they, what they, what they concluded was that, was, that Oswald you know did it you know by himself, that that was the, what the, the firearms experts you know had, had concluded.  But just the fact that they were there and I was watching them practice on that, it was you know, I, I didn't realize as the, you know the, really part of history here I am a young twenty-four year old you know watching all this stuff.  So, but the interesting thing was after the--and there were no, as far as I knew, I--and I don't know where the information came from at the time but there, the only--up 'til this time (unclear) I think there were three before my class, blacks and then afterwards.  But the blacks that were so-called agents and there were blacks who drove Mr. Hoover's car basically what it boiled down you know to when he would you know have you know some special events you know like that in Los Angeles [California] or Miami [Florida] or, or whatever.  But no real official you know special agents for the FBI.
Story_ID: 673113
Speaker 1: Now, did you actually meet J. Edgar Hoover at any time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --during your--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (Laughter) He was--yeah, I did meet him for, for, for our graduation.  In fact, before the graduation we're told you know you have to wear you know the dark suits and white shirt and, and make sure you have a you know a hat and all that and I told--
Speaker 1: With the snap down brim and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so I told my class president, my, my class director or whatever, I said I'd never worn a hat in my life and he says, "Gayton [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton], the director wants you to have a hat you know," and so (laughter), and so I had the hat and, and then he said, "Don't say anything, don't say anything to Mr. Hoover when you, when you go through the line and shake his hand, you know, don't say anything yet to him, just keep you know, said nod your head and keep moving."  But I, I, I, evidently I, yeah I didn't get the memo or something and I says, "So how are you?"  He said, and then he did a double take (laughter).  And so--but that's the thing I remember.  I remember he's you know, a short man and so on, but, but you know it was quite a deal you know obviously to meet the, meet the director.  And I think one thing that needs to be said about Hoover was he was a product of his times.  He was in that office [Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)] since the '20s [1920s].  And you stop and think of the people who were running the agencies at that time when it came to their mindset with regard to how they saw blacks and so on and so forth.  They probably you know, he--rather than him being an exception, I think he was pretty much a reflection of the, of the fabric of government as a, as a whole on how they saw blacks and race and that sort of thing which wasn't--you know they certainly weren't liberal (laughter) you know by, by any means.
Story_ID: 673114
Speaker 1: So, anyway, but I got a--it was interesting and I didn't realize it until later when I got assigned to go to Kansas City, I was the only black.  And I, I was surprised to talk, I was talking to a couple of the--there was a guy named Kelley [Clarence M. Kelley] who ultimately became the head of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  He was the chief of police in Kansas City then.  And I was talking to a couple of people I was introduced around, they said well they had a dossier on me (laughter).  They already knew about me you know.  I mean the place, I mean and so I was a little bit you know concerned you know about that.  But me, I don't know.  But I thought that was all in house but these guys, these, a couple of these policemen I talked to, they said they knew about me and then, and we had, yeah, we had a whole outline.  I was a little bit uneasy you know about that.  But you had two different police departments.  You had Kansas, Kansas City, Missouri, Kelley ran a pretty tight ship and was regarded as a, as a you know, pretty good you know police department.  Kansas City, Kansas though on the other hand, I mean it was kind of a, (laughter) that was a, that was another world.  I felt like I was in a kind of western outpost over there 'cause I walked in this guy, he was a--it was a black guy's office, what was his name?  Bot- yeah, it--his name was something like Boston Stevens [ph.] or whatever and he had, when you walk into his office up, up above there was a, a rub, red hose you know and underneath it says lie detector (laughter).  I mean, so that was my introduction. And the, the, this Boston Stevens were the--and I may not have his right name but he, and he had a, he had a gun, the barrel was about you know two feet long and that, and so, I really felt like I was kind of a throwback in time in Kansas City, Kansas.  But that was, anyway, that's another world.  But, but you talk about you know civil rights, there were no, I didn't know of any agents and I didn't, I didn't stop and think with Kansas City you know Missouri that it was a southern state, but in fact, I mean that it was a slave, slave state, but then you know it was a slave state.  And I--no other blacks in the Deep South were agents and no agent, no blacks you know had you know did security cases.  And, I--you know, the cases that I had both in Kansas City and in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] were, you know I, you know I, we were kind of the tough guy squad.  We you know handled bank robberies and fugitives.  Those were the kinds of cases I handled in Kansas City.
Story_ID: 673115
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, the implication of what you're saying is that though the federal government deployed people to sites all over the United States and I'm sure there were few black in the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] period, but you say none in the South deployed?
Speaker 2: None in the South.  Well then not--
Speaker 1: So they were bending to the will of the southern--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.
Speaker 1: --local government.
Speaker 2: I'll elaborate on that.  One, one of the things that Hoover [J. Edgar Hoover] did, he really depended, the way the system was set up, he depended on close relationships with the police departments.  And so, you know in the South you know you're going to have a, you know you're going to have a clue what the police departments were you know, were like and then you had the close relationship of the agents and I'll, I'll speak further you know with regard to that you know in, in just, in just a second.  But I was--so, that's where I was.  And, and I knew, there's one guy I'm still in contact with.  He was an attorney from Iowa.  He's an All-American basketball player.  But he wanted to go and he only stayed in the bureau a, a year because he wanted to work security cases and that related to the civil rights issues and all that.  And so, he you know he didn't want to do the criminal cases and the criminal cases were the, kind of the bread and butter for the budget of the bureau you know pretty much because you know--'cause I was working, I also worked interstate transportation, stolen motor vehicles.  I still remember the number, number twenty-six cases.  And, and you know, you're--you had to work with the, the locals you know to get these cars that they go and you know, across state lines and all that other you know sort of business.  So, they had to you know depend on those close working relationships.  But the--and then when I was, when I was there I would have guys what I call baiters.  There was one guy in particular who would bait me about--he said, "Well Carver [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton] why they, why the black folks you know eat so much you know greasy food," (laughter) you know something like that.  And you know, and so I would, I would handle questions like that, like they were rational and I said, 'Well," I said, "Joe you know, you, aren't you from, aren't you from West Virginia?"  I'm--I--he say yeah.  "I'm sure you had colored folks you know, giving you--preparing food for you, I mean so, you know maybe you can tell me something" (laughter).  You don't know.  But I don't, but, but ultimately there was a good friend I had who was a, who was an attorney from University of Pennsylvania Law School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I haven't, I, I haven't talked to him in a few years but he found, he knew about what this guy you know was doing and so ultimately what happened the word got around in the, in the group quite frankly and they sent him out to a, a single agent outpost out in you know western Kansas.  They put him out 'cause he was, he was pretty flagrant.
Story_ID: 673116
Speaker 1: And that, but then I'd have a guy as an example, these are just the instances I had and he would say, "Well Gayton [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton] I just want to let you know I've never talked to a first office agent [of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)] before and I'm, I'm, but I'm talking to you because you know, you're different or something.  But I just want to let you know that that's the way I, that's the way I operate.  But, but I'm giving--," in essence what he's saying, I'm just giving you a privilege that I'm talking to you because I ordinarily don't talk to first--but I, you know you could generalize you know what he was saying.  But then you know you had instances where there was a Jewish guy in the office and you know you have to sign in, out of you know the government documents you know, and the--and Mr. Hoover [J. Edgar Hoover] wanted to make, you know they want people to work beyond the average of you know of two hours overtime (laughter).  And so invariably when you have something like that people when they sign in, they're going to you know they're, they're going to fudge, there's a tendency to fudge you know to, in order to get that two hours average (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Kind of exaggerate the time that you--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they exaggerate the time (laughter).  But there was this one guy, I mean he was a Jewish, a Jewish guy, he was a fairly new agent and he would, he came in and he saw where the time, that the, the guy before him was, was not the actual time and so he went and you know, he started signing in you know to you know make sure he was, had more time than the guy before him but it was, it was the wrong time.  And so, this guy started sending letters to Mr. Hoover about some things that were going on (laughter) and so what they did I mean this is what happens in government but I remember this case in particular.  And so, he'd send in letters without talking to you know his superior or anything and so they said--and they got a little bit tired of that and so they, they, I think they, they booted him out for forging you know a government document because he was fudging on those times.  But those are the, those are some of the things that happened.  But Kansas City [Missouri] was considered a, a disciplinary office in that--and, and this goes on to another matter.  There's so many things you know to, to talk about here.  But it was a disciplinary office and so there was a guy for example who was an heir of a, a radio manufacturing company.  I forget you know which, which one it was.  But he had, you know his family was you know, making money.  He loved you know, the work.  And so, they'd have to call him up to, to cash his checks you know.  But he, reason why he was in Kansas City is because he was, I think in Chicago [Illinois] and he was off you know to catch a you know, catch a fugitive and he was going to the Chicago airport, O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois] or whatever and you know there's a policeman, Chicago policeman stopping him because he, 'cause he was speeding.  He was trying to get this fugitive.  And so, he cussed out the policeman (laughter) and said, "I got to get this guy.  You know if you want to get me, you're going to have to catch me," so he goes on to pick up the fugitive.  But, so they would--because of the relationship with the police department, so on and so forth, they disciplined him to go to, to go to Kansas City because Kansas City I think, I think it was some place in Alaska and in Butte, Montana.  Those were the kind of what they call--
Speaker 2: The, the places nobody wanted to be in.
Speaker 1: Well, but the interesting things, you have some really, you had, you had an interesting mix.  You have some real dedicated guys you know who did like this guy did you know who, who just wanted to get his fugitive and then but he aggravated the, you know the, the, the political base there in, in, in, in Chicago.  But, so you had that kind of mix of folks there.
Story_ID: 673117
Speaker 1: I want to get back to the civil rights issue you mentioned, then I'll get on this other one.  But in '64 [1964], that's when we got our, you know with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of '64 [Civil Rights Act of 1964], we got our instructions you know how--or, or broadly what the bureau's guidelines were with regard to en, you know enforcing the Civil Rights Act of sixty--of '64 [1964].  And--
Speaker 2: So, what did you do differently in '64 [1964] that you didn't do before in terms of (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Well, it, it didn't affect me you know.  It didn't--you know what we're talking about is cases that related to violations of the law.  And my case, it didn't impact me 'cause I was handling fugitive bank robbery and, and you know stolen motor vehicle you know types of things.  So, it didn't, it, it didn't impact me.  So, but anyway, I remember, I still got a copy of that thing you know that came out that went to, you know went to all the, went to all the agents.  But then, but then we had the assassination and there was a fellow who was transferred.  In fact, he was on my squad for--he was in the Dallas [Texas] thing--there was a question and then all of this is, all of this is on the internet.  I'm not saying anything that's any different than that's there.  But he had a, you know a, a, a security case open on--his name was Jim Hosty [James P. Hosty].  He had a case opened on Oswald [Lee Harvey Oswald] because he had, I guess there had been information that he was, you know of his relationship with the Soviets and Cuba and that sort of thing.  But he, but he came, he was disciplined out of Dallas you know to come to, to come to Seattle [Washington] and, and what I, you know what I gathered and which was, it's been confirmed in all the documents and that is that he had attempted to reach Oswald but couldn't, couldn't get directly in, in touch with him.  And so--but because of the fact this fellow had killed the president [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], this agent had this case opened, couldn't get in touch with him that left a--and I, I'm generalizing here, that left a question about you know, what should the bureau [Federal Bureau of Investigation] have done and all that sort of business you know, to be more forceful.  Anyway he, he get--and so, that was an embarrassment.  And, if it--then, it didn't have to be any, any major issue but if there was an embarrassment to the bureau.  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay, embarrassing having contact with Oswald before the assassination and not have him secured (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yeah, he had not contacted him, trying to contact but he had the, you know the case open.  And so, the story--and one of the other things that the bureau required if you're working security cases or if you're working criminal cases they wanted you to at least have a couple of informants.  And so, the, so there was often times you know you would have closed cases that were opened up in order to meet this requirement of the minimum of informants who, who were going to give you information about you know some cases that you had.  And so, that, that happened with Hosty.  So, he's, he, he's all through--in fact I was interviewed by a couple of assassination committees over my relationship with--the fact he and I were on the same squad.  But you know, what, what this does when it comes to history and so on, it's amazing you know how all these things start to connect.  And so, but anyway, that was his situation.
Story_ID: 673118
Speaker 1: So, we had that and then the other one was and this relates more directly to civil rights which, it gave me a sense of pride for what the bureau had done and that one relates to you mentioned you know the burning, what 'Mississippi Burning' movie.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, you had the, the situation in, in, in Mississippi and was it Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Mississippi?  What was, what was the town?  I'm trying to think of it.
Speaker 2: In the movie I'm not sure but Philadelphia is one of the towns (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was Philadelphia, Mississippi where you had these civil rights you know the three civil rights workers that were assassinated.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, big case.  Schwerner [Michael Schwerner]--
Speaker 2: Goodman [Andrew Goodman] and Chaney [James Chaney].
Speaker 1: --Goodman, Chaney, okay.  And, what happened was, and a lot of it had to do with the new Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964], they--
Speaker 2: Yes, the spring of '64 [1964], yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --when they were--
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm in Kansas City [Missouri] at the time.  So, what they did they sent down, I think it was about a hundred agents from different parts of the country to go in there, they could not use, would not use the agents that were already down there in Mississippi because of the close relationship that the agents there had with the local and you knew they weren't going to in- you know, really investigate the case in a way it should have been.  And so, my friend you know, I had a couple of friends I mean they were, the fellow from the University of Pennsylvania Law School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], a real good man, he was tabbed to go down there.  There was another fellow for--all East Coast guys.  One guy that I worked, was one of my partners and got moved, in fact a case I should have been on.  But he, he was from New York City [New York, New York], former cop New York City, a sharp lawyer too.  So, he was tabbed to go down and another fellow from New York, another attorney, they were among the hundred that went down there to investigate that case.  And it was the first case that you know, for that kind of you know assassination atrocity that was solved you know by the, by anybody.  And I was proud of the fact that that happened.
Speaker 2: Do you remember the circumstances?  I mean the drama of it because it--?
Speaker 1: Well, the drama of it, in fact it was so horrendous for my buddy from Chicago [Illinois] that he, you know he had ulcers and, and he had to come back you know in a stretcher, you know, ill.  He got ill you know going through all that down there.  So, he had to come back (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: 'Cause the search lasted all summer and while the search was going on you had Freedom Summer going on in Mississippi with, SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] was down there--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --registering voters.  And which--they would get up the end of the summer and go to the Democratic National Convention [1964 Democratic National Convention] in Atlantic City [New Jersey] I think it was.  And as they arrived is when the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] found the, the bodies.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well they--but then the investigation took place and they didn't use--but they did have informants you know down there and you know there's a big question about the use of informants and all that sort of business.
Story_ID: 673119
Speaker 1: But the, yeah, but you know fast forward just a couple years ago, there was a, a group of young people who were investigating getting background on Civil Rights Movement in Seattle [Washington] and they talked to you know Reverend McKinney [Samuel McKinney], talked to you know [HistoryMaker] Larry Gossett who was a Black Panther [Black Panther Party] who was on my--when I--I'm going forward.  And he--when I was running for school board [of Seattle Public Schools], Larry Gossett was on my, on my committee you know to get the office.  And I had--he covered the left and I had a, you know a guy headed a lumber company on the right (laughter).  We canceled out everybody in between.  But anyway he, he was on my committee.  But there was, there, the three of us that were recognized by this group of young students who were, who wanted to find out about civil rights.  They were from Franklin High School [Seattle, Washington] and, Franklin High School and Mercer Island High School [Mercer Island, Washington].  It's a, you know, a very wealthy area.  And, and I told them you know when I was involved.  I, you know I was involved in you know what I did in the bureau [Federal Bureau of Investigation], what I did at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] and so on, but I don't, I never regard myself as a you know as a civil rights activist if you're black, you know in--what was it, and Fannie Lou Hamer said if, you know you, you can't say you, you don't want to be in the mess, you're born in the mess you know.  So, (laughter) you know, so I've been involved as a black person in a lot of different things.  So, but anyway they interviewed me for my civil rights and some of the things that I got involved in that, that you know I had a connection to civil rights and lo and behold they give me a call and they said you're going to be recognized you know by this group of students who were, wanted to find out more about the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964] and, and they came up with, they came up with, with me, Larry Gossett who you know he's on my, my, my--my son [Chandler Gayton] is working with him as a--you know as a cabinet aide you know.
Speaker 2: The county commissioner.
Speaker 1: For the county [King County, Washington], yeah.  So, anyway--and then a lady by the name of Schwerner.  And I said, my god.  And I said, "Wait, wait a minute."  I said, the only Schwerner you know I know of is Schwerner, Goodman [Andrew Goodman] you know situation down there--
Speaker 2: Chaney [James Chaney], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Chaney and you know down there in Philadelphia, Mississippi.  They said, well that's the lady.  She's an attorney and she was down there with her husband you know trying to register, register blacks to vote.  And she was obviously was not killed but she came up here as an attorney up here in, in Seattle.
Speaker 2: So, this is Mickey Schwerner's [Michael Schwerner]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yep.
Speaker 2: --mother.
Speaker 1: Wife.
Speaker 2: Wife, okay.
Speaker 1: And so, I'm up there and I'm getting this recognition by these you know here you have a guy who was ensconced you know as a Black Panther you know in the Civil Rights Movement.  You have this Schwerner whose husband gave his life you know for, for that and you know for the movement.  Then they have me and then I you know, I, you know I, I took a stand on a number of issues that relate to the Civil Rights Movement I guess, but I was not as--and I, I said, I, I, quite frankly I said I--these people surrounding me, I said I have a hard time you know accepting this you know this recognizing.  I think I have a little trophy over here or whatever.  But--because I know what they, you know I know what, what Larry had gone through and I know what Mrs. Schwerner [Rita Schwerner Bender] had gone through and those are you know real, real you know civil rights heroes and put their, really put their lives on the line you know with regard to it.

Speaker 1: So, but it was just, it just brought back memories of that time in Kansas City [Missouri] and the you know the agents that I knew that went down there you know to, you know to resolve that thing.  But one thing that they, one thing that they did, regardless of all the, you know the, you know the, the negatives when it comes to civil rights, when it comes to Hoover [J. Edgar Hoover], he, he set up you know a system you know by way of informants similar to what he did with the Communist Party, you know.  He had the (laughter), he had folks that were working as informants within those cells of the (unclear), did the same thing with the Ku Klux Klan [KKK].
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  There's a, there's a book by a fellow named Gary [Gary Thomas Howe] somebody called 'My Undercover Years With--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the FBI' [sic. 'My Undercover Years with the Ku Klux Klan'].  And he--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I, 'cause I had an experience.  To give you an example, I had experienced in--'cause some, yeah 'cause my--I was sitting right next to folks they were doing espionage cases you know for the bureau in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And so, they were, and I was sitting down with him.  He's like come on, come on with us.  And these guys had these, about three or four guys sitting around and they were, they had all this information about these communist cell log, they had logs of what was taking place.  And this one guy, they were talking about the same cell.  Okay, there's, let's say you're about five and so this one guy would say, reading this one log say, this guy is saying--this other fellow he's the real dyed in the wool you know communist.  This is a guy that's really bad.  Then you have another one pointing you know to this other fellow who said this other guy is a bad one and they say he's really the bad one.  What happened, he--they had infiltrated these cells you know so deeply, everybody in the cell was on the payroll of the--
Speaker 2: FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 673121
Speaker 1: We were talking off camera about the murder of Viola Liuzzo and, and a fellow's got a book out ['My Undercover Years with the Ku Klux Klan,' Gary Thomas Howe] where he says he was an FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] informant in the Klan [Ku Klux Klan (KKK)] and actually informed the Klan about it before it happened.  But nothing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I can't, I, I can only speak in terms of third person with regard to that.  But, but it was my clear understanding that there was a, in solving that murder, there was an agent--there, there--not an agent, an informant, a paid informant who, or revealed who was involved in, in that, in that murder, in that assassination.  And all those (cough), those two things that happened in Philadelphia, Mississippi, this Liuzzo--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Viola Liuzzo.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was all, that all followed you know the, the--after the passage of the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964], the fact that the bureau got more involved.  But I had an interesting experience in--when it came to that sort of thing 'cause they--here I was the only black agent in all of Kansas City [Missouri].  I was only there a year and a half or something like that.  Then I get transferred.  I wonder--they said where do you want to go, you know?  Your office of preference.  I said, well Los Angeles [California], San Francisco [California] or Seattle [Washington] so they sent me to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] naturally.  And so, that's why (laughter) so I was far away from Seattle.  And in some, in some ways it was probably pretty, probably for my safety or whatever you know to be there.
Story_ID: 673122
Speaker 1: But anyway, I was, yeah, I--so I went to, so I went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] you know afterwards but I'm trying to remember you know exactly the, you know the case that relates you know very much to that same one.  But I, I lost my train of thought with regard to that so I'll come, I'll come back to that.
Speaker 2: Oh, with the Vi- the Viola (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the, yeah the--
Speaker 2: --Liuzzo [Viola Liuzzo] murder--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--
Speaker 2: --in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Oh, well one of the things was the, in relation to that, informants I guess that's what it was (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There were people, it's, interestingly since I was the only black agent, 'cause I'd get into--I could not go into the, the jungle of Philadelphia or the CD [central district] of Kansas City [Missouri] you know with any of my colleagues you know.  I, you know I was already you know identify, you know wear, wearing my black suit and white shirt and all that other sort of stuff.  So, I always went by myself.  And you know, you're young.  You know, you know you think you're you know, your, nothing's going to happen to you but I always made it a point to do that.  But I, I was able to you know to--in, in fact it was an enlightening thing in that I, you know I usually, you know prior to going to the bureau I think of folks being black or, or issues being black and white and, and right and wrong and--but I found out I just, some unbelievable, unbelievable people that I met in terms of if they had another, came along at a different time in their, their lives, they could, they would have been doing so many other things, just brilliant people and people who had you know they had you know, you know a little bit different codes of honor and so, and so.  I, you know I wasn't naive.  I, I knew that you know I was going into dangerous territory.  But, but I, but one thing I you know learned is showing--even if people are doing wrong you respect them as human beings.  And I--that's what I tried to do the, you know the whole time and I tried to do that in my whole professional life and that is to you know listen to these, to these folks.  And I, I just found out some unbelievable people.  There was one guy that I, I was working with.  He was so proud that you know he had met a, a, a black FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] agent.  You know he was able, you know he was a small time you know quote unquote criminal whatever.  But he was starting to introduce me to all sorts of people around.  He was so proud.  He said, "I'd never met a black--," I mean he, he had worked with Bugsy Siegel (laughter) you know the guy who, who started you know Las Vegas [Nevada] you know for, you know with the mob and so on.  And he was driving these bootleg alcohol you know trucks between L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and, and, and, and Mexico.  And he showed me--and I, you know I--but, but he was a bright guy, came from Detroit [Michigan], worked as a contractor in Kansas City among other things that were on the fringe.  He showed me his rings.  Said, "This is what Bugsy Siegel gave me."  He said he was there you know before, right when Bugsy Siegel was quote, unquote whacked and that sort of thing.  So, he had, he was really ensconced with that.  And there was a, there's a real strong La Casa, La Cosa Nostra connection there in Kansas City.  And you know he was on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah that's--I've, I've seen it in movies in, in reference to, in books--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --'cause I was going to ask you about that if it--was it really true.  They--
Speaker 1: Well, I, I can't, I can't--
Speaker 2: These are old Italian guys.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and when it came to the--it all, I think it all emerged you know from the you know, the, you know the bootleg liquor, the Prohibition Act [Prohibition Act of 1919] you know that connection between Kansas City, Chicago [Illinois] and New York [New York] and so on.  And, and that's where the syndicate--and you stop and think your Baby Nelson [Baby Face Nelson], Machine Gun Kelly, you know and you could go on, Bobby--Bonnie [Bonnie Parker] and Clyde [Clyde Barrow], they all came from that area.  I, I felt, I felt more at ease when it came to you know my, endangering my life in Philadelphia than I did in Kansas City because they tended to be you know part of the whole western kind of a cowboy you know mentality.  I mean every one of these guys are wearing you know had guns you know in the back of their belts and all that other sort of thing.  So, I--you know you never knew what the heck was going to happen there.  But, but the, the black--this was what I found out.  The--you know and I would go to affairs for you know with the black elite you know the Negroatte [ph.] and, and they found out that I was in the bureau, they'd have, they'd have some question you know what's this guy all about and all that.  But I, when I went into the, when I went into the, you know, the central districts, when I went into the, you know the jungle of Philadelphia I mean the, there was a real admiration.  You see people--you, you go into their, into their rooms in their apartment houses and stuff because--and I never saw poverty like I saw in, in Philadelphia for example. You know they'd have a picture of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and, up there and, and, and Kennedy.  Some of them you know we're talking about years ago, they might even have Roosevelt's [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] picture.  But they--in these you know just regular black folk's homes you know they had you know, you know they had that belief you know in the, you know in the system that I, I can't speak you know more--
Speaker 2: Yeah you're right, I mean everybody, every--it's almost like a, a mime that everybody's grandmother in those days had the Kennedy brothers [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy] and--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --Dr. King on the wall or Jesus.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: You know.
Story_ID: 673123
Speaker 1: So this guy, he was really helping me you know, you know want to assist me, wanted to introduce me to, to--in fact, there was one time he was working with one guy who was a, he was a distributor you know for the liquor.  I forget which whiskey company or, or maybe had been even a beer company in you know central part of Kansas City [Missouri] and I knew this guy, small world.  I mean I knew him from Seattle [Washington], this guy was doing the same thing.  But he said--so we got together you know for, this is just kind of an incident and we got together and you know, you know I think maybe lunch something like that and the guy started deride, you know deriding me, said, "Man I could, I know people who could you know, you know we could get you on a, you know on a list and take care of you if we had to," this and that you know start, you know kind of big or veiled threats and that sort of thing.  And--but my, my buddy Cal [ph.] he said, "Hey, I've got this man you know is an FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] agent.  He's a guest you know of, of mine and I don't want you, I don't want you talking to him you know like that," and so on.  I mean it was, he would straighten them, he'd straighten them out.  And, and he put his life on the line because you know the word would get around to the police departments that you know that me--you know Cal is talking to this, this guy and this guy is a you know a fed and all that.  And he had, he was set up for some burglaries.  He had the wires on his car cut and you know stuff like that, that would happen that were all, also veiled threats to his life.  But I met just some brilliant people.  He--Cal certainly was one of them and then another--every once in a while I'd have to go out with a fellow who would you know had to interview folks that were connected with La Cosa Nostra and he had to have someone else with him so they'd ask, he'd ask me to come out.  And what is it the, I'm trying to think of the, you know it wasn't Italian but he would, he would--
Speaker 2: Sicilian?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Sicilian?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  So, he, he would listen to these telephone conversations 'cause he, he was Sicilian and so that, that's the, the, you know the upper levels of the Cosa Nostra, they only connect you know through Sicilian, okay.  So, he went out and talked with me.  I talked to this one fellow who ran, a black guy who ran the floating crap games and he wasn't interested in the floating crap games, he--you know because that, that was local you know.  He was interested in because of the connection, he couldn't have run those floating crap games unless it was connected with the mob you know.  Yeah, he wouldn't have gotten the okay you know to do it. But he'd sit up there and talk about how he ran you know--he, it was a performer thing.  He knew he wasn't going to get any information from his guy about his connection with the--but he had to do it because he, they knew he'd only be able to operate there without the connection with him, okay.  So, but he starts talking about the crap games and this guy, his mind is such and when he run, he said, "I never go into a crap game unless I have a sense of how I'm going to come out, how I'm, you know if I'm going to win or lose or whatever."  But in his head he would you know after watching the games you know for a while, he by probabilities, he would determine you know, this, this is beyond me, he'd determine when he was going to either pull out of a game or, or to go into a game.  He had a mathematical mind that was just unbelievable.  And he said he had a--and, and then he start talking about his kids.  He had two kids who, one was going to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and another one to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] you know working on Ph.Ds., they're both math majors and, and that sort of thing.  But that, those are the kinds of things that I was exposed to.  And this guy had been doing that since the '30s [1930s].  And it was just fascinating (unclear) that--and then I, I'm just talking about a relatively short time I was in Kansas City.
Story_ID: 673124
Speaker 1: I was you know doing a lead and [HistoryMaker] George Haley was running, running for office in Kansas City, Kansas you know.  It would have been the first time a you know, black was a, a senator in Kansas City, Kansas you know since the, since the Reconstruction (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: This is Alex Haley's--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: --brother, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Alex--yeah.
Speaker 1: So, but I you know, I didn't, but, but I didn't know all about that because neither book had come out yet.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, George called, he said, "Carver [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton]," he says, "Gosh you know," again you get this reaction, "I didn't know we had a black agent here in, in town."  Said, "Come on, I'm--come over to the house you know and we're going to have dinner."  And so, my wife at that time went over and had dinner.  He said, "Carver you know my, my brother's coming in, in, in town here soon.  I want you to meet him.  And he is you know he's coming off the--you know he's a freelance writer.  He's a freelance writer and he's coming to town.  He's going to, he's going to talk to an aunt who has some information about our family you know, okay."  So, so what happens we get in there so he starts talking about well yeah--and you know how you get and you talk with somebody and they say things, you say well, is this really the case or, or is this true?  And then he says, "Well my, yeah my, I, yeah I'm going to talk to this aunt who has this connection with Africa and all that sort of stuff," and he says, "Plus I'm having a book ['The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' Malcolm X with Alex Haley] that's coming out in relation to you know Malcolm X you know here," and you know and I think that was '65 [1965] or something when that came out (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the year that Malcolm was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm saying well isn't that nice, you know.  And I'm just eating dinner and--but next thing you know you know those two books come out and I maintained contact with George you know over the--but then Alex you know he comes back here.  In fact I have a picture right over, right over there when he came back to live in Seattle [Washington] and my, my son [Chandler Gayton] at the time, the one that's twenty-six, god that's a long time ago, but he died after about two years he was here in Seattle.  But he saw--we went to--didn't know either one of them 'cause they're going to this Christ- this reception, wedding reception.  So, he sees, he seems me and then, then he sees my son, we're carrying him.  He was a year old all right, and he said, "Let me have the, let me get that baby."  So, he--and he, he does that Kunta Kinte thing.  He got a, we got a picture.
Speaker 2: Holding the baby up?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's right over there.  And so, he's like (laughter).  I said oh man this is, this is really something.
Speaker 2: I had no idea.  You know I didn't realize that Alex Haley lived in, and actually died here in--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in Seattle--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --'cause I, I found out the other day I, I didn't really realize that August Wilson had lived here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.  And another guy I, I met and known and he, we did some connections with the museum, the Northwest African American Museum [Seattle, Washington] and so on.  But those kinds of incidents I mean you know you travel around the country, you're one of the few black professionals around and, and you, you know when you find out how few there are in view of the communications system you know that, that's there.  And, but that was then.  And George, George came out here, we had a national conference the Sigma Pi Phi [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity], reconnected with George and just a really, really fine family.  But, but anyway those were the kinds of things that--you know just a few of the things when I was in the, in the bureau [Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)] that I connected with (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 673125
Speaker 1: I left the bureau--
Speaker 2: In, what, '67 [1967] I think?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '67 [1967] I left the bureau, I--because I was recruited--oh, I got to tell you first--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --they were going to try to make me a kind of a poster boy you know for the bureau and so they had me go over to Booker T. Washington High School in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to talk with a group of students or black--well that was practically all-black school anyway, yeah, to talk with them about you know been--and they, these kids were just, gosh a black FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] agent.  You know that was the kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --reception I got you know.  And so, then they asked, "You know why did, how did you get into you know, why did you go in the bureau?"  And I said, well it was a big push on the part--and I got a picture of Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] that he signed you know--I met him very quickly in, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] when I was going through classes there.  And he, I, I said well the reason you know why there's black agents in the bureau is probably you know because of Robert Kennedy as attorney general wanted to increase the number of blacks in, in the bureau and that was a, you know a primary reason.  But that, but there was a guy from Mississippi that was with me, the PR [public relations] guy and so when we left he says, "Robert Kennedy you know wasn't you know the one, it was Mr. Hoover you know was the, was the one that, that brought it--it wasn't--," 'cause they, obviously you know Robert didn't get along you know that well with--but they were in cahoots you know, they--not cahoots, but a lot of these things that went on with regard to the wiretapping and all that, you had to have the approval of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had to work--
Speaker 1: --of the attorney--
Speaker 2: --together on some level but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they, it was kind of known that they didn't like each other that much.
Speaker 1: No, yeah.
Speaker 2: He--now did you ever hear a rumor that J. Edgar Hoover was actually black or--?
Speaker 1: Oh, I, I, I didn't--I, I vaguely remember that and you know the rumor about him being homosexual--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's another one (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --that was, you know that was another one.  But I read you know some authoritative accounts saying that that was you know probably, probably an exaggeration.  But the interesting thing is when it comes to those, those kinds of things, a lot of this stuff came out after he died.  I mean you stop and think that man you know how many presidents did he serve under, you know from, from the 1920s, 'til when he died in office in 1972?  And it, you know you stop and think you said, well they had--he had something on all these people.  That's why, the reason why all these things you know went on.  But it, it, it certainly doesn't say much about those individuals, some of whom I had a great deal of admiration for who would be you know cowed you know by, you know this man you know unless they, you know unless they you know had, you know liked him in office or wanted him in office or, or whatever.  But, but it, but the, the thing and you know I don't think it does you know a service to the, you know to the, and to anybody you know when you wait you know--why wait 'til they die you know when he can't (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, the, there's one thing--
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: --that, that people (unclear) it was documented pretty closely after he--and that was this tension and this, with the Civil Rights Movement and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And there, there's a, I mean they, the FBI as far as I, I know it's been well documented sent like recorded Dr. King--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and sent these tapes to his wife and other things but Dr. King did not stop what he was doing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think those things are true and, and there's no question about his you know his perspective as the case, you know as it relates you know the blacks.  You know he was, he did discriminate and he, he certainly you know had this personal feeling you know toward doctor--I don't think there's any question about that.  I actually heard about the, the tapes you know way before they came public.
Speaker 2: When you, when you were at the bureau?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I had, it was just a, you know the word you know got around.  I didn't, I didn't, had no, I didn't have any direct relationship to him but I, I think it's important to note with regard to you know, you know some of those tapes if, if not most of them that they had, had to have been approved by Robert Kennedy.
Story_ID: 673126
Speaker 1: Now was there a tension between the--well I know there was, there was a tension between the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] on some level as such.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But the- in terms of civil rights activity, I know that there's a--it's been written that in Alabama when George Wallace stood in front of the door--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], Nicholas Katzenbach came up confronted him with a U.S. Marshals quote.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know and a lot of these guys are just guys who worked in the justice department doing all kind of things, accountants or whatever.  They--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they put an arm band on them and send them out there to look like it's a big force of the U.S. Marshals [U.S. Marshals Service]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know ready to act.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know, did you have a, did, did you ever discuss that kind of thing (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I didn't, one, there's one real I was going to mention to you, he decided to leave, he--'cause he could not work and, and I'm sure there are others, that he was not allowed to work in, in security cases, that he just quit.  And I'm still in contact you know with him, who is the black, James--tried to get in University of Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi]?
Speaker 1: James Meredith.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Meredith yeah.  I was in Bobby Kennedy's [Robert F. Kennedy] office when I was meeting you know him and he had the U.S. Marshals hats with the, with the dents in them and a bunch of you know stuff with this, kids made--and then there was a first, first coin that was of, of President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] that was minted and you know had a little of all that, all of that stuff.  But, but the Katzenbach thing, I didn't, I didn't have any in depth knowledge of that but I, I, I could--the only thing I can relate to is the, the situation and the, you know where you had the Marshals helmets with the, you know they were, they were really attacking you know them, you know with clubs and all, and with nets and helmets and all that sort of business.  But one thing you, you mention, Katzenbach, every once in a while they would have agents had the responsibility to, to handle phone calls.  I don't know what they do now but phone calls on the weekends to handle you know complaints or calls that were coming in.  And one thing that really stuck with me, it relates to the stuff that's going on now in that you'd have these just crazies calling up you know saying they were going to assassinate Katz- I remember one in particular said they're, they called him Katzenbacher [ph.], you know.  And all, the threats and, and how you know there were--you know I knew there were some, you know some arsenals that were being raided.  The word didn't get out.  They would take weapons and you know, that wasn't getting out to them.  But I was getting these phone--
Speaker 1: White supremacists who had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --developed an arsenal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they were threatening the federal agents.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so the question that came up, I said, god you know this is something you know the general public doesn't hear about.  I said this is really a dangerous country, I said. So, the surprise I guess over, you know looking back on those years of why you know why more stuff hadn't happened?  I mean, be- because I remember those phone calls that I would get you know just as--and, just in a few instances when I had that responsibility to answer and having these, these really demented people out there and why--
Story_ID: 673127
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now did you have any, any stories about the assassination of Malcolm X or Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?  And you know, having been--you, you left just before Dr. King was assassinated in the bureau [Federal Bureau of Investigation], right?  But you were there when--no, you weren't assigned to you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I had--well it's interesting you mention that.  I mean I, I enjoy--some of the most enjoyable conversations I had because I, it's usually--it was indirect where I would talk to the head of the mosque you know of Elijah Muhammad.
Speaker 1: In, in Kansas City [Missouri] or--?
Speaker 2: In, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Philadelphia, okay.
Speaker 2: And, had wonderful conversations.  I said, again this is where, we talk about black history and you know the movement you know and be--I wasn't investigating any sort--I may have been investigating somebody who was doing some criminal charge but I wasn't interested in them in terms of what they were doing with regard to the movement or anything of that sort.  But it related directly to a criminal case, that I was investigating.  But I, but we'd go on to other conversations which I enjoyed a lot--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and again it showed the brilliance of some of these guys that if they had another opportunity what they would have been able to contribute to you know in a broader society.  There was a guy I became fairly close with, another brilliant guy who ran, he--it was a family thing.  He ran the numbers of South, South [South Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and his father before him, his father before him.  And he never had to use, never had to use--
Speaker 1: Pencil or paper?
Speaker 2: --pencil or paper.  Never had to use pencil or paper.  It was all in his head.  And it was just fascinating you know listening to--and, and then there was, you know it became, it became kind of scary beyond that.  There was a lady I was talking to on some issues and she just so happened to find some you know, see something was going on between I don't think it was this gentleman but it was somebody--well, may have been.  But you know passage of a conversation between you know from the, the license on the car and this, this fellow involved and so the license on the car went directly to La Cosa Nostra or something.  So, the numbers wouldn't be able to operate in South Philly back in those days unless they had been a connection.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, they had to have you know some kind of connection.  But--and I, I--not because of the situation but that this lady that got this information I had you know, you know passed this information on to you know the folks that I thought you know were the ones that had the connection with the intelligence division.  I think it was Rizzo who was police chief at the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Frank Rizzo.
Speaker 2: Frank Rizzo.  And next thing I know, and I don't know where the source was but I, I, I had already gotten interviewed by Lockheed Missiles and Space [Lockheed Missiles and Space Company] and run their--not--you know to be part of their security you know operation, a security rep you know for them working NRA [sic.] stuff--not NRA, NSA, National Security Administration stuff.  So that's what I, after I left the bureau that's where I went, was Sunnyvale, California.  But anyway, what happened right be- and I didn't know all that transpired but this lady that gave the information, next I know she calls me up, and I'd get these calls you know the middle of the night say, says, "Agent Gayton [HistoryMaker Carver Gayton], you got to get me outta here, my whole apartment has been ransacked, torn up, you know.  This is a message you know to me you know and I need to get, I need to get out of here."  And so, I had to--so somebody is either the Rizzo police department or my guy in, in the bureau that you know that fingered her.  And, and her life was in danger so I had to quickly you know get her somewhere else.  And, and, and I, I liked this guy that was, I was talking to, the numbers guy and I talked to him and I said that, I said, "I just need to you know find out you know what the heck is going on."  He said, "I thought we were--," and these are difficult things.  He said, I, he says, "I thought we're fam-," I said, "Yeah well, I mean you know, I respect (unclear) but I got, I got to ask these questions."  And he said, "Well Carver," he says, "if I'm not out of here in an hour, my lawyer is going to you know, going to be here," but I don't know what happened afterwards.  I said, oh, okay but they--so--but I was, you know I handled bank robbery and fugitive cases.  You know evidently I crossed you know with this other information that came through.  I mean those are the kinds of things you got to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was a bunch of situations like that.
Story_ID: 673128
Speaker 1: And then, and then the riots.  I mean I had, god I was in--the riots and one of my guys you know came in you know--
Speaker 2: Where, where in?
Speaker 1: In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Philadelphia, okay.
Speaker 1: You know, sixty- '65 [1965], '66 [sic. 1964] in that area and my guy came in with a, you know with a, you know 'cause you had these posts, these police posts you know down where the riots were taking place and, and I think it was in, either in West Philly [West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or South Philly [South Philadelphia, Philadelphia Pennsylvania], whatever and he said, he's shaking and he, he said they're going to pour the, they were going to pour this cyanide in the, in the coffee canisters, you know the police.  So, he brought in you know brought his, and so he saved, basically saved lives this guy I was working with.  Everybody thought he was, he was crazy you know 'cause he, he, he'd walk around with a Polaroid camera with Bermuda shorts and long socks and, and he was listening to everybody that was, he was listening to everybody that was going on and you know, and, and when it came to you know criminal activities and stuff.  And so, I--
Speaker 2: So you're able to stop this from (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was, but he was able to stop that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, but I, but I asked him you know just between two brothers.  I asked--I said, "How do you feel about," you know, I'm, you know I'm, I'm arresting you know blacks and you know probably with fugitive cases, probably the majority not.  I asked him, "How do you feel about you know arresting these folks?"  And he says, he says, "Well you know I don't, I don't give everything.  You know I don't--there are some things I know and some things I, I don't," so he makes a, a distinction you know between what he is going to relate, what, what's not going to relate to the authorities and that kind of thing.  But the, but he had, he (laughter), he was something.  He, he had a family, I mean and, and I never experienced this in the west in Seattle [Washington].  But he had a family in North Philly [North Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in the jungle and had family in West Philly.  Thing is, I you know, you, you--in those days I assure, I'm pretty sure it's the same way now, you, you couldn't go in between those neighborhoods.  I mean it was dangerous.  So, he, for years he had one family--
Speaker 2: And they never saw each other (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And never saw each other.  I mean this guy was, you know that--those are the kind of characters you know, individuals you meet in that, in that work and it was, it was, it was fascinating, fascinating stuff but I learned a lot (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And why did you say--?
Story_ID: 673129
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why did you say you left the bureau now?  For--
Speaker 2: Well, I, my wife wanted, at the time you know wanted to get back to the West Coast and this.  So, what happened my old--the, the guy that was my, head of my class he said this fellow wanted to--you know heard about me and I don't know how he heard about me, but he wanted--there was a position open in Lockheed [Lockheed Missiles and Space Company] working NSA [National Security Administration] stuff.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.  I just wanted to--'cause we, we've got to stop here but I just wanted to make sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--and so, and that, that one, because--and where we're going is right near where my wife's sister lived and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and more money and, and, and it was fasc- it's, it was more, in many respects more hairy than what I was doing in the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].
