MJ: Talking about just the community dynamics of playing with a group, I&#8217;d kind  of like to talk about the folk revival tours, the--  AG: Oh, yeah (laughs)  MJ: --Southern Folk Cultural Revival Project.  AG: Yeah, somebody should write a damn book about this. I swear to god, --  MJ: Absolutely!  AG: --it&#8217;s pretty amazing. There was somebody who was doing something  because I remember doing an interview with her quite a while ago&#8212;a long time ago. I  don&#8217;t know what ever became of that. Maybe she just, I don&#8217;t know. Maybe it&#8217;s just a  book or thesis or what but yeah, somebody should do it.  MJ: There&#8217;s a lot--a huge file on it in the Folklife Collection with lots of really  interesting pieces of correspondence and--(AG murmurs, indicating interest). So I  ALICE GERRARD  2  understand, well, could you tell me a little bit about what your thoughts are of the  purpose behind getting that tour organized?  AG: Well, I didn&#8217;t organize it. I mean, it was Anne Romaine and Bernice Reagon  were the--and Anne has told me about this and I just can&#8217;t remember the specific details.  But Anne was living in Atlanta at the time. She&#8217;s from Gastonia, North Carolina and she  was living in Atlanta. She was very active--she and her husband Howard Romaine were  very active-- in the civil rights movement.  And there was a--and Atlanta was a hub of activity--that&#8217;s where The Great  Speckled Bird newspaper was and headquartered. And I believe, I can&#8217;t remember if  Bernice Reagon was living there at the time or if she just had--was coming through or  something, but she and Anne were friends and they sat down and talked about the idea of  possibly doing something that would speak to people&#8217;s struggles, in the South, using  traditional music as a vehicle and going around the South. Which at that time was a very  novel idea because at that point there was you know, there were lots of venues up North,  like the Newport Folk Festival, and the Friends of Old Time Music in New York City  just--Philadelphia and different places and you know, Southern--traditional Southern  musicians--were being presented at concerts and festivals up North but it was like the  South--it was still too close to the bone, kind of. I mean, people didn&#8217;t really appreciate  their music that much and you know, the kids who were--the next generation of kids were  kind of going through rock and roll and there was-- It just wasn&#8217;t known or particularly  appreciated in its home communities, so much. And, so their thought was to create a tour  that would go around and present the music and just kind of by, you know, just by having  somebody like Roscoe Holcomb get up there and sing and talk about his life as a coal  ALICE GERRARD  3  miner and the problems he had living in Daisy, Kentucky where strip mines had ruined  the water that he had to use in his house and one thing and another and this would, it  would speak to people.  And so they started these tours and they got a few people like, I think Pete Seeger  might have gone along on one of the early tours for a couple of concerts just to kind of  get the ball rolling and I don&#8217;t remember who the first people &#8211;the very first people were  but it wasn&#8217;t too long before they asked Hazel and me, or Anne met us and asked us if we  would be on the tours.  And so that was kind of, that was probably nineteen--either the late sixties or  early seventies. I swear I&#8217;m really bad with those kind of details (MJ laughs) but they  probably have something about it down there.  MJ: Okay.  AG: And it&#8212;we, Hazel and I you know, we just kind of we were into bluegrass  music and we&#8217;d been playing a band around D.C. mostly and when Anne asked us to go  on the tours, we realized--you know she couldn&#8217;t afford to hire a whole band so it was  just Hazel and me so we had to put together something really quickly that would just be  representative of what the two of us would do, you know. I could also play the autoharp  so, and Hazel played the bass and she could play guitar a little bit so--you know, we just  worked out material that we could do with banjo and guitar, two guitars or autoharp and  guitar or some unaccompanied things. And we did this recording which was the first  recording we did for Rounder Records of the two of us and it&#8217;s kind of the classic Alice  and Hazel record that people know about--and it was the first one with the little gray  picture of us in the middle.  ALICE GERRARD  4  We--you know, neither of us were--we grew up, I&#8217;d say that I grew up in sort of a  middle-class household which tended to be liberal in its political point of view. My  mother certainly was. And, so I, you know, that was kind of in my consciousness at any  rate but I didn&#8217;t consider myself a political person at that point, particularly.  Hazel I don&#8217;t think was at that time consciously political but you know, she was  who she was. She grew up in a large family of poor, you know, they were poor people,  grew up in the South and some of her family were coal miners and they moved to  Baltimore like so many other people did during the Second World War to get jobs in the  factories there and it was a very hard life. And that was her experience. But I feel like,  you know, at the risk of speaking for her&#8212;I don&#8217;t want to speak for her&#8212;but I believe  this to be true, that it was the tours that really sort of made us more politically conscious.  Because Anne was extremely political and she--we&#8217;d go into--we did one tour in the  mountain South and another tour in the deep South and everywhere we went--You know,  a lot of the stuff that we did was like if somebody was having a strike we would go do a  concert in that community. The background was always political. Even if it wasn&#8217;t  overtly political it was political because we were talking about strip mining. We&#8217;re  talking about people whose, like Roscoe Holcomb who could not--If he went away and  played music and made money, they would take away his, his, what do you call it? (long  pause)  MJ: Contract?  AG: No, they&#8217;d take away his, not his pension, but he got welfare. They&#8217;d cut into  his welfare check because if he made any extra money doing anything and he was barely  surviving as it was, you know his back was broken, and disability and it was just, you  ALICE GERRARD  5  know. There were all these people who, you know, and on the tour like there was Roscoe  Holcomb, Bessie Jones, Mabel Hillary, Johnny Shines, Ola Belle Reed, Hazel and  myself, the Balfa Brothers,--I&#8217;m trying to think--Dock Boggs, Elizabeth Cotten. It, yeah,  it was just an amazing array of people you know and it would be--Nimrod Workman--and  it would be a lot of the same people from--but there&#8217;d be usually different ones too, so  there was a mixture of the same people and new people on different tours. So you&#8217;d be,  you know, you&#8217;d be rattling around in this van over these little mountain roads (laughs)  and it was very hard scrabble. And it was always, you know one of the big things is the  tour was totally integrated, you know. And that was a big--that was--it had to be both  black and white musicians on every tour, and you know, we were very conscious, you  know we were in the South and we&#8217;d go into a restaurant and you know, we made sure  that we were sitting not with all black musicians at one end of the table, and all--We&#8217;d  mix it up and it was a very conscious thing that we were into. And, so, and I feel like that  was kind of when--and also we started writing songs--that was when we started writing  songs was during that time. Well, writing songs and actually performing them.  MJ: Because prior to the tour you were just, you were performing songs that you  learned from other musicians?  AG: Yeah, primarily. And it really, you know--our consciousness was definitely  getting raised, you know. We were seeing things, or I was seeing things for sure and  Hazel nothing was very foreign to her because she&#8217;d grown up in that hard scrabble. But I  was seeing a lot of stuff in the South that I had never really seen before.  NEAR END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A (456)  ALICE GERRARD  6  MJ: It&#8217;s really interesting what you&#8217;re saying about what was going on within the  group &#8217;cause my first question when I learned that the tours were interracial, or started  reading more about them, was how the communities received the tours, the communities  were&#8212;it was a Southern tour, right?  AG: Yeah.  MJ: So what were your experiences in different places?  AG: Generally, they were really good. You know, we played a lot of different  places. We played in little community centers, we played at college&#8212;in college  auditoriums, and I would say--I&#8217;m trying to remember. I mean, I think, you know, it&#8217;s  really too bad Anne is still not with us. She could--Because I don&#8217;t remember any&#8212;Oh, I  do remember. I think in general experiences were really positive. And we had, you know,  I mean, I have a couple of really strong memories of like Reverend Pearly Brown, who  was a blind street singer from Americus, Georgia, and he--we went up into Blacky,  Kentucky. And we did a little concert at the community center there and then the next  day we sat around where the general store was, and we were staying in the&#8212;the guy who  owned the general store, we were staying in his&#8212;We didn&#8217;t stay in hotels a lot, we stayed  mostly with people who put us up. And were staying at the guy&#8217;s, his name was Cobble,  staying at his, in his house. And then we just kind of --we didn&#8217;t have anywhere to go the  next day so we were just kind of hanging around town and we went down to the general  store and Reverend Brown was there. And he was just playing music and people were  gathered round and you know, I have a picture of Dock Boggs in this little community  center with all these young kids kind of sitting around watching him. And we stopped one  time &#8211;it was Reverend Pearly Brown and a black steel--national steel guitar player--  ALICE GERRARD  7  named Babe Stovall and we stopped at the Union Grove Fiddler&#8217;s Convention which was  at that time it was just before it kind of fell apart because all these motorcycle gangs  would come and tear things up and--I&#8217;m sure it was a totally racist scene down there but  Babe saw that.  You know, I think the thing was, if you started playing music that&#8217;s all sometimes  people need. You know, I remember talking with--and he&#8217;s a black guy and this is a  totally white scene but he was playing his guitar and people loved that. You know? And,  so I think that music really does cross a lot of boundaries.  On the other hand, I--we were somewhere. I don&#8217;t know if it was Savannah, or  Charleston. I think it might have been Savannah. But the van had broken down and we  were getting it fixed. And we had to lay over there. And so Anne and I, and Anne was  this very petite beautiful long blonde hair big blue eyes kind of you know, heavy  Southern accent--She and I went looking for a place we could get something to eat. And  we walked, saw this&#8212;we were just kind of wandering down the street&#8212;we saw this it  looked like a bar but it was open and we walked in and there's nobody there. The guy  behind the counter, we asked him if we could get some sandwiches and he said &#8220;sure.&#8221; So  we sat down in a booth to wait for him to make the sandwiches and Johnny Shines, who  was a black blues singer who was also on the tour, happened to come past the same place  and we saw him and we called and asked him to come in, &#8220;Hey Johnny&#8221; (whispers).  He walked in and the bar guy&#8212;the guy making our sandwiches&#8212;came out from  behind the bar and he said &#8220;You know, I&#8217;ll make ya&#8217;ll some sandwiches but he&#8217;s gonna  have to take him out.&#8221; And Anne--I couldn&#8217;t believe this. She got up in his face and she  says, &#8220;Listen&#8221;--this little blonde thing&#8212;and I&#8217;m sure he was totally freaked. And he was  ALICE GERRARD  8  this big (gestures to make a wide frame). She got up and she said &#8220;You son of a bitch.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;That&#8217;s against the law and I&#8217;ll have your&#8212;I&#8217;ll have the FBI on your ass so fast  you won&#8217;t know&#8221;&#8212;And she was shaking her finger in his face like this (both laughing)  and he was you know took, he stumbled back. He went through the door and got a broom  and came out like this with a broom like he was gonna hit her. He didn&#8217;t. He wouldn&#8217;t  have I&#8217;m sure but it was like, he was, it was very threatening. And at that point Johnny  said, &#8220;Well come on, let&#8217;s just go.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t want to have a big to-do. So we did, we  left. But she did call the FBI and--but they sent the State Bureau, so big deal. And I don&#8217;t  know what they--if they ever did anything about it, but--(laughs). They came over at the  motel and talked to us about it. But that was quite, that was, there were occasional things  like that but there was never, nothing that I remember while we were doing the shows.  And not, I mean every now and then traveling, you know going into a restaurant and  stuff, you could kind of feel the looks, you know, but I don&#8217;t remember anything overt.  And--&#8217;Course I&#8217;m talking as a white person, you know. Maybe some of the black people  felt it.  NEAR BEGINNING OF TAPE 1, SIDE B (607)  MJ: From my understanding, you and Hazel chose songs that kind of represented  the voice of working class Southerners.  AG: Yeah. We definitely did. Because the point of view of the&#8212;that was the  point of view of the tour. And so it was entertainment but it was also speaking to, you  know, trying to raise the consciousness of whoever was listening to us too. Or, in the case  of, if we were, you know, playing for the striking miner&#8217;s dinner of Harlan County or  ALICE GERRARD  9  whatever, we, you know--They didn&#8217;t want to hear a love song, they wanted to hear a&#8212;  &#8216;grrr&#8217;&#8212;a song about what they were going through. And so, that was really part of the  whole thing.  MJ: And ya&#8217;ll started writing music on that tour?  AG: We did.  MJ: What were those songs like?  AG: Well, Hazel had written--I&#8217;m trying to remember if this is before she went on  the tour or sometime during the tour. She wrote this great song called &#8220;Black Lung.&#8221;  &#8217;Cause one of her brothers had died of Black Lung. And she--it was just this incredible  song. I&#8217;ll never forget the first time she sang it. Just kind of, it was, like really knocked  me over, it was so beautiful. And, you know, her-- I feel like with her it just kind of  brought out something that was in her kind of right close to the surface anyway and it just  this tour and Anne&#8217;s support just kind of gave her permission to go for it.  And so she, you know, we didn&#8217;t do--and we did songs like the Carter Family&#8217;s  &#8220;Coal Miner&#8217;s Blues.&#8221; And we did, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m trying to think--let&#8217;s see--I wrote a  song called the &#8220;Custom-Made Woman Blues&#8221; which we did a lot and so, we were I  guess we were kind of gearing some of the things we wrote to the tour. And becoming  more conscious of, you know, why are we singing this song about some idiot who  murdered his wife (MJ laughs), or what, but then you know then we--you could also look  at it a different way which is that those sort of things happened a lot, you know. And  that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s so many songs about it. It happened a lot, and it shouldn&#8217;t be  happening anymore and you can, you know, so you need to talk about that. So it was just  kind of because all these, you know, traditional music comes out of people&#8217;s lives. It&#8217;s  ALICE GERRARD  10  not just pulled out of the sky somewhere. It, you know&#8212;and a lot of song comes from  somebody&#8217;s experience, generally speaking. I mean, there are the people who sit in the  boxes in Nashville and write consciously write, try to craft a song a day. But in general  great songs that have been written just come from people&#8217;s experiences and people&#8217;s  lives. And that&#8217;s what traditional music is all about.  NEAR END OF TAPE 1, SIDE B (672)  MJ: I love music because I feel like it can have so many different meanings, or  mean so many different things for different people, and with your kind of, woman&#8212;the  term I would like to use, and I&#8217;m not sure this is cool with you, but the term &#8216;woman &#8211;  centered,&#8217; like some of the music--the songs that you write, &#8220;Mary Johnson&#8221; for example.  When I hear that I&#8217;m like, &#8216;hell yeah!&#8217; (AG laughs). And I know--I know that a lot of  young women identify with, with the music that you write. Would you--How do you see  your music fitting into like the feminist movement, for example?  AG: Well (laughs). I have to say, I mean I think--Let me see if I can--I feel like  neither Hazel--You know what I said at the concert about being at this, this event. I think  it was some kind of event around a strike, here in&#8212;might have been Winston-Salem,  North Carolina. But I wasn&#8217;t living here at the time. And we were sort of, we are all  staying at the motel. And hanging around the pool. It wasn&#8217;t the tour. It was before we  started going on the tour. I can&#8217;t remember even why I was there. But I was there. And  this woman came back from&#8212;and she was all excited, and she was part of the (__?) and  she says, &#8220;I&#8217;ve just been to this great concert,&#8221; she says. A lecture, or something, on  women&#8217;s liberation. I said, &#8220;Women&#8217;s liberation, what&#8217;s that?&#8221; You know? And it was  ALICE GERRARD  11  kind of like, and she was trying to explain it to me and all this kind of stuff and I--It  didn&#8217;t really mean a whole lot to me at the time. I mean, I--I think that I didn&#8217;t have &#8211;  Hazel had a lot of experiences as a woman playing music in the bluegrass scene that she  was in around Baltimore. Because it was totally a man scene back then. I mean there  were so few&#8212;you could count the women on one hand it was--and, and they weren&#8217;t  respected. They were just kind of like, &#8216;oh, you know.&#8217; And she was, you know, she was  a chick bass player and they might let her get up and sing one song and you know, while  she&#8217;s playing&#8212;and that was her experience until she met people who didn&#8217;t treat her like  this.  And then when we started singing together, you know, it was a whole different  story. I never had that experience. I never had--I always felt very supported in what, the  music that I wanted to do. And when I was learning how to play, I never sort of felt like it  was something I shouldn&#8217;t do, or &#8216;why are you trying to play the banjo,&#8217; you know, &#8216;or  the fiddle,&#8217; or--You know, I just felt like I was supported. And then I--when I lived in  Washington DC which is where I met Hazel, when I met her she lived in Baltimore  which is really, you know--I was married at the time, my husband and we had friends  who played music and there were a lot of guys and they were all kind of, sort of similarly  middle class, you know. At least high school graduates if not college. And I never got  that vibe from any of them that I shouldn&#8217;t be doing--you know, they were very  supportive. And so, I had a somewhat different experience from Hazel.  But I still could identify with, I mean I still, I mean I could see what was going on  around me. And I knew how women were dealt with and to some extent, you know, that  happened in my relationships too. I mean I think that---Because it was just a given, you  ALICE GERRARD  12  know. That basically you were responsible for the kids, and you were responsible for the  meals, and I didn&#8217;t really think too much about it. But as I became more conscious of  some of the inequities of this system, it you know, I was more aware. And, at the same  time, both Hazel and I, you know, we worked a lot with men, you know, in bands and  one thing and another, and there was this one time (laughs) we were hired to play at this--  some women&#8217;s thing in New York. And we got there and it was like, they weren&#8217;t even  letting men in the room. And Hazel, I think she was really shocked, you know, and I  think it was a heavy lesbian scene, and she&#8212;We just didn&#8217;t realize it, you know, and we  got up there and we did our thing and they were &#8220;yeah, yeah,&#8221; they loved it and but they  had, they had people there at the door keeping men from coming in. And I think she, I  remember--we were a little upset about this at the time because it was like, what if we  had--what if we hired our friend Joe (MJ laughs) to come play banjo with us or  something, you know. How would we have dealt with that?  And, you know, but that was early on and I realize now--I think there&#8217;s, there are  places for that, I mean I think that some people just feel more comfortable if there aren&#8217;t  men around. I mean, one of the things I like about having an all-girl band is that there  aren&#8217;t any guys in it and it&#8217;s really fun (laughs). It&#8217;s different, you know. And so, and  there&#8217;s something kind of neat about it, you know. You spend a lot of time talking about  what you&#8217;re going to wear on the stage and you know, this kind of stuff. And it&#8217;s just,  they--the guys-- wouldn&#8217;t understand, you know. But, Tom and Brad, they understand,  but (laughs), the next best thing to girls.  So, I think we&#8212;we just were kind of na&#239;ve, we were pretty na&#239;ve, in the early  days. And we got more educated as time went on. And I think, you know, I think things  ALICE GERRARD  13  have really progressed, and, I don&#8217;t know--where were we in this conversation  (laughing)? I forget what you asked me.  MJ: Well, the idea of being a woman in a--a woman performer in a--  AG: Yeah  MJ: --a field that&#8217;s, well especially in that time dominated by male performers  and&#8212;  AG: Well, and it still is. And it&#8217;s dominated, although there are so many more  women in the field now than there used to be. And I think old time music is more maledominated  in this day and time. Than in some ways I think bluegrass music has come  further in that sense. I mean, a lot of women, a lot more women in bluegrass music.  Although it&#8217;s still heavily male. But compared to what it was when Hazel and I started  doing it, my god. I mean, there&#8217;s just no comparison. You have some great women  musicians. And you have some in old time music too, but I think it is more male  dominated. I mean, women generally play support roles. And you know, I don&#8217;t really--I  can&#8217;t really say I have a problem with that, I mean I take a lot of pride in being a really  good rhythm guitar player. And I&#8212;but I also make sure that I have places where I can  play fiddle too, and be the lead player.  And so, you just have to, you have to--I think sometimes--and the more women  that are doing this, the easier it&#8217;s gonna be, because it&#8217;s, you know, there&#8217;s just a bigger  support system out there. Sometimes I think&#8212;sometimes I think that women just have to,  especially women, you know, in their, like, forties and fifties because they grew up when  it wasn&#8217;t quite so easy to be the lead player, as opposed to Ola Belle Reed who, only the  leading role will do (laughs). But I mean, so women are used to being the guitar and the  ALICE GERRARD  14  bass player and the support player. If they want to be something else, sometimes it&#8217;s  harder I think to, I think, to kind of do that battle. With yourself, as well as with whoever  else.
