Jane Lancaster: [00:00] Beatrice W. Miller. Tell me what the W stands for.

Beatrice Wattman Miller: My maiden name—Wattman. W-A-T-T-M-A-N.

JL: So it's Beatrice Wattman—

BWM: Miller.

JL: Miller. And what class were you?

BWM: Nineteen thirty-five.

JL: Wow.

BWM: A long time ago. Doesn't seem that long.

JL: So you were at Brown—at Pembroke during the Depression.

BWM: Yes.

JL: What effects did it have, do you think? What—

1

BWM: What?

JL: Did you notice the effects of the Depression while you were at college?

BWM: Well, you know, when I was teaching school, other teachers had a unit on the Depression.
So they said, "Oh, you lived through it; you can tell us all about it." But thank goodness, my dad
had everything straightened out and I knew nothing about it.

JL: Really.

BWM: Even though I was old enough [01:00] to understand it. But he—everything was taken
care of.

JL: What did your dad do? What was your father's job?

BWM: He was a jewelry—a costume jewelry manufacturer, and a very brilliant man.

JL: Which company was it?

BWM: Oh, it was W and W Jewelry, and we called it Work and Worry. (laughter) But he was
also in real estate, and he built a—or had built—he didn't do it personally, but he commissioned
many houses on the East Side.

JL: During the 1930s, or before the 1930s?

BWM: Well, I'd say from the middle '20s to just past the Depression.

JL: [02:00] Where did you go to high school?

BWM: Hope.

2

JL: Hope?

BWM: That was a good school in those days. Very good.

JL: Tell me about it.

BWM: And we walked both ways. And now that I think of it, it was a distance. But if it were bad
weather we took the trolley. But I don't remember doing that. Mainly we walked. And there were
three separate sections in the school. One was a commercial course and one was a general
course, and the third one was a classical course. And we never saw the other people. They were
foreigners, you know? The classical people stuck together, and all our classes were together.
[03:00] And I know Ruth Lubrano and her husband Jack were, I think, almost the oldest
alumna—alumni from Brown. Jack was a science teacher when I was a freshman. And Marian
[Strouts?], and Edna MacDonald was a Pembroker. She was the Civics teacher. And Mrs.
[Cushing?], Susanna, was the French teacher. And Isabel Hall was the English teacher. And
Teddy Dexter was the math teacher. So we had all our own teachers, completely separate from
the rest of the school. I think the only time we saw them was at lunch. [04:00]
But it was a good school, and they did teach us well. Not the same Hope's. When we read
about it today, everybody says, "Did you read about our (inaudible) [whole pie?]?" Not the same
thing.

JL: Did other people from your class at Hope go to Brown or Pembroke?

BWM: Well, a lot of them boys went to Brown. Many of them. It'll come to me after a while
who did. But not the girls. The girls didn't go to school in those days. One of my classmates went
to Wheaton. And I don't think there was anyone that went to Pembroke, went to Brown. Not in
my class. The year after, by then, I guess, the Depression had eased a bit, and so there were
[05:00] friends of mine in the school. The first year, I didn't know a soul. And of course, I didn't
live there. That made a difference, too.

JL: You were a city girl.
3

BWM: I was a—I walked home, I walked up there, and I walked home. And that was it.
Sometimes the trolley, but I didn't mingle too much, because the girls in the dorms had their own
friends. But by the second year there were many local girls whom I knew. Although not
necessarily from Hope. From Classical, mainly.

JL: And girls from the private schools?

BWM: I don't think so. I don't remember anyone from a private school. Of course, at that time,
there was only Lincoln. Wheeler was—that was different. Wheeler was a boarding school at that
time. [06:00] And I don't remember anyone at Brown from the boarding—from the private
schools. They all went out of town. Even in my daughter's day, they didn't go to school here.

JL: Why do you think that was?

BWM: Too fancy. (laughter) Why else? And it cost them so much money to put them through
the under—the lower grades; I guess they wanted them—and the girls wanted to go out of town.
Although I always said I was lucky we had a good college in Providence, because my dad was
not allowing me out of town. And I was young. So that was another thing.

JL: How old were you when you—?

BWM: I was 16 when I graduated from Hope. So—because they—in those days they used to
skip you. [07:00] You know, you'd skip the grade. So I remember I skipped the fifth grade,
which was decimals, and the seventh grade, which was something else in math—two math
courses that I never had. But I'm good at it today. I learned it myself.

JL: So did either of your parents go to college?

BWM: My parents? No.

4

JL: No?

BWM: No.

JL: But they wanted you to go.

BWM: My mother was five or six when she came to this country, and she went to school here.
My dad was 18, but he knew English because he had gone—he always said the "gymnasium" in
Russia. And so he had a good education before he got here, and he knew English. And neither
[08:00] of them ever spoke with an accent.

JL: Was your mother from Russia as well?

BWM: She was from Austria. But in those days everything melted into one another. Sometimes
it was Austria, sometimes it was Poland—the same city. And sometimes it would be Russia. But
my dad came from Moldavia in Russia.

JL: What year did he come?

BWM: 1895, I think. And Mother came about the same time. But as I say, she was a youngster
and went to school in Providence through the eighth grade. I guess that's as far as most people
went.

JL: Do you have brothers and sisters?

BWM: I have two, or had two brothers.

JL: Older?

5

BWM: Younger. I'm the oldest. And the middle one, [09:00] who was a year and a half younger
than I, died last year, and the baby, who's 10 years younger, he's still around. He graduated from
Brown also.

JL: And the middle one?

BWM: He went to PC.

JL: Hmm. He went to a Catholic college?

BWM: Well, his best friend couldn't get into Brown and was going to PC, so that's where he
went. Then the other one got into Brown and went to Brown. But he didn't want to change,
because by that time he was—had a girlfriend, and he was all set. So he stayed and graduated
from PC.

JL: Did your father go and work in the jewelry trade when he first got here?

BWM: Oh, yes. He worked about a year and then he became a foreman, which in those days was
very special. [10:00] And then within 10 years he opened his own business.

JL: Where was his business?

BWM: Where? 158 Pine Street. Right behind the Lowes, PPAC,—right behind there.

JL: So you went to Hope High, and then you graduated at 16 and went to Pembroke. Tell me
your first impressions of Pembroke.

BWM: Well, the first impression, of course, was Pembroke Hall. And that was dark. Very dark.
And it was—the library, which to me is very important, always has been, was on the third floor,
but it was really the fourth floor, because you had to walk up a full flight before you got to the
first floor. And that was quite a hike up to that third floor. [11:00] I can still remember
6

(laughter), I'd get up there all out of breath, because in those days all the buildings had high
ceilings. So they weren't flights such as you have today.
And all the classes were held at Pembroke Hall. And as I said, next door there was a
frame house—I don't remember what they called it—and that was for locals who had to hang
around between classes, so you hung around in that whatever-it-was. Isn't it funny, I don't
remember the name. But as I say, there was always a bridge table set up, and that's where I spent
most of my time, playing bridge.

JL: Not in the library?

BWM: Hmm?

JL: Not in the library. You didn't spend your time in the library.

BWM: No, very little, because that third floor was too hot. I remember that [12:00] I very
seldom went to the library. And if we needed a book, I didn’t buy them, usually, because I was a
very—I am a very good typist. And so I would take the book out of the library, the textbook, and
take my notes on the typewriter and give the book back. And then I didn't need it anymore. I
never had to buy it. I don't think I bought two books in the four years. Because that's how I
studied. And, of course, the notes were typed, so they were legible.

JL: What was your major?

BWM: Sociology. Now, ask me why.

JL: Why?
BWM: Yes. Because that’s very important. (laughter) It was a new department, and there were
only two professors. The head of the department was named [Buckingham?]. [13:00] He was
short and redheaded. The other one was tall—I can't remember his name, but he did most of the
work. But because there were only two professors, there were very few courses. And so I had a
7

very well-rounded education; I could take anything else I wanted, because my major had so few
that it didn't matter—they didn't care whether I—what I took. And I really got into almost
everything they had. The music, the art, the sciences, which I hated—and, of course, freshman
year, all the women, a required course was biology, because they taught you the reproductive
system. Not the men; they didn't have to take it, but the women had to. And as I say, the reason I
majored in sociology— [14:00] they had no classes before 10:00 AM; even in those days I never
got up early. And there were no Saturday classes. And if you took a science, you were stuck,
because they had the lab courses lasted till six o'clock. And so every weekend was killed,
because they always had met Saturday morning. I remember that, and I wouldn't take those. But
as I say, I did economics, psych, I had at least one—German, French, at least one course in each
department. So I had a well-rounded education.

JL: You did. Do you remember that freshman biology class?

BWM: Oh, yes, it was—

JL: Tell me about it.
BWM: —it was taught by a woman, of course. They weren't going [15:00] to have it taught by a
man when it was all women in the class. And it was required: every freshman had to take it. And
what I remember mainly about it was that you had to dissect a frog, which I wasn’t going to do.
But I found someone who would do it (laughter) who was my partner—I don't remember who
she was, even. But she did that, the dirty work.
But other than that I don't remember the course at all. Probably didn’t listen. But—

JL: Do you remember any of the deans?

BWM: The what?

JL: The deans, like Dean Morris? The deans. The women in charge, the sup—you know—

8

BWM: Oh, Miss Moar—of course, everyone knew Miss Moar. M-O-A-R [Dean Eva A. Mooar].
She was the Dean of Women at that time. [16:00] And Miss Morriss, who was the Dean of the
College. We called her Peggy Push; her name was Margaret Shove Morriss. So that was a good
name for her. Very impressive-looking woman—I can picture her now. Very attractive. Not
attractive like Marilyn Monroe attractive, but very, very upright and stern; very nice.
I remember Professor Hedges—he was American history. He was very good. And—can't
think of his name now, but there was an English professor who taught drama who was very
good. And, of course, Professor Coolidge in the [17:00] music department. Other than that, don’t
remember anybody. Long time ago.

JL: Did you do the physical education course?

BWM: Oh, yes, we had gym. That was in the—what they now call Smith-Buonanno. That was—
and everybody had to take gym and everyone had to have a physical profile. Naked. That was
stupid. You know, we had to stand up in front of a screen, and they would draw how your—the
shape of your body. I don't know, I never saw what the finished product, but everybody had to do
that freshman year. And you had a choice each season of different courses, and one, I remember,
was horseback riding. And I signed up for it, and actually, they got me up on the horse, that was
it. [18:00] I never realized how high it is. I took golf instead, which I never did learn to play. And
swimming. You had to know how to swim—you had to swim the length of the pool, the long
part, before you could graduate. And on Commencement Day, there were girls swimming and
swimming and swimming, trying to complete that one requirement. But I was brought up at the
beach, so that didn't bother me one bit.

JL: Where was the swimming pool, then?

BWM: It must have been at Lyman, you know, at the men's [dorm?], because it wasn't at the
women's place. I think that was about the—and then senior year you had seminars, so you went
to the regular campus. Other than that, I don't think we ever got over there. [19:00]

JL: So your first three years you were on the Pembroke campus?
9

BWM: Oh, yes. That’s true. I don't think there was any reason to go over, unless you had a
boyfriend, you know. But I meant, as far as school went, there was no reason to go to the men's
campus. But we used to walk over, naturally, and then there was chapel twice a week, Tuesday
and Thursday, at nine o'clock. That was awful. For me. And Tuesdays, they used to have sort of
religious services, and I remember at the end they always sang the doxology. And Thursday they
would have a speaker, either someone well-known or one of the professors. [20:00] So that was a
different type of chapel. But you had to be there, and they took attendance.

JL: Where was this?

BWM: At Alumnae Hall, which was new at that time. I think it was built in '28, something like
that. That's where they held it, chapel.

JL: So just for the Pembroke girls there.

BWM: Oh, just for the girls. And we had to wear our caps and gowns to the chapel services.
Every week, you really got your money's worth out of it.

JL: This was presumably a Baptist service? It was Protestant?

BWM: Yes. Well, as I would say, I remember the doxology.

JL: Yeah.

BWM: And we'd all close our mouths—you know, the Jewish girls—very tightly. It was "Praise
Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost."

JL: But you couldn't get out of it. [21:00]

BWM: No.
10

JL: You had to go.

BWM: We had to go. It was required. And if you didn't show—they took attendance, both days.

JL: So how did the Jewish girls react to this? Apart—you just kept your mouth shut, or—?

BWM: Well, that's all they did. Nobody would sing the song. Other than that, you listened. And
as I say, Thursdays, they had Martha Baird Allen—I remember her so well. She was a pianist,
and she—later, when her husband died, her first husband, she married John D. Rockefeller, Jr.
She was a very pretty woman, and an accomplished pianist.

JL: And did she work at Pembroke?

BWM: No, no.

JL: No.

BWM: She lived at the corner of Upton and the Boulevard. It's a house with a stone wall—that's
where she lived. When she was married to her first husband, [22:00] who was an attorney, I
believe with Edwards and Angell; one of the big fir—there was only two at that time. The other
was Tillinghast-something-or-other. But that was her first husband, but she always—they had no
children, and she always played in concerts, all over the world. And she used to come and do it
for the girls at Pembroke. And Thursday—some Thursday. Very pretty woman. I can still picture
her.

JL: And tell me her name again?

BWM: Hmm?

JL: Tell me her name again?
11

BWM: Martha Baird, B-A-I-R-D—Allen was her first husband. And then, as I say, she married
John D. Rockefeller, whom she knew through her husband, because they were classmates at
Brown. That was a good way.

JL: [23:00] You said you would go across to the main campus for—to meet male friends. Did
you have a group of friends that you hung around?

BWM: Yeah, but nobody went over there, really. Unless you had a boyfriend, and then you—or
you were looking for one. Then you would go over to Brown. Otherwise there was no reason to
go there. All your courses, all your classes were at Pembroke, and as I say, until you were a
senior and you had a seminar, that was different. Then you had to go to the Brown campus. I
remember I had one Wednesdays at two o'clock, every Wednesday, and I was late every week
because I overslept. Nobody believes me, (laughter) but I could do that very easily, even today.
[24:00]

JL: Were you involved in any extracurricular activities?

BWM: There really—I wasn't. I mean, I think the main thing they had was drama: they put on
plays, and they had the daisy chain in the spring, but other than that—or glee club, they had a
newspaper, but I didn't do anything. I was too busy with bridge. I had enough extracurriculars.
(laughter)

JL: But that was unofficial extracurricular.

BWM: Yes, yes. That's where I spent most of my time.

JL: Now, I looked at the class about—actually, the nine—in the middle of the '30s. About half
the students, the Pembroke students, seemed to come from Providence or nearby.

BWM: Well—
12

JL: Is that about right, what you'd say?

BWM: I would think most of them did come from Providence. There weren't that many. [25:00]
The out-of-town girls came from New York or Connecticut, most of them. And they kind of kept
to themselves. The two groups never really mingled. They had a freshman sister, and so when
you came in as a freshman, a senior was designated as your sister, and she was supposed to help
you through the tribulations of freshman year, but I never knew who my senior was. And when I
was a senior, my freshman died. Immediately. Never got there. So. (laughter) I never really
participated in that program at all, but I know my sister-in-law, who also, when she was [26:00]
class of '39, she up until she died was still friendly with her senior sister. But she was a local girl.
See, that's how they did it.

JL: They would pair locals with locals and outsiders with outsiders.

BWM: Right.

JL: Yeah.

BWM: Because if you were in the dorm, you didn't even know—I never knew anybody in the
dorm. Very few. If they were in my class then I would know them, but the classes were not too
large. I remember the history course with Hedges. That was a very large class, where it had the
men, too. At Pembroke. We didn't go to Brown; they came to us. (laughter) And I remember that
had—well, like theatre seating, where it went up—that's the only room I remember that had that
type of seating.

JL: Where was that room?

BWM: This— [27:00] in Pembroke Hall. I don't know where it was or what, but it was a very
large class, and the seats went up as they do in a theatre, but that's the only room I remember.
The other classes were all small.
13

JL: Did you have classes in that room with the sort of Roman frieze around the ceiling?

BWM: Upstairs?

JL: Yeah, on the second floor.

BWM: I don't remember. I don't remember it—the first floor was all offices. So the second floor
was classrooms. But I don't remember—I evidently never looked up there.

JL: What did you—well, tell me about commencement.

BWM: Well, commencement—I never went to baccalaureate; that was too early in the morning.
So I didn’t get to that at all. [28:00] I went to the commencement, and for many years afterwards
I did go in March. I managed to get there. But I don't remember it being such a big deal as it is
today. Of course, it was much smaller. There were 105 in my class. And now there are about
1,400—quite a difference. And out of the 105, maybe—I don't think there's even 20 left. But
nobody comes—only one girl came to [read?]—two of us—two from Providence came, myself
and one other, and a girl from Braintree. Because her son-in-law was also from Brown and had
reunions, so we took (inaudible). But other than that nobody showed up for the last couple of
[29:00] reunions. Our chairman got angry a couple of years ago at something, I don't know why
or what, and quit right in the middle and said, "We're not having any more reunions." And so she
won't come—she lives in Cumberland. And she won't do anything. So this year, Lillian came
from Braintree, and Dottie Nelson and myself, that's all that was there. So we made our own
election, (laughter) (inaudible)'s the president and I'm secretary archivist and Dottie has the bank
book, so she's the treasurer. (laughter) What else could we do?

JL: Right. So you do have some archives of your class, then.

BWM: I'm supposed to, and they would be down in the basement.

14

JL: Well, when somebody comes—

BWM: [30:00] I'm going to have her look, because I don't go down there anymore. I can go
down—it's coming up that's tough.

JL: Right. When you had graduated, what did you do next?

BWM: When—?

JL: After you graduated, what did you do?

BWM: Oh, what did I do. Well, first I did social work. And that was by accident. I walked into
Pembroke Hall one day, and the girl who was in charge of placement for graduate said, "Oh,
you're just who I need." It just happened that there was an opening from—I've forgotten what
they called it now, but to comb through the records of people on welfare and take off the ones
who don't belong. So she gave me the job, and she said [31:00] it'd be about three months. Well,
as it happened, the office was in Apponaug. You know where Apponaug is? West Warwick. So
the first day I went out there with a friend who also was a—but she was a couple of years ahead
of me. So we both went out there for the job, and when we got there they were in a real dither
because they had to turn in a report to the federal government, and nobody knew how to type. So
they said, "Does anyone know how to type?" And I said, "I do." So they sat me down—I never
got away from the desk for three years. Literally, that was wonderful, because the other girl had
to [32:00] go out to Sand Hill Cove and out with the Indian tribes at that time, who were very
poor and very—they had terrible lives. Terrible living conditions. And so she had to go out and
mingle and find out what's going on, but I had just sat and typed. And that came in very handy,
and I taught myself to type, because I never had it in school. Because I took a classical course.
But I learned to type and to do shorthand. And to do accounting, actually, because I could go all
the way through [trial balance?], they called it. So that's what I did first.
Then the next thing—my dad had a bookkeeper who had been with him [33:00] for 25
years, and her mother died. So now—she would have been engaged all that time; now she could
get married. So she was leaving. So he said to me, "Come in and show the next girl how to do
15

whatever it is, and—till I get somebody else." So I did, and I was there till I got pregnant with
my daughter. That's when I left. After that, I didn't do anything until my son graduated from
college. And then I said, "It's time I did something for myself," and I went back for a Master's
degree. And that's what I did. When I got the—I got the Master's degree in Library Science. So
that was from URI, and we used to go to where Henry Barnard school was. [34:00] So then they
were looking for me. At that time they needed professional librarians desperately, so they came
looking for me and I got the position at Nathan Bishop Middle School right here in Elmgrove
Avenue. That was very good, and I was there for 15 years. When I think of it now, I don't know
how I ever stood it. But by the time I really said, "I can't take another day," it would either be a
pay day or a vacation week, whatever, I managed to get through 15 years. And of course I left
them because they made a special offer, and you could only teach until you were 70, and I was
68. So that's when I left.
And since then I've played bridge. Again. Because I never really stopped. I played other
games in between, [35:00] but that's my first love. I don't know if either of you play, but—

M: I don't.

JL: My mother used to. She used to love bridge.

BWM: Well, that's how I started, because Mother played. But she played whist, and I'd sit and
watch, and that's how I learned. And then she played auction bridge and then contract came in,
so that's how I got into the game.

JL: So you play contract bridge now?

BWM: Oh, yes.

JL: That's what my mother used to play.

BWM: Yes. Oh, well, that's all they play now. I don't think anybody—well, maybe they do, but I
don't know anybody who plays auction bridge. But they say I'm a good player.
16

JL: What—?

BWM: Without complimenting myself.

JL: Where do you play?

BWM: Well, I used to play at the square where they had a duplicate game, tournament bridge,
but I can't walk those stairs anymore, so [36:00] I'll play with my friends. Not really a good
game, but better than—at least you get out and see people. Makes a difference.

JL: What would you say, in conclusion, was—you got out of your Brown, or Pembroke,
education?

BWM: What did I gain?

JL: Yeah.

BWM: I would have done it anyways. Really. Because I always like to read, and I do retain what
I read, even today. And I learn. And that's how I play bridge—I listen. If you don't listen you're
never going to learn. Try to tell that to my friends but they don't believe me, when it comes to the
bridge game. But it works for everything. And so I was always interested [37:00] in learning and
picking up new things, so I think it—I don't think it would have mattered.

JL: You could have gone anywhere.

BWM: I—as I say, I graduated from college, but I am perfectly capable of being a commercial
student, because I learned that on my own. And I can do it. And anything I want to do. If I—I
know if you work at it, you can do it. So I don't think it would have made too much difference.
But to my parents, it did. I mean, there was no question about that; we were all going to go to
college, the three of us. And as I said, my young brother went to Brown, the middle one went to
17

PC. And my daughter went to Brown. My grandson, her son, [38:00] went to Brown. He went to
the medical school, the undergraduate and the medical school. And he had his choice—could
have gone anywhere. Very, very brilliant young man. But when he—I was thrilled because he
was interested in medicine, and that program offered him both. He majored in music. We all felt
that we had a good school to go to locally, which was very important, since we were not going to
go out of town.

JL: Why were they so adamant you didn't go out of town?

BWM: Because my dad felt you had to be home every night and sleep in your own bed. And if
you want to go to a friend's house, uh-uh, you have them come to your house to stay over. I
never, [39:00] never had a—my little one calls it a "sleepover"—because we were not allowed.
We were home every night. But we could have anybody at any time that we wanted to. But
today, of course, it's a different story. But Carol-Ann had her—my daughter had her choice; she
went to Brown, and Andrew, the doctor, my grandson the doctor, he had a choice of any place,
and he decided that Brown offered him the most of what he wanted, because he had his music
and the medicine. And he's working at the NIH, as they say. He just got a new fellowship
[40:00]—they paid all his loans. Very good.

JL: That's great. Is there anything else you'd like us to have on the tape? Anything else you'd like
to tell us?

BWM: Well, I think it's important that local people send their kids to Brown. I really do. And I
know that, you know, they had thought of a bad connotation today, "oh, Brown," you know, they
want to go to Harvard, but as they say, my grandson had a choice—Harvard, Princeton, Yale—
he came up for one afternoon when they had an orientation, and he fell in love with the place.
And they lived in Boston. So I think if people will give the school a chance, [41:00] that it’s the
best place. Even though you—Carol-Ann lived at school when she went there. I didn't; I lived at
home. But she lived at the dorms.

JL: So did she have a very different experience, do you think?
18

BWM: Well, of course, every Thursday night she'd come home with a gang, because they didn't
like the food, whatever it was, Thursday night. So she always came home Thursday with a few
friends and ate at home. But other than that, she was at the dorm and she loved it.

JL: What year did she graduate?

BWM: 'Fifty-nine. And Andrew was '86. So I have my own medical team. My daughter's
daughter, my granddaughter, is an RN. But she didn't go to Brown. And so when I [42:00] need
help in anything medical and I ask her, she says, "Yecch." She can't stand the sight of blood. This
is the RN. (laughter) And Math—I always call him Matthew. Andrew, Matthew, Michael.
Andrew, the physician, you ask him a question, he says, "Patient's choice." So you can imagine
how far I get with the two of them.

JL: (laughter)

BWM: That's what all the doctors say. "Patient's choice."

JL: You said a few minutes ago that Brown doesn't have the right kind of reputation locally. It's
like—

BWM: No. Never did.

JL: Why? Explain.

BWM: I don't know why. You know, it's an Ivy League school, but it never, ever felt that way.
Not—I mean, it was always Harvard first. That's number one. And then Yale— [43:00] eh.
Princeton was okay. I think it was Harvard, Princeton, Yale here. But Brown was way down the
bottom somewhere.

JL: Do you know why?
19

BWM: I have no idea. I have no idea. But I know that even when I went and people would say,
"Well, where did you go to school?", and I'd say "Brown," you can see their noses turn up. But it
was a good school, and I did enjoy it. That's true, and I learned. They had small classes, on the
whole—as I say, the history and some of the English classes were large, but other than that
everything was maybe 20, tops. I don't think they were that large. And so you did have a lot of
interplay with the professor, and the assistants, [44:00] you know, who always corrected the
papers even then.

JL: So you had discussions in class. That's good.

BWM: And I had a good time.

JL: I think you did.

BWM: (laughter)

JL: I think that place where you played bridge was called East House?

BWM: Maybe—yes, I think you're right. Yes. It was just down the hill, the next—

JL: Where the steps are now.

BWM: Right. Right. That's exactly where I was. That's what it was, East House. And as I say,
they had a bridge table set up and there was always a game going. If one left another one showed
up, so. And I have a friend who was a year behind me, and she always tells the story—we had a
class together, and she said, "The night before, you sat and played bridge all night and I was
cramming," and she says, "You got an A and I didn't. " [45:00] Still angry. (laughter) But as I
say, that to me was the best relaxation. And I kept up on my work—that I did. So. I didn't have to
cram at the last minute. But my kids always did.

20

JL: They crammed?

BWM: And Donald, my son, (inaudible)—he's an attorney and went to University of
Pennsylvania law school. He was always the last second, and I can remember one night my
daughter and I were each typing his papers for the next morning, till five o'clock in the morning,
to get it done. But that's the way he always did it. And he didn't know how to type either. And I
said to him, "It's so important—I think it's a very important—it's a skill, [46:00] like anything
else." I said, "I'll show you how it's so easy—" doesn't have to. I said, "Why not?" "Because
they'll have a secretary." Which he does. So what can I tell you? He was right. But I always felt
typing was very important to know how. And I taught my daughter how to do it—she wanted to
go to school, I said, "You don't have to take a class; I'll show you." I had the book—so easy. But
of course, today, when I was teaching at Bishop, the typing class was in the next room, and I
used to die when I'd see the kids. They would put the book in their lap and go like this. Well,
you're never going to learn to type. You have to do it this way. [47:00] Couldn't convince those
kids. Of course, they never did learn to type. The book in the lap, you'll never learn. But it's a
very important skill. Of course today, it's, I guess—although I see them all with the computers,
pick and peck. You know, so they still should know how to type.

JL: They should. They should indeed. This has been really interesting. You've—

BWM: Why, thank you.
JL: —told us a lot of good stuff here.

BWM: I didn't know how it would work out, but—

JL: And it's been a pleasure talking to you, and to hear all of this about, what, 70 years ago?
That's a long time, isn't it?

BWM: Yes, it sure is. It's a long time.

21

JL: And you remember it well.
