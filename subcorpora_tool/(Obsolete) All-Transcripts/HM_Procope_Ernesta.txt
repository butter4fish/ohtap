Story_ID: 343945
Speaker 1: So let's start with five very People magazine type questions, short answers.  Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: That's hard to say.  When you say food, do you mean a combination of foods: a pie, a cake, a certain kind of meat?
Speaker 1: Whichever is your--what comes to mind when I ask you your favorite food?  Is it a pie, a cake or a combination?

But always remember we're not selling potatoes, we're not selling onions.  We're selling service.
Story_ID: 343946
Speaker 1: So we're gonna start, and we're gonna start with your family tree as much as you can remember about it.  And we will start with your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give me your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Elvira Lord [Elvira Lord Forster], L-O-R-D.
Speaker 1: And your mother's place of birth?
Speaker 2: St. Lucia, British West Indies.
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about your mother?  Did she--as far as her life as a child in Barbados, did she ever talk about it?
Speaker 2: In St. Lucia.
Speaker 1: In St. Lucia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was born in St. Lucia.  I think her father died when she was eight.  Her father's name was Edward Lord and as I recall I'm just trying to remember some of the things that she told me.  She didn't tell me too many because I should have--I didn't inquire about many things and I should have.  Edward Lord was a chief revenue officer in Castries, St. Lucia.  He would ride horseback and collect taxes.  So that was his occupation.  That was her father.  His father was Sam Lord [Samuel Hall Lord] and Sam Lord is from--was from Barbados and he's allegedly in Barbados, because he owned a castle called Sam Lord's Castle [St. Philip, Barbados] and it was right on the water and this is nothing to brag about and perhaps I shouldn't even talk about it, but he was, he was a pirate.  He would see to it--he would wreck ships in the middle of the ocean and take the goodies, and he knew when they were coming because he had a false light--lighthouse in the water and he could--and they would go to that lighthouse, because they thought it was a place of refuge and it wasn't.  But that was Sam Lord, who was Edward Lord's father, my mother's grandfather.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: That's all I know.
Speaker 1: Okay but what do you know about their nationality?  Were they black or were the mixed with something?  What can you tell me about them?
Speaker 2: I imagine Sam Lord had to be white.  He was from England.  I think he came to Barbados in the 1850s.
Speaker 1: And what about your mother?  The your mother was--
Speaker 2: My mother had a black mother, and I presume Edward Lord was mixed.
Speaker 1: And Edward Lord died when she was eight years old.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what did your mother's mother [Elizabeth Armour Lord] do to make ends meet after her father had died?
Speaker 2: I, I, I don't know and I've never inquired.  I think she also died at a very--when my mother was very young and I think my mother was raised by her sisters who lived there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many sisters did she have?
Speaker 2: She had three that I know of.
Speaker 1: Now did they stay in St. Lucia?
Speaker 2: No, my mother left when she was sixteen.
Speaker 1: And where did she come to?
Speaker 2: Straight to Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: Now how did she get to Brooklyn?  Who did she know in Brooklyn?
Speaker 2: Well she had a sister in Brooklyn and that's how she made the connection so she, she went through Ellis Island [New York, New York].  I remember her telling me about that and she settled in Brooklyn, downtown Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: What did she say about (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And she was taught how to cook and she, she learned how to cook and she, she got jobs as a cook in Brooklyn and she became quite, quite an excellent cook.  So that's what she did.
Speaker 1: What did she say about traveling through Ellis Island, about her trip, about--I mean I'm sure--did they have to sign in or get shots or was there a process that she--?
Speaker 2: I never discussed that with her.  All I know is that she came through Ellis Island when she was sixteen and never went back.
Speaker 1: So did she ever remarry or after?
Speaker 2: No she married Clarence Forster, my father.
Speaker 1: But then he died when she--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, I'm thinking about her father okay yes so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes that was Edward Lord.
Speaker 1: That was Edward.
Story_ID: 343947
Speaker 1: Okay so then she [Procope's mother, Elvira Lord Forster] meets and marries your father [Clarence Forster]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and let's talk about your father and his side of the family.
Speaker 2: My father was born in Barbados, and he attended elementary school and high school in Barbados.  I think that his trade was the tailor.  He became a tailor, a master tailor.  However, his father was not pleased with the whole economic situation in Barbados.  He had four other brothers and a sister.  And the father decided that he should look for work outside of Barbados, perhaps the United States and the father had connections with the Cunard-White Star Line [Cunard-White Star Line, Ltd.] and made arrangements for my father to be hired by the Cunard-White Star Line and he worked for them as a seaman for many, many years.  I'm trying to think of his title and whatever it was, he was able to move up, and I'm trying to think of the word that they used for people the seaman on ships who take care of the people, what is it?
Speaker 1: Is it a porter?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, that's the train.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Steward.  He became chief steward at the Cunard-White Star Line, which was a pretty good position at that time.
Speaker 1: So do you know anything about his mother and father?
Speaker 2: Not too much.  I knew my grandmother because she came here also to live.  His father was Scotch and he used to import meat from Puerto Rico into Barbados; that was his occupation.  And he lived together with my grandmother and they had five children, four boys and one girl.
Story_ID: 343948
Speaker 1: So once your mother [Elvira Lord Forster] and father [Clarence Forster] marry and start a family here in Brooklyn [New York] and you're born, what are your earliest memories of life in Brooklyn with your mother and father?
Speaker 2: Well we, we were a closely knit family.  My mother was a very soft spoken, very pleasant lady and she didn't have much to say but when she said it she meant it.  My father was a dominant, domineering kind of person but she was able to handle him very well.  He was a good man.  He took care of his children.
Speaker 1: So what neighborhood did they live in?
Speaker 2: We lived on Greene Avenue between Franklin [Avenue] and Classon [Avenue].  It was the Bedford section of Brooklyn at that time.  We did not speak in terms of Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] because Stuyvesant was quite a ways from Bedford but we lived in the Bedford section of Brooklyn and my mother and father bought two houses while there.
Speaker 1: So do you know why they would go to Bedford as opposed to Harlem [New York, New York] at that time?
Speaker 2: Because Bedford consisted of brownstones and red brick houses and if you know West Indian people, they're interested in, in buying, they don't want to rent and they were interested in buying properties so they bought the first piece of property and they lived there and then they bought a second piece of property and that's where I was born at the second piece of property in Brooklyn.  But they enjoyed being homeowners.
Speaker 1: So can you tell me anything--I was reading about Bedford, there is a section called the Weeksville [Brooklyn, New York]?
Speaker 2: That's not in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, that's in the Brownsville section.  That's like East New York [Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay so that's not related at all?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Story_ID: 343949
Speaker 1: Keep talking about your childhood.  What are some the things you remember about the neighborhood [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York] itself?  Can you describe it for me and the at- (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I remember there was a church close by Siloam Presbyterian Church [New York, New York].  We became Presbyterians.  And I enjoyed going to Sunday school, I enjoyed going to church and I guess it was right around that time I--eight or nine years of age.  I was interested in music and my mother [Elvira Lord Forster] saw to it that I took piano lessons and I never had a problem practicing as most children do.  I would come home from school and practice first and then do my homework.  So I really enjoyed my, my musical career starting at the age of eight and when I was twelve I performed at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] and I thought that that was quite a feat for me and music has always been my, my interest.  I just feel bad because I, I haven't done anything with it since I became involved in the insurance brokerage business.  But perhaps one day I'll get back to it.
Speaker 1: So I read that you were a child prodigy.
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But where did the interest in the piano come from?
Speaker 2: Well my father [Clarence Forster] was--used to sing very well and he sang in the church choir.  His brothers I think were also interested in music.  So I guess it came from his background rather than my mother.
Story_ID: 343950
Speaker 1: So what were holidays like in the household?  The traditional--?
Speaker 2: Getting ready for Christmas was always a lot of fun.  Going out to purchase a Christmas tree and then bringing it home to decorate it and just waiting for Christmas day and waking up in the morning to see what I received for Christmas, what my brothers [Clarence Forster, Jr., Cecil Forster, and Charles Forster] didn't or did give me and what they would take away from me if they got angry with me.  But it was always fun.
Speaker 1: You said that your mother [Elvira Lord Forster] was a good cook?  What were the traditional foods you had for Christmas?
Speaker 2: Well the normal foods that most people have, roast turkey with--she would do peas and rice which was a West Indian dish and I would say though she was pretty much an American cook and so everything was pretty much American, candied yams, cranberry sauce, a vegetable of some kind, spinach.
Speaker 1: Was it her pound cake that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --interest you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  And of course at that time she also made a plum cake.  I think they called it plum cake, plum pudding with a sauce and that would be dessert for Christmas but--at the Christmas meal.
Story_ID: 343951
Speaker 1: So at the Christmas meal--I mean traditionally, did the family have meals together or did you eat as you came home or was there a sit down dinner (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we always ate meals together.  We always sat down together and ate.  Never ate separately.
Speaker 1: Now how many siblings did you have?
Speaker 2: Three brothers [Clarence Forster, Jr., Cecil Forster, and Charles Forster], one sister [Marjory Forster] who died in infancy.  They were all older.
Speaker 1: So the family tradition was to sit around the table and eat at the same time?
Speaker 2: All the time.
Speaker 1: All the time.  Can you remember some of the things you talked about at those round table discus- dinner discussions?  What would you talk about in general?
Speaker 2: During those days, it wasn't easy, it was tough and I remember my brothers going to school but also working in between because they had to make it for themselves not that my father [Clarence Forster] could not support them but they felt an obligation to contribute to the family as well.  I had one brother who became a Ph.D. in psychology and another brother who is in the real estate business and another one who is an electrician.  They all became productive in their various occupations.  And so as you can see there was quite a difference a psychologist, a real estate person, and an electrician (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) An electrician. So your father I guess instilled in all of you.  Can you remember some of your mother's [Elvira Lord Forster] and father's rules of the house?  How were you raised?
Speaker 2: They, they weren't strict but they had rules and regulations for us to follow and if we didn't follow them, there would be a penalty of some kind (laughter).
Story_ID: 343952
Speaker 1: Can you paint for me a picture of what the neighborhood looked like as far as the other--who your neighbors were?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were there any local black owned businesses in Bedford [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York] at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, as I recall, we lived on a block where there were about I would say three black families out of about between both sides of the street, I would say about forty families.  And I played with most of the children there.  There were some children who didn't wanna play with me and I, I understood prejudice back there at that time as well.  But I had a good relationship with those kids who did play with me and the other black children.  We had--I thought we had a good relationship except we did have children who didn't wanna play with us, and we left them alone.
Speaker 1: So Bedford was not a black, all black, well, very little black people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not at that time.  No.
Speaker 1: Well who made up the neighborhood then?
Speaker 2: Germans, Italians and Irish.
Speaker 1: So it was an immigrant neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I would say so.
Speaker 1: So why do you think it had attracted the three, were they all Caribbean families?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: The other ones were just American blacks (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The other one as I recall was an American family.  I think they were from the South.  I remember the father had a job at the post office and the mother was a house wife.  Then there was a Caribbean family next door to us.  I don't remember what he did, but whatever it was it was productive.  He raised a family, and they did well.  No such thing as welfare in those days (laughter).
Speaker 1: How as the neigh- then the neighborhood was a middle class neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I would say so.
Speaker 1: Everyone there--I mean at the time you mainly saw two parent households?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Story_ID: 343953
Speaker 1: What did you do for entertainment then as a child during this time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well my mother [Elvira Lord Forster] was very active with the Crispus Attucks Community Council [Brooklyn, New York].  It was a community organization trying to better the lives of black people in general in Brooklyn [New York] and they would meet once a week.  My mother was an ardent supporter of this organization.  She believed in buying black and being black and did everything in her power way back there to see to it that things happened.  I remembered when I was a little girl that the Cris- Crispus Attucks Community Council had a program of seeing to it that F.W. Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] at the time hired blacks and they picketed the five and ten cent store on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, which was an all-white neighborhood mixed of course with, with some blacks, but predominantly white and my mother was on that picket line way back there in the, in the early '40s [1940s] so you know she was, she was a militant quiet as she was, she was a militant and because of that picketing that the Crispus Attucks Community Council did, F.W. Woolworth was forced to hire blacks.
Speaker 1: Take a drink. You said your mother was interested in buying black?  Can you remember some of that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, she would go out of her way--
Speaker 1: Can you tell me some of the black places--?
Speaker 2: --in our neighborhood, there was, in our neighborhood there was a grocery store, maybe about eight blocks away and she would pass by the white grocery stores to go to that black grocery store and each week she would buy her groceries from this store and they would deliver.  So, I, I gave her a lot of credit for that because a lot of people, most people didn't think like she did.
Speaker 1: How did she teach you and your brothers [Clarence Forster, Jr., Cecil Forster, and Charles Forster] about the fact that people would be prejudiced towards you, that those children in the neighborhood would be prejudiced towards because you were black?  How did she explain that when you was a child?
Speaker 2: I don't think she tried to explain it.  She would tell us, she would tell me rather because my brothers were much older than I that if these children did not wanna play with you, leave them alone.  That's their problem, not yours.  And you play with those children who want to be with you.  She didn't focus too much on the prejudice side of it.  I mean it was obvious what it was and I understood what it was.
Speaker 1: So your mother was somewhat of an activist in your community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would say so.
Speaker 1: Who else were the activists that you saw helping your mother (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well as I said she was a member of this Crispus Attucks Community Council.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: Crispus Attucks--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was--is C-R-I-S-P-U-S, A-T-T-U-C-K-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think he was involved--I think you need to check this for historical purposes, he was involved with the Boston [Massachusetts] problems that they had up there, many, many years ago with race relations.  He was a very important person in the community at that point and, and I think he would be good for your historical information, and the gentleman who started the organization in Brooklyn was George Wibecan.  George Wibecan was president of the Crispus Attucks Community Council that was fighting for the rights of black people in New York City [New York, New York], colored people at that time.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his last name for us?
Speaker 2: Wibecan?  W-I-B-E-C-A-N, George is the first name.
Speaker 1: Okay go ahead.  So this is good.  Tell me more about.
Speaker 2: Well this was the organization that tried to do something about black people and their problems.
Speaker 1: So were there weekly meetings?  How did you she, how did--yeah how did she--? Yeah.
Speaker 2: She would go to weekly meetings and they had an agenda.  You know remember I wasn't--I wasn't--
Speaker 1: Yeah I know you were a child.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm a kid.  I'm listening to all this.
Speaker 1: Yeah you're listening to.
Speaker 2: And they would have events in order to raise money but one of the things that they, that they focused on was employment and the company that they picked on was F.W. Woolworth.  I, I remember that very well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because they were a very racist company, yes.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Now who did your mother work for?  You said that she was a cook?  Do you remember who she cooked for?
Speaker 2: I think she worked in a restaurant.  I know she did in the--in Brooklyn Heights [Brooklyn, New York].  That was a very fine area at that time, still is for that matter, and I believe she was one of the cooks in a restaurant.
Speaker 1: Were there places you couldn't go in Brooklyn at the time?
Speaker 2: She told me that when she first came to this country looking for apartments for rent, that real estate offices many of them would have signs out saying, nothing for colored.  So that was her first experience with prejudice in Bed- in, in the Bedford [Bedford-Stuyvesant] section of Brooklyn, and I guess all of New York City you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean that's news to me.  I didn't know.
Speaker 2: That's right, nothing for colored.
Speaker 1: Nothing for colored. So they, now--
Speaker 2: This would be the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, this is the '30s [1930s]--
Story_ID: 343954
Speaker 1: Any other--you talked about becoming Presbyterian, did you go to church weekly every Sunday, once a month, for Easter (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I went, I went to Sunday school every Sunday and I attended church [at Siloam Presbyterian Church, Brooklyn, New York].  I would go with my mother [Elvira Lord Forster].
Speaker 1: Would you consider her a religious woman?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would.
Speaker 1: Your father [Clarence Forster]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he sang in the choir, he was religious.
Speaker 1: Okay so then I guess that anything else you wanna throw in about your early childhood in Brooklyn [New York], things that stands out for you, things that may have made a difference in who you are today?
Speaker 2: Well,--
Speaker 1: Oh, I know one thing--go on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) we were always told to respect each other and I would say the golden rule: do unto others as you would have others do unto you.  "Practice that," my mother would say, and "all you have to protect is your good name, nothing else.  Remember that, Ernesta [HistoryMaker Ernesta G. Procope]."
Story_ID: 343955
Speaker 1: Who was your piano teacher?
Speaker 2: I went to the New York School of Music [New York Schools of Music, Brooklyn, New York] beginning at the age of eight and that was located on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn [New York], so I would have to take a bus there.  My mother [Elvira Lord Forster] went with me for one year and then I was able to go by myself after that.
Speaker 1: Were there any other black students at the New York School of Music?
Speaker 2: I don't remember any others.  I'm sure there may have been.
Speaker 1: But it was not a black school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Why, why do you think your mother took it upon herself to send you to music school?
Speaker 2: I guess I demonstrated some interest in the piano, and as a result of that she saw to it that I attended a school that was credible.
Speaker 1: Now at the time did you want to become a musician for a living, you though?
Speaker 2: At, at the time I thought perhaps I might want to become a musician, but after the years rolled by I realized that it really couldn't make the living for me that I would want even if I became a concert pianist.
Speaker 1: Now how did you get to Carnegie Hall [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well I was--
Speaker 1: Practice, practice, practice (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I attended the New York School of Music, and it was their concert that they sponsored at Carnegie Hall and I, I was one of about six students who appeared at Carnegie Hall in their behalf.
Speaker 1: And Carnegie was a man who had done--who had really donated a lot of time--
Speaker 2: Andrew Carnegie.
Speaker 1: --for different black causes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 343956
Speaker 1: Moving forward, let's talk about your early school years.  Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: In the Bedford [Bedford-Stuyvesant] section of Brooklyn [New York], Public School 3 [P.S. 3, The Bedford Village School, Brooklyn, New York].  I would say that my class was I would say 30 percent black, 70 percent white.  And my teacher, my eighth grade teacher, recommended me to the High School of Music and Art [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York] which was a special school at that time that had been initiated or started by one of the mayors in Brook- in New York City [New York, New York], but it was a very special school.  It only chose musicians or artists and you had, had to take an examination in order to be accepted so I was accepted as a result of taking the examination and I passed.  So I was there for four years, graduated and then I had one year at Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York] and then I got married.
Speaker 1: So what type of a student were you?
Speaker 2: I think I was a, a fairly good student.
Speaker 1: What about extracurricular school activities?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a girls club that we formed and we even decided to become part of the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], and they permitted us to form a basketball team so we played basketball.
Speaker 1: Was the YWCA segregated?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It was?
Speaker 2: Yes, at that time it was.  But then it soon became integrated.  I would say during my time it did become integrated.
Speaker 1: So starting with the YWCA with the basketball team was an all-black girls basketball?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah well that was our social club--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and we just wanted a club of us.  So we had a good time not only with the basketball thing but we gave parties and we invited boys to our parties and we had a good social time.
Speaker 1: As far as dating boys, what sort of rules had your mother [Elvira Lord Forster] laid out for you?
Speaker 2: Well she didn't want me dating anybody too, too soon.  She thought that sixteen was good enough (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were there any rules about the type of boys you could date?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  Just somebody who was upstanding and, and had a good reputation.
Story_ID: 343957
Speaker 1: So you met your husband [Albin Bowman], your first husband then in high school [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York] you said or college at the Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York]? You met in college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was it--the meeting story, was it an interesting one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess so.  But that was just for a short period of time.
Speaker 1: Right.  And then you met and married?
Speaker 2: John Procope.
Speaker 1: Procope.  And how did you meet Mr. Procope?
Speaker 2: He was a blind date.
Speaker 1: Set up by whom?
Speaker 2: A friend of mine.
Speaker 1: Who is the friend?
Speaker 2: Virginia Carter [ph.], who is deceased at this point.
Speaker 1: How did you know Virginia Carter?
Speaker 2: How did I meet Virginia?  At a Presbyterian conference.
Speaker 1: So not only were you a church member, but you attended church conferences?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that's right.
Story_ID: 343958
Speaker 1: We were talking about Virginia setting you up on this blind date [with John Procope].
Speaker 2: Virginia Carter [ph.] suggested that I meet a friend of hers and she sent him to my home one evening and he rang the bell and I, I had another friend present because I wanted her to check him out as well, not only Virginia.  I was impressed with him.  He was a very, he was about 5'9", very slim and what can I say about him?  He was employed by Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn [BBDO Worldwide] as an advertising executive and he was a lot of fun (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You should probably throw in at this point that I mean that if we're gonna talk about his career, you should just say that he was the first African American or at that time they called Negro to have such a position within an advertising agency.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, as a marketing specialist, I think that was his title.  John Procope was a marketing specialist with Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn.  I think he was the second black.  Clarence Holte [Clarence L. Holte] was the first.  And he did well in that position, although he wasn't satisfied.  He felt that he really couldn't move up because he was black and if he were white he certainly would have moved up faster.
Speaker 1: Especially in the advertising business--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which was extremely white at the time.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Which is pretty white today still.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I'm just trying to think we have [HistoryMaker] Byron Lewis who is an out--outstand--who runs an outstanding advertising agency [UniWorld Group, Inc.] and we knew Byron way back there too.  In fact Byron and John worked for Leonard Evans [W. Leonard Evans Jr.] when he owned Tuesday magazine.
Speaker 1: So going back to the blind date, you meet him on the date--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --where does he take you?
Speaker 2: He took me to meet a friend of his that evening.  And the friend that--the friend lived in Queens [New York] and his girlfriend was there at the time and we all went out for dinner and dancing at that time.
Speaker 1: Where did you go dancing?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of where we went.  Some place in Queens.  I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Was it a notorious black big dance club?
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Nothing like the Savoy [Savoy Ballroom, New York, New York] or the--yeah (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was, it was rather sober (laughter).

Speaker 1: What were you doing at the time professionally because you were in Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York] but what were you doing for work at the time?
Speaker 2: What was I doing for work at the time?  Well, you recall my first husband [Albin Bowman] was in the real estate business and it was through him that I became an insurance broker.
Speaker 1: So how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, if he owned houses, they had to be insured.  And this happened just around the time that he passed.  So in 1953, I formed my own insurance brokerage agency [E.G. Bowman Company, Inc., New York, New York].  But I had been an insurance broker prior to that time.  I became incorporated at that time, later on.  So at that time we were insuring brownstones in Brooklyn [New York] and also writing automobile insurance for people who owned vehicles.  Most people who were homeowners did own a vehicle so we were able to do both things at the same time.  And then we became involved with church insurance because I knew a lot of the outstanding colored ministers at that time.  And we, we, we wrote quite a few of the outstanding black churches in Brooklyn insofar as insurance was concerned, property, casualty.  Then it became very difficult.  It was during the latter part of--during the late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: But before we get to the late '60s [1960s] you--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --then you and your first husband split up but you maintained--
Speaker 2: No, he died.
Speaker 1: He died, okay.  And you maintained the real es- you maintained the insurance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, just the insurance business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now had real estate changed at that time?  Because he'd become a broker, was he--
Speaker 2: But he used to buy and sell his own properties.
Speaker 1: Buy and sell his own?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So that allowed him to avoid these no colored--these offices that--
Speaker 2: Remember that was--
Speaker 1: --with your mother [Elvira Lord Forster]--
Speaker 2: That was years ago with my mother.
Speaker 1: --but things have changed.
Speaker 2: Things changed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Things changed.
Speaker 1: So you started--you were running your own insurance?
Speaker 2: I used to--I used to just handle insurance for the houses that he owned at that time.
Speaker 1: And then he passed away?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were--
Speaker 2: But in '53 [1953] I went all out for insurance because I, I became more interested in that subject than real estate.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I really can't give you a reason why.
Speaker 1: Was it money?
Speaker 2: I think perhaps it was more challenging because I became involved with handling small corporations in Brooklyn and at that time L.B. Johnson's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], LBJ.  LBJ's, LBJ's War on Poverty was becoming popular and you had a lot of community corporations in Brooklyn that needed insurance.  You had an agency called TRY, Training Resources for Youth [Training Resources for Youth, Inc., Brooklyn, New York].  We had the Bedford-Stuyvesant Youth in Action [Bedford-Stuyvesant Youth in Action, Inc., Brooklyn, New York].  I'm trying to think of another group that we had.  There were three outstanding groups in Brooklyn and they all selected me to do their insurance for them.  And I became more and more involved in commercial insurance as a result of that.  That gave me the experience to get involved with major corporations, because the same types of coverages that we would write for these community corporations in Brooklyn were the same types of coverages that major corporations also needed.  So I became familiar with the basics or the fundamentals of, of that type of coverage.

Speaker 1: What happened when you leave--you, you're--at the same time you're doing this, you're attending Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I'm finished, that's it.
Speaker 1: No, you're finished with Brooklyn--
Speaker 2: That's it.  That's it.
Speaker 1: That's it.  Okay so now you're full--
Speaker 2: That's it.  I'm married, my husband [Albin Bowman] is deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay you're married and your husband is--so you are a full time real estate--
Speaker 2: I'm in the insurance business [through E.G. Bowman Company, Inc., New York, New York].
Speaker 1: --I mean, insurance business, entrepreneurial at the time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because you opened your own--who and you so the ministers were black churches made up a big part of the business.  Tell me how it developed into bigger, you reaching out beyond just the black churches, the black businesses, how did it spread out?
Speaker 2: Well as time goes by you make contacts as, as you grow.  I guess--
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess what I'm getting to is there's the, there's the riots and the--
Speaker 2: That was the late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Mid-'60s [1960s].  There were the riots and the threats of riots in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] as I recall and insurance companies were canceling insurance right and left.  And one day I had over ninety cancellations of insurance from one insurance company and I was really at a wit's end as to what to do.  And on that particular day I had an appointment to witness a cere- swearing in ceremony of a friend of mine who was being made some kind of a commissioner and I forgot what it was at Mr. Rockefeller's [Nelson Rockefeller] office, he was then governor and I had the pleasure of introducing myself to the governor and explaining to him my problem in Bedford-Stuyvesant and not only was it my problem, but there were other brokers throughout the state who had the--a similar problem because it wasn't only Bedford-Stuyvesant, it was any black area in the State of New York including Buffalo [New York], Sara- Saratoga [New York], Harlem [New York, New York].  So we all had problems and I asked him if he would look into this and see what we could do.  Bottom line was the state legislature passed a law stating that insurance could be bought by anybody who owns property in these areas or any area within the State of New York that insurance companies didn't want.  What happened was it provided for, for insurance companies to act as one whole as a group to participate in writing insurance in areas that they called undesirable.  And that became law and people then were able to obtain insurance.
Speaker 1: And before that, they--it was called--was it called the redlining?  That the--
Speaker 2: Well, that word has been used in the insurance industry.  They don't like the word.  The industry doesn't like it, but that's what it was.
Speaker 1: So basically when--I don't understand the cancellation part, if you can help me with that.  They were able to cancel black people's insurance because--
Speaker 2: Well, don't say black people's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's assume that you lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant and you owned a piece of property and you came to me to insure it.  I would call an insurance company and ask them to place the risk for me for you, and they would perhaps keep the risk for a year or two or whatever and things, riots were happening and what not and the insurance company said to me we can't stay on his insurance any more.  We, we've gotta cancel it, because the risk is too great.  So that's how the cancellation situation occurred as a result of the threats of riots in Bedford-Stuyvesant and other areas within our state.
Story_ID: 343961
Speaker 1: Do you know when you went from being Bedford to Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York], and how did the community develop from being when you were initially there, three black families to I'm presuming a larger number of blacks at insurance companies?
Speaker 2: I guess you had more migration from the South and from the West Indies and they came into Bedford, Bedford--they came into the general area and they--it spilled over into, into the Stuyvesant area so then they grouped them all together and called it Bedford-Stuyvesant.  But the Bedford section is closely, it is very close to Stuyvesant.  Bedford Avenue is, is the name of the street and Stuyvesant Avenue is the name of the street so therefore and I would say they were about ten blocks apart running parallel to each other.
Speaker 1: So within those two blocks were what made up the community?
Speaker 2: More than two blocks.
Speaker 1: I mean within--I mean those two streets.
Speaker 2: That area.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, made up the area of what would be known to be known as Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I can give you the boundaries if you want.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: I would say that Bedford-Stuyvesant started at about Classon Avenue in Brooklyn [New York] and went all the way--they're running parallel to each other and would run I would say to Patchen Avenue and that would be--that would--and it would start with Myrtle Avenue at one end and Eastern Parkway on the other end.  And that would be Bedford-Stuyvesant.  It's a big area.

Speaker 1: At that time there in the '60s [1960s], there was a lot going on within the country as far as race relations.
Speaker 2: There was what?
Speaker 1: A lot going on within the country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --as far as race relations I mean, the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Of tho- those were the civil rights days and the ministers were very active, Gardner Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor], Milton Galamison, those were the two outstanding ministers in Brooklyn [New York] who really did a terrific job in so far as civil rights are concerned.
Speaker 1: What did you see as your role?
Speaker 2: Employing black people, making jobs for them.
Speaker 1: And how did you go about doing it?
Speaker 2: Well I had a business [E.G. Bowman Company, Inc., New York, New York] and I needed, I needed professional help.  I needed clerical help and at that point we had also gained--this is the early '70s [1970s] now.  We had--we were awarded the business for the New York City Human Resources Administration [New York City Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services] to write all of the insurance, all of the community corporations at twenty-six community corporations across the city for the daycare centers and for the senior citizens centers throughout the City of New York [New York].  So we had to really get ready to revamp in order to service this account. Not only did we write the insurance coverages, but we were the administrators.  We acted as the insurance department for the New York City Human Resources Administration.
Speaker 1: That's a big--
Speaker 2: And so we hired a lot of competent, we thought black people and also Hispanics.
Speaker 1: And at that time, I mean given that you were just starting out or--
Speaker 2: Well I wasn't starting out at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay you were in the thick of it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was it hard to find African Americans to employ?
Speaker 2: Yes, very difficult.
Speaker 1: How did you go about doing that?
Speaker 2: I guess I, I happened to be lucky.  I let the word be known that I was looking for certain types of help and the insurance manager of PepsiCo was instrumental in helping me to find people.  In fact I, I hired a very competent person as a result of his recommendation, James Drake [James E. Drake], who worked for us oh I would say for about ten years.  He became a CPCU, a chartered property and casualty underwriter.  A well versed in the, in the field of insurance.  James now is in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  He left us about ten years ago.  But he was a terrific insurance person.
Story_ID: 343963
Speaker 1: And at the time when you--was this at the same time that you had the storefront in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York]?
Speaker 2: James Drake [James E. Drake] was with us then, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So where were you before you actually had the storefront?  Where were you doing business [as E.G. Bowman Company, Inc., New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never.  That's where I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started?
Speaker 2: Right there.
Speaker 1: Did you own that building?
Speaker 2: Yes, sold it to Al Vann [Albert Vann].  You know Al Vann?  He's--he was an assemblyman.  He's now a city councilman but he's an outstanding politician in Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: So you owned that storefront in Brooklyn and you did business there for a number of years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How had you seen the community change from when you were a child to what it was when you owned that storefront?
Speaker 2: It was a terrific change.  It was basically a homeowner community when I--when we started there.  Blacks took pride in their homes and they, they were, they were substantial homeowners and then you had a large migration of people into Bedford-Stuyvesant who were not necessarily the homeowner type, they--a lot of them were on welfare and many of the apartment buildings that were previously occupied by white people were occupied by, by welfare tenants and so the neighborhood began to change, because well you know the situation.  I don't think I have to describe it.
Speaker 1: But just simply for the sake of this interview, will you briefly describe--?
Speaker 2: Well if you owned your home for fifteen years and then the apartment building on the corner has selected nothing but welfare tenants, they don't take pride in their home, in, in, in their living as, as you the homeowner would and it, it's very discouraging to a homeowner.
Speaker 1: So did that cause the--
Speaker 2: The economics of the, of the area changed as a result and many of the black people who owned property there moved out and bought property in Queens [New York] and Westchester [Westchester County, New York].
Speaker 1: And then a--Jamaica developed?  Jamaica, Queens [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's St. Albans [Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: St. Albans.  Okay.  So how long did you stay in the neighborhood?  Did you see it as a, as--how did you see it staying in the neighborhood with your business?
Speaker 2: Well, we were there for a long time.  I, I moved when we--when my husband [John Procope] and I got married in '54 [1954] but I was in Bedford-Stuyvesant up until that time.
Speaker 1: And when you left Bedford-Stuyvesant, where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to a town called Malba [Queens, New York].  I bought--we bought a piece of vacant property, and we built a house.
Speaker 1: And is that in Long Island [New York]?
Speaker 2: That's in Queens.
Speaker 1: Queens okay.  And you decided to build there as opposed to--but you kept your business--?
Speaker 2: In Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Speaker 1: In Bedford-Stuyvesant.  Now were you writing a lot of insurance policies for the community in Bedford-Stuyvesant (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Bedford-Stuyvesant?  Oh yes.
Speaker 1: That was the bulk of the business?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 343964
Speaker 1: And then from that it [E.G. Bowman Company, Inc., New York, New York] developed into--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Fortune 500 companies?
Speaker 2: Well from that we decided, well we found it difficult to attract the business of major corporations in Brooklyn [New York].  Very often the risk managers, he is the person who handles the insurance portfolio for a specific corporation, would be reluctant about coming into Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] to see us and so it was James Drake [James E. Drake] and Harry Ennevor who's here with me now and John Procope who decided to go to Manhattan [New York] to see what we could find in 1979.  And we came upon this location right here and we felt that it was important for us to be in Manhattan because it's close to the insurance market place and we would not have a problem with white risk managers coming to our office to see us.  They could come right here, and it would be safe in quotation marks.  So we moved from Bedford-Stuyvesant to Wall Street in 1979 and we been here ever since.
Speaker 1: How did you feel about the move?  Were you sad to leave the Bedford-Stuyvesant community?  Did you feel you were--
Speaker 2: We kept the office open there for about two years.
Speaker 1: So it was more or less of an expansion as opposed to a--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.  What we did was we took space in the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation [New York, New York] building.  We felt that we should not leave there completely so we, we took space at Restoration and then we decided to give that up and have the entire operation right here.  We, we, we brought our personal lines, personal lines would be insurance on your home, insurance on your automobile.  We call that personal lines and that's what we did mainly in Bedford-Stuyvesant and many of the homeowners were very happy to see us make the move and stayed with us and did not leave.  So we were very happy that we were able to convince them to maintain their business with us.
Story_ID: 343965
Speaker 1: So in the '70s [1970s] also, you were named Woman of the Year?
Speaker 2: By--
Speaker 1: By?
Speaker 2: Leonard Evans' [W. Leonard Evans Jr.] magazine Tuesday and it was--the award was given to me by Mrs. Nixon [Pat Nixon] at the White House [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Do you remember the experience of going to the White House to meet--to receive the award?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was quite an honor.  And I, I, I was, I was most impressed with Mrs. Nixon, she was very cordial, very kind, very nice and I think we had tea.  But it was a very pleasant experience.
Speaker 1: How would you say business has been for you, and I'm speaking about I mean as an African American and as a woman, the insurance business?  Is--are there other (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's tough.  That's all I can tell you.  And I don't you know being black and being a black woman doesn't bother me at all.  It's just tough being black period, trying to obtain new business.  In the '70s [1970s] as a result of affirmative action, the door would open for you.  Of course you would have to prove to these people you could do the job and they would permit you to, to handle their business.  Today there's no such thing as affirmative action and the doors are not open as they were in the early '70s [1970s] so it's very difficult to obtain corporate business today because they're not interested in doing business with you necessarily.
Speaker 1: So things have changed and not for the better (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Things have changed horribly.
Speaker 1: So as a--I mean affirmative action then was a positive as a result of--
Speaker 2: Affirmative action was a door opener for us.  It didn't give us the business.  It permitted us to get in the door.  Today, the doors are not open.  Some of them are ajar and you can get in but most of them are closed tight.
Speaker 1: How do you open those doors then?
Speaker 2: Well we have all kinds of presentations that we make.  We try to see the chief executive officer if we can.  If we don't we'll see the man who's in charge of insurance, and he does not necessarily want to be bothered with you because he's very happy with the big boys who handle his account and he is very comfortable with them and he'd rather that you not bother him.  Just leave him alone.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: But we keep on pursuing.
Story_ID: 343966
Speaker 1: In the '80s [1980s] your husband [John Procope] came on board--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --to work with you [at E.G. Bowman Company, Inc., New York, New York].
Speaker 2: He was a publisher of the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News].  He sold his interest I believe in 1982.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your just a little bit about your personal lives when he was the publisher of the Amsterdam News, what was--what was that like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it was so--very often his connections with the Amsterdam News made it easy for me to get business.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any sort of big stories that happened during that--during his run at the Amsterdam News that things that he would possibly come home and talk about or?
Speaker 2: I can't remember specifically about anything--specific stories.  If you give me a little time perhaps I can think of some.
Speaker 1: I mean I'm, I'm just throwing things out but remember the big blackout in New York City [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and or even just what do you consider--or what did he talk about as his mission with the Amsterdam as--for the Amsterdam News?
Speaker 2: Economic integration.  He felt that this was the answer to the black problem insofar as economics were concerned.  He felt that we had to be economically independent and try to, try to become involved in white America.  But he believed in, in, in economic independence and fought for it.
Speaker 1: And you were doing the same thing with your company--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so that was a good match.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now did he also have the same issues as you getting, employing as many African Americans as--
Speaker 2: Well I think people are attracted to the media for some reason.  It's, it's more glamorous than the insurance business.
Story_ID: 343967
Speaker 1: In fact I wrote an article back in 1979 for an insurance publication and the title of the article I believe said, "Insurance Isn't Glamorous" and that's why we can't find the kind of help that we need, and this is not only for black people, this is both black and white.  Nobody does anything about educating young people as to what the insurance business is all about.  What the insurance industry is all about.  And I blame the industry for not doing anything about it because we do not have talented people coming up through the ranks from the time they enter high school, they say to themselves I wanna be involved in insurance because it's a very interesting industry and it employs not only insurance people, it employs almost every phase of business you could think of.  Administration, finance, everything that you would want to run a business, the insurance industries employs.  But the industry does nothing to attract young people to the business insofar as education is concerned.  I think they need to get involved with the whole educational system throughout the country where perhaps they could introduce to the, to the powers that be about making insurance part of the curriculum and even lecture on the subject concerning insurance.  To teach young people from the time they enter high school as to what insurance is all about.  Most young people think in terms of automobile insurance and that doesn't mean anything.  It means accidents or life insurance and that means death.  But the business is very glamorous and they need to talk about it, the industry does, and they don't.
Speaker 2: So when you were and I'm just going back to I mean I've done some other research on just insurance and things that I know and maybe you can just comment on if they relate to your business--insurance business or not, but I read once that in the South that they when black people went to the hospital, they you know, that they you know there were no companies that whereas you can get Blue Cross and Blue Shield [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association] for African Americans, you--that there were only you know if you went to the hospital, there was no insurance company that was backing you up saying that--
Speaker 1: Not only for blacks but for whites if you didn't have health insurance back then.  I didn't see you talking about life insurance.  Life insurance, the insurance companies used to discriminate against black people and North Carolina Mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] started in the late 1800s to write insurance for black people across this country.  Metropolitan Life [Metropolitan Life Insurance Company] would not write and neither would the other insure.  If they did, they would write you the premium up higher than it would be for some other person your age.  There was discrimination no question about it in the life insurance end of the business.  I think they used to write industrial insurance like twenty-five cents a week or something and they could--they would send somebody to your house to pick up this twenty-five cents a week insurance.  I remember that as a little kid.  But that was the only type of insurance that they might write for you but it would be rated up higher if they did write it at all.

Speaker 1: Did your mother [Elvira Lord Forster] and father [Clarence Forster] live long enough to see you as an entrepreneur and to start business [E.G. Bowman Company, Inc., New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what did they think about it?
Speaker 2: They were very pleased with that.  Sorry that I didn't stick with the music but I had to eat.
Speaker 1: So they were very please seeing what you done?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You've also been called the First Lady of Wall Street.
Speaker 2: The president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] did that when I received the honorary doctorate.  He was the one who gave me that label.
Story_ID: 343690
Speaker 1: Continuing, First Lady of Wall Street.  You also have the oldest and you correct me if I'm wrong, the--is it the oldest or the only African American owned and operated business on Wall Street?
Speaker 2: No.  I guess we [E.G. Bowman Company, Inc., New York, New York] were the first here but you have Beal [HistoryMaker Bernard Beal] who's just across the street, he had--he's an investment banker and he is on Wall Street.  But you have many investment bankers--black--here in, in the general Wall Street area.  I'm sure there must be about eight or nine companies operating in this general area.
Speaker 1: Is there a community?
Speaker 2: No there isn't.  I don't know why there isn't but if, if there is they haven't invited me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, you're the first lady, if there's a community you'd be invited.
Speaker 2: Well, I should be but maybe they have a problem I don't know.
Speaker 1: Well, do you wish for a community?
Speaker 2: I think it's terrific.  I think we--there's a lot of information that we can exchange, a lot of information that can be helpful to each other.  I think it's very important that we talk to each other.
Speaker 1: So there is--I guess there's not--that is some of your hopes then?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I would like to see any--anyone involved in financial services.  I think that we should all be involved at least on a once a month basis to talk about the situation.
Speaker 1: How have you seen things change within the financial industry services?
Speaker 2: Well, I've seen, and its--I like the change when I see people like Ken Chenault being made chairman and CEO of American Express [American Express Company].  Then I see Dick Parsons [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons] being made chairman and CEO of Time Warner [Time Warner, Inc., New York, New York].  I think it's just wonderful and the gentleman [Stanley O'Neal] who runs Merrill Lynch [Merrill Lynch and Co., Inc., New York, New York] it's all wonderful and, and, and it's terrific and I only hope that they don't forget that they're black.
Speaker 1: And by that you mean you hope that they--?
Speaker 2: Well, the point is they must understand that they must welcome us, we as business people who can do business with them to be part of their operation.  They can't close the door because they're black and have become white and many of them have.  I say no more.
Speaker 1: So what do you think we can do to change like that?  How do things like that change?
Speaker 2: Knock 'em in the head.  (Laughter) You see when you begin to operate a business that is worldwide you, you become in, in--you become involved with the, with the economics of the world, of the country and sometimes you forget that you're black and that there are some people down here who can be an asset to you if you'll just listen to them.
Story_ID: 343691
Speaker 1: How important do you feel history is?  The history of our (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think his--history, history is very important.  I think it's important for our young people, especially to learn something about who we are and where we came from.  And I think the sad thing that I have seen is that many young people do not even know who Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was and that's sad and I think that history can certainly be an asset to black people in general.  I think that you're doing a good job of, of bringing people together who are helping to make history, but when I hear that there's some young people who do not know anything about Dr. Martin Luther King, it's very distressing to me.
Story_ID: 343692
Speaker 1: What are your hopes for Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] or Bed-Stuy as it's called now?
Speaker 2: I hadn't really thought about that.  I, I think if people would think in terms of being homeowners as they used to be at one time, that it would certainly be an asset to black people but first you have to get rid of that welfare mentality.  You have to be a part of economic mainstream.  You gotta become educated.  You have--your children have to be educated and, and become involved in what's happening in America and I think if we can reduce the welfare rolls, we will really--it will be helpful to us all.
Speaker 1: Well how do you feel, because I also read that Bed-Stuy now is becoming gentrified?  And that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is it?  Who's doing that?
Speaker 1: --well--who's doing it as far as I mean--well people, white people who want to buy homes and--
Speaker 2: You know like LBJ's [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] wife was--believed in gentrification and she took the bull by the horns and did it.  I forgot her first name, Mrs. LBJ [Lady Bird Johnson].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I was just wondering if there was somebody in Brooklyn [New York] who was really leading the parade on that subject?
Speaker 1: And I don't know if there are any specific people, it didn't say in the article or in the description, but what it talked about was when that happens it prices out the poor people who have lived there for--
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: Is it--because you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can't discuss the subject because I don't know anything about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.

Speaker 1: So moving on, what are your hopes for the African American community in general?
Speaker 2: To be involved in economic mainstream America.  It's quite a goal I realize that but we have to start first with education and we have to start number two about reducing the welfare rolls because it serves as a poor image as black people are concerned.  They must learn to be productive and you gotta start with your children.  You gotta see to it that they go to school, stay in school, learn something and whether they go on to college or not is another subject, but at least be proficient in whatever they decide they wanna do.  But they have to be economically independent and become a part of economic mainstream America, that's the only way you're gonna be accepted.
Speaker 1: How do you feel we are now versus what, versus where we were in the '60s [1960s]?  Have we come a long way or are we still having a really long--
Speaker 2: Well it looks like we're retrogressing.  And the thing that bothers me is that during the '60s [1960s] we had the leadership of the outstanding ministers in the New York City [New York, New York] community.  They really took a hand in that whole subject of, of integration and civil rights but I, I see no leadership here at all and I'm, I'm very, very distressed about that.
Speaker 1: Who do you think should take up that role now?
Speaker 2: I think it should be done by the ministers.  They're the one who control or, or who have access to black people across this city.  People do go to church here.  I think it's, it's one means in order--it's one way to communicate with black people is through the church.  And we certainly did it in the '60s [1960s].  There's no reason why we can't do it now but they've gotta come up with an agenda.
Speaker 1: And what do you feel the agenda should be?
Speaker 2: Economic independence.  Get off of welfare.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  What would you like to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Of having built a productive commercial insurance brokerage firm that can serve not only the New York City [New York, New York] community but the company--the country as a whole.  We are licensed in all states and we're in a position to do business in all states as through Fortune 500 companies, and we're fortunate enough right now to handle quite a few and we don't have enough however, but I would like to see Bowman [E.G. Bowman Company, Inc., New York, New York] as one of the outstanding insurance brokerage firms in this country, if they will let us in.

Speaker 1: When you look back over your career up to this point, what stands out most for you as far as what you've achieved?
Speaker 2: Well I could never have done it without my husband [John Procope] and he, he was a ardent supporter of mine and I miss him.
Speaker 1: And what has been your crowning effort for the accomplishments you have made?
Speaker 2: Be more specific.
Speaker 1: Which of the awards you've received has meant the most to you?
Speaker 2: Gee, I hadn't even thought about that.  I guess the honorary doctorate that I received from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] because I do believe in education and the fact that they recognized me and and bestowed that award upon me, I consider it a wonderful compliment, 'cause education is my thing.

Speaker 1: Do you have one last message you'd like to leave with young children, people?
Speaker 2: Stay in school.  Learn a trade or, or, or whatever your academic interests may be, select one or the other but be proficient in it and be good at it and become economically independent.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you just because we have a few more minutes, what organizations do you believe are doing a good job and that African Americans should support and be a part of?
Speaker 2: You shouldn't ask me that question.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think it's very important that the organizations focus on some of the things that we talked about and I don't think that they have given it the focus that they should give it.
Speaker 1: Well can you leave me with one positive thing just to end this with something that we've done right, something that you're proud of?
Speaker 2: I think it's important for black people to be, to be prepared to enter economic mainstream America and the only way you can do it is by getting a good basic education, stay in school and being productive and being a part of economic--America's economic mainstream--economic mainstream America.
Speaker 1: Well, we thank you very much and you I would like to congratulate you on having a long, wonderful happy marriage and--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --that was--
Speaker 2: Thank you so much.
Speaker 1: --something people should aspire to.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
