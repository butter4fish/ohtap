Derria Byrd: Derria Byrd interviewing Gail Mitchell; March 27, 1995. What
kind of background and family history do you come from?
Gail Mitchell: I am the eldest of four children. We were working class and we
come from a small town in western Pennsylvania.
DB: What were your life experiences that led to your decision to come to
Brown?
GM: I find that question interesting because what type of life experience
(laughs) does someone in high school have? My background--my parents-­
brought me up as somewhat sheltered. At least that was my point-of-view as
a teen-ager. And one of the things that I was looking for was to get away from
home--to be out of reach. I was the eldest and both of my parents were
preacher's kids. So my upbringing was very heavy on religion. And the only
thing that really saved me from being forbidden to go the prom, and go to the
dance, and do all those sorts of things was that they were from two different
denominations. And, as a first child, I was an experiment in upbringing
(laughs) anyway, so it was just really strict and two things primarily led me to
apply to Pembroke--which is what it was in those days; seems like a hundred
years ago. One was that I liked the idea that it was coed, yet still somewhat
separate. I had an aunt who attended Bryn Mawr and she'd wanted me very
much to go there and I resisted (laughs) the idea of going to an all-girls school.
In retrospect, I have different ideas about it than I did at that time, but as a
teen-ager, I didn't want to do that. And Pembroke seemed like it was a good
compromise. And also it was the distance (DB and GM laugh); but it wasn't
that I wanted to get so far away but I didn't want to be an hour's drive from
home, and Pembroke was ten. (laughs)
DB: How was your high school similar or dissimilar to Pembroke when you
arrived--academically and socially?
GM: Well it's a small town high school. And it was dissimilar in that there
were fewer what you would call "high-power" students. Like any high school
there was a good number of them and like many schools a t that time, we
were tracked so that the people that I went to classes with were the same
people over and over again. But when you look at the high school as a whole,
it was much more diverse socially, economically, academically than Brown
was then . There were a good number of people there who took shop and
things like that (laughs) and majored in it. Surprisingly, perhaps, for the kind
of communi ly it was, there was a great emphasis on college <1t that time and

something in a number greater than 80 or 90% did got to college-some kind
of college. Many of them would go to associate colleges or something like that
but there was a great emphasis on post-high school education at my high
school?
DB: Did someone come to your school to talk about Brown or did you do your
own research?
GM: I did research on colleges.
DB: How many did you apply to?
GM: I don't remember exactly. I think maybe five or six. I can name some of
them, so it was five or six, it may have been seven. I don't really remember. I
applied to a college in Pittsburgh. I applied to college in Cleveland. To
Bucknell--I applied to small schools. Brown was the most academically­
competitive school. I didn't even apply to Bryn Mawr (laughs) which would
have been the most academically competitive. But Brown was my choice of
the places that I had applied.
DB: What were your expectations of Brown that made it your top choice?
GM: I think that academic challenge, the diversity of the student body, and
the high-powered reputation affected my impression of it. I expected that all
the students would be brilliant. (DB & GM laugh)
DB: Did you find that?
GM: It's hard to look back on that without bringing in the interim years I
spent as an admissions officer at Brown. I gained a completed different
perspective on that, but as a student coming to Brown, I certainly felt that
most of the students around me had come from more high-powered high
schools than mine. There was a lot of apparent privilege. A lot of kids who
had come from private schools. Many of them from schools where they
boarded. Yea, I think from the point-of-view of a seventeen year-old, that was
what I was looking at. (laughs)
DB: When you were attending Brown, how common was it for your
immediate family members to have attended college?
GM: Immediate family members. Well I was the eldest child. My two
grandfathers had gone to college and my parents--my mother had not
attended college, my father had attended college on kind of a night school
kind of basis and had not graduated. But there were plenty of college
graduates in my extended family . And I think I mentioned earlier about my
aunt who went to Bryn Mawr; she was probably my nlClsl close role model in

Mitchell

terms of what to do and what could be done. My father was one of twelve
children. So there were a number of his siblings who would got to college.
One was a nurse of and of course one was a minister (laughs). But they had
various of experiences but she was the one who had been brilliant--I mean
literally, you know. And that was what was my role model. I wasn't looking
to what had happened in my immediate family. It was like, "Look what
Joyce did, that is what you are going to do."
DB: Was it a personal push toward education or was it always assumed that
after you went to high school you would go to college?
GM: It was a given in my family for the generation that I was in that
everybody was going to go to college. Or at least that is what your goal was. It
was very definite that we saw education as a way of freeing yourself from the
constraints that were very much felt and apparent on blacks in the 50s and
60s which is the time when I was growing up.
DB: What are the things which you remember most fondly about Brown or
Pembroke?
GM: Fondly? (laughs) Probably the most "fondly is the people that I met and
the friendships that I had. A couple of professors I remember very fondly as
well. To be specific, John Ladd, who was my philosophy professor and who
asked me to be an undergraduate teaching assistant during my junior year.
He had a great influence on me and he was just really a nice man. And there
were other professors whom I think fondly of: George Bass was one of them.
I had a very broad experience at Brown. Mine was the class that came in after
Ira Magaziner had made all those changes or had done what had caused the
changes to made in the curriculum. And I really did take advantage of the
curriculum's openness to the extent that I took a lot of varied courses so... And
I had a wonderful experience in terms of professors, even in.. .! took a physics
course which was far up field from my area of specialty (laughs) but I think
fondly of my physics professor who had to kindly think of me as a non­
science type. But also my friends. And particularly my roommate. I think
fondly of the development of that friendship .
DB: What would you say were the low-points of your experience?
GM: The way memories work, you only remember the things that were the
best. And the best are the high-points and the frivolous--I shouldn't say
frivolous ... As a young person and not really having that many worries in the
world, the most .crushing thing that happened to me was an incident with a
boyfriend. Seriously. That was probably the low-point. But it had a silver
lining as well; he had already graduated and we'd had a falling out over a
very serious rna tter and I just couldn't believe that I wasn't going to be
spending the rest of my life with him and the benefit, I suppose, is that after I

Mitchell

broke up with him--and that was after my sophomore year--I became a much
more serious student. I thought my life had ended. That doesn't really relate
so much (laughs) to being at Brown, but that was the low-point which had, I
think, a benefit on my academic career. Not that I hadn't been a serious
student before that; but after that I didn't really want to hang out; I didn't
want to do anything but study. It was a low-point and I remember that
summer after Professor Ladd asked me to be his student assistant, he had
given me a large group of materials to work on over the summer. And I did
that with great energy and really prepared well for what I had to do, but it
really didn't have anything to do with the time I spent at Brown.
DB: Where did you live on campus? and off-campus?
GM: I lived at Pembroke for all four years. freshman year, I lived at Morris­
Champlin which was relatively new complex at that time. And I guess
sophomore year, I, with the same group of women who were suite mates
moved into Emory-Wooley which was the same set-up. Then for my junior
and senior years I had a single in Andrews hall. My roommate had moved
into that building as well and I had friends there--it was good.
DB: Did you have units your freshman year where you would have
workshops and different programs during orientation?
GM: No, we didn't have that.
DB: I spoke with a woman in the class of '69 and she said that her freshman
year, all the black women had singles.
GM: Hmm, that's interesting.
DB: There was segregation racially and religiously.
anything like that?
GM: No, my

you were told.

I think she was Catholic. I don't know--did you say religious
well--I think that by that time, they had done away with all to
I've never even heard of that.

DB: Were there any clubs or organizations which you participated in?
GM: Organizations...I saw that question and it caused me to pause and reflect.
I was never a real joiner. I belonged to the black studen ts' organization and I
was active in the theater which involved organizations but not in the sense
of joining a club. There was black theater--which was the theater groupo-and
white theater, probably because of some of the course work I was doing, I

Mitchell

tried out for some of those plays. Umm... (pause).. .I can't remember anything
else.
DB: What type of work of social interactions did you have?
GM: I had work study. The job I had as an undergraduate teaching assistant-­
I can remember whether it was paid or not. I think I didn't work when I was
at Brown other than that. I think that the undergraduate teaching assistant
position was paid because I remember being able to pay someone to type my
papers after that. (GM & DB laugh) And I think that was the source of that
money. On the other hand, I worked in the summers when I was in college,
if that is the kind of work you are talking about. And as far as social, did you
mean social organizations or social...
DB: Social organizations, what sort of bonds brought people together in the
community.
GM: I don't know how to answer that. I would meet people in different
contexts and become friends with them. There wasn't any formal social
organizations. There weren't any sororities, or at least there did seem to be,
while I was there. And, as I say, I wasn't a joiner. I remember freshman year
that people would play bridge and my roommate and I made a pact never to
learn how to play (GM & DB laugh). That was about it. We did. And I still
haven't learned to play. I went to parties. I had a very active social life at
Brown. I don't think it revolved very much around organizations or
organized kinds of things. Groups of people would get together and go to a
football game or a basketball game or the like. Brown had a really bad football
team the first couple of years I was there. That was when ????? ????? was the
coach. And also there were very few blacks who would play. We would go to
hockey games. My interactions were not limited in social interactions along
certain racial or class lines. It was kind of a tight rope to walk but it was
manageable; I didn't have a problem with it. I was not the type of person
who was usually intimidated by what other people thought, so I did what I
wanted to do. I don't know whether that answers you question ...
DB: How were your strongest friendships developed and at what point
during your college career?
GM: My strongest friendship was with my roommate and that was pure luck.
Even though to look at us and think,
"This is J whi te girl from
Massachusetts and a black girl from Pennsylvania." But we had almost
everything in common. Our experiences were really instructive to us, each
of us, in terms of understanding and accepting across racial lines because she
had two brothers and a sister and so did 1. And we both went to small-town
high schools--and we looked at things almost exactly the same which was
really amazing for her to be what appcZlred to be so different from me. And

Mitchell

that friendship was formed very fast. We did write in the summer before we
came to Brown and we had exchanged photographs so neither of us was
surprised at what we found. But we became very fast friends, and we (GM
laughs) had such great times. I am remembering that once she and I...she had
spent a summer in France. I hadn't come from such a privileged background
as to be able to do that. But I spoke French somewhat fluently. Once we went
out (GM laughs) and pretended we didn't speak English ( GM laughs) and
that we were French. And we would pick up guys--I mean it was fun
(laughs), it was. We just had a lot in common and she was my best friend
while I was at Brown. And I was very much a part of--for lack of a better
description-~the black social scene at Brown. I mean I dated and hung out--I
did not cross racial lines to date--so we were separate a lot but we would come
together at night and talk. Very rarely would I go to a party with her or
anything like that. I guess you could say that we existed in different sub­
worlds of Brown but because we were so close, we brought them together in
terms of our experiences. I had other friends who developed out of the
theater. A lot of...mostly the black students who were my friends and, in fact,
were my very good friends at the time, came from the theater. And I dated a
lot. It was great. (laughs) It was. When I was a freshman, I dated a senior.
When I was a sophomore, I dated a--well, at any rate, I didn't date guys in
my class. They were my friends and I had a lot of guys in my class who were
friends and I had one friend in particular whose name was Ernie Caldwell He
was my friend freshman year. He left Brown to go to a black school. I think
the name was Malcolm X University or something. I missed him and he left
sophomore year and he didn't come back. (pauses) You asked about
friendships--there were others that were remarkable. Most of them were men
(laughs), but I had some women friends, too.
DB: Do you think your college career was affected by the fact that you are a
black woman?
GM: Well it was affected by it in the sense that my whole life was shaped by
that. (pause) I don't know about the academic aspects of it. I think that the
way that racism and racial feelings manifest in a culture is on an individual
basis. I mean there is institutional racism and those kinds of things, of
course. I did not feel the hand of that at Brown--institutional, that is. But, in
terms of individual interactions, some people might be less willing to listen
to you--because you are a woman or because you are black--when you speak
up in class. There was a way of cutting off. Maybe I'm thinking more of what
happened to me in law school, than what happened to me at Brown. But
that has been part of my experience to a limited to a degree. I think most of
the effect was social. It's a historical, cultural, social, and academic thing in
our country that was reflected at Brown. (pause) There is more that I could
say about that; I could go on and on.

DB: What type of interactions did Brown men and Pembroke women have;
was it confined mainly to the classroom?

GM: Brown men and Pembroke women? You're not talking about black
people? You're talking about the University. Well Pembroke died while I
was at Brown, which just means .. .let me put it this way... at the time that I
applied to Pembroke and came to Brown, the separations between Brown and
Pembroke existed on an administrative level. There was a separate dean
structure and separate admissions. Other than that there were co-ed dorms-­
there was a co-ed dorm--and co-ed courses. And you would know until you
went to talk to a dean about a class or about placement for a summer job, that
you went to a different place. So as far as the interaction among students or
even between faculty and not administrators, it was the same place. Also for
the most part, Pembroke was where women lived, which was just a part of
campus with a group of dorms. Also, freshman year--although they had to
quickly do away with this--there was only one curfew. There was one curfew.
And it was for freshman women. (laughs) Which was just too ridiculous to
even think about. But yea, we had to be in by 11 o'clock and they would lock
the door. Of course you could leave, you just had to have an agreement with
one of your friends to open the door. (GM & DB laugh) But that was the
difference. I also remember something about some panty raid. (DB laughs)
Yes! Really a panty raid probably freshman week. I don't even remember
when that was. Do you know what that is?
DB: No.

GM: It was a bunch of guys running into a dorm and storming into rooms
trying to steal people's panties out of their drawers. (DB laughs) It was like a
fraternity thing, but it wasn't for a fraternity. I don't think any black men
did that but when people burst into rooms looking for panties, they didn't
know if it was a black's room or not. (GM & OM laugh) It was just very
strange. But that was an interaction you might not expect or know about.
Other than that, I think that there was a definite stereotype of the men at
Brown who belonged to fraternities. I don't know if they are still that or not.
DB: There were only white fraternities at the time?
GM: Yes, well that is what the stereotype applied to. I think it was my junior
year when the Omega Psi Phi's--the Q's--I don't know what you call it: a line?
A group of pledges? They had that. It was brought in by some black men
from Providence and probably from the interest of some of the students .
There was only solely one class at that time that pledged the Q's and so you
would see a line stomping on the green. But other than that, they were
organizations of white men. They might have had a bla ck member here and
there. And it was really a here and there because I don't think there were
very many black men who were interested at the time. Maybe there was sort

Mitchell

of a mutual exclusion, I don't know. Going to a frat party with lots of beer-I
mean some people like that but--that was definitely alien to what I liked. My
roommate also, she didn't go to frat parties. There was a certain kind of
looking down that we did on that sort of thing. But, in terms of interaction,
people attended, that was part of the social mix.
DB: So would you say in general that the dating scene at Brown in the black
community was pretty good?
GM: I don't know if I can say that. Yes, in my personal experience. But I
think that there were enough black students that dating was possible. It was
tough, as had been explained to me, there were.. .! think that there were like
6 blacks in the senior class and of those six, only one was a woman and none
of those 5 guys dated her or had ever dated her. I don't know; they made
jokes. I knew aIlS of them. And then, the class under them had like 10 or
15 blacks in the class. I don't remember how many in the sophomore class,
but our class had about 30. And then the classes that started coming in after
us had similar numbers, so there was a group of black students there, so
about dating, I would say, "I don't know." But there was enough people to
have a party or to hang out, you know?
DB: Did black men outnumber the women through out the University, or
was it just in the senior class?
GM: I think in my class it leaned toward more even numbers. But I think,
in general, yes, men outnumbered women. I guess (laughs) that's why I say
the dating scene was fine. And there were a lot of good people and very
bright people. According to my previous experience, men certainly weren't
smarter than me . (DB laughs) Seriously! It's still somewhat foreign, but that
was new. And that was different. I liked it.
DB: You said you didn't participate in interracial dating, but did it go on at all
on campus?
GM: It did. As a matter-of-fact, a girl in my class whose first name was the
same as mine, and she hung out at the frat parties. So when I would be
introducing myself to somebody (laughs), I would have to say, "No, not that
Gail." But, they were existent. There was not a whole lot of interracial
dating. And there was a great deal of community pressure against that.
That's not why I didn't do it. I really ... community pressure? I could care less .
But it was not so much that; I think it did have somewhat to do with the
pressure and attention. While at Brown, and not directly from course work,
though somewhat from course work, I became very sensitive to the historical
fact of the acts that have occurred against black women in this country from
the time of slavery . And I de veloped a kind of hostility toward the idea of
interracial dating ju s t b ecause T fe ll l11;1 \ h istory as part of my present

experience. But Brown then, as I think you can agree is the same now, was a
very open place where you could do whatever you wanted to do. And that
applied to the academic, where you could be totally immersed in academics at
the exclusion of the social or you could be only the tip of the iceberg in the
academics--it was a real range. And that range applied to social interactions as
well. You could do whatever you wanted to do and that's one of the things I
appreciated very much about Brown. Politically, as well. I mean, you could
have whatever political opinion you wanted. There was a lot of tolerance.
Maybe that was also a reflection of the time. I think that tolerance was one of
the key things about my experience at Brown and allowed for great variety in
just about every area of life.
DB: What do you think Brown taught or tried to teach you about the role of
women in society?
eM: Well, I don't think there was anything that Brown was trying to teach,
related to that tolerance I was just talking about. But one of the things that
was very evident was a sense of equality for women and men. There were
certain kinds of inequality which reflected in the culture but I never had a
sense of any limitations being imposed on my at Brown and being a woman.
That may, in part, be a reflection of my personality because of the way Brown
iso-that you can take what you want--that it is there for the taking both
academically and socially . . That being a taker allows doors to be opened for
you.
DB: What are you feelings about the merger of Brown and Pembroke in 1971?
Do you think it was good or bad?
eM: Mostly bad. I wonder sometimes, in retrospect, whether the services to
women have been diminished by the merger. Placement services and things
like that but as a student, it wasn't a reality to me that there was a separation
between Brown and Pembroke. Except when I went to look for a job for the
summer of something like that. I didn't really use the deans. Tdidn't really
use the deans--I mean when I was at Pembroke, or whatever--T never talked
to deans. I hardly ever went in that building--the Pembroke administration
building.
DB: How influential were your classroom experiences on what you chose to
do after graduation?
eM: Not influential in any direct way. After graduation, Tend ed up working
as an admissions officer at Brown. I was, at that time, interested in academic
administration working in a college setting. The classroom experience really
didn't inform that interest or decision. T liked the academic experience that I
had here and the setting affected my choice but I knew tha t I was interested in
<1dministration in an academic setting.

DB: Were there any courses on black issues or were black issues integrated
into the overall curriculum at Brown?
eM: (laughs) I don't think very much of the latter as far as integration.
There were black studies coursed, if you want to call it that--black subject
matter. I took two of them. One was with Michael Harper in the English
department which explored black novels and autobiography, I think. It's
hard to remember back that far. But I do remember him encouraging us to
interview elderly people that we knew and spend time with them to put the
historical things we studied into context. I took another course in the
sociology department on black. ..it was more a history course, I think. But
these were not integrated. The courses were part of various departments, not
in a separate black studies department. But in terms of black history being
touched on in any of the other academic courses I took, I don't recall that
happening at all. Maybe it's because of my concentration; I took lots of
philosophy courses. I don't know in what way any kind of black history could
have been brought in to philosophy.
DB: Would you say that you felt any sort of pressure to assimilate and push
your minority or ethnic identity into the background?
eM: I don't know whether I would describe it as pressure, but the sense that
I had of the university was that there was some sort of consensus that all of
the students should be all of the students. But there wasn't a really strong
separatism but, for instance, if I went into the Ratty--now as a student, the
Ratty was not someplace that I hung out or ate (laughs)--I would be
immediately confronted with whether to sit with black students--because
there was a type of segregation--or whether to sit with white students. I sat in
both places. Usually I would just sit with my friends--whether they were my
black friends or my white friends. But I...that's a difficult question for me to
answer other than in terms of how I felt as a student. The sense I had was not
so much assimilation, but "you are a Brown student," and so was everybody
else.
DB: Were finances
paying for it?

(1

large part of your education and how did you go about

e M: Now do you me an 'large part' as in w as it a concern? (DB nods) Yes .
And it was a tremendous struggle for my family to provide me with the
things that were not provid ed by the scholarships I received. And I received
money from Brown and from outside of Brown. But the way Brown handled
il was when they got information that you had other moneys, they just cut
back on the moneys that would be offered you. I think that I had less loans
because of those outside scholarships, but my family had to really try to make
ends meet so that r would have money for things like books, clothes, and

Mitchell

-

11

those kinds of things. But the loans that were taken out on my behalf and by
me were (pause) small in comparison with the loans that I took out to got to
law school. (laughs) So they were quickly paid off. I think it had something
to do with the timing--the late 60s and early 70s--the loans were in smaller
proportions to the grant money. Well, at any rate, it was a concern. Not in
the front of my mind as a student, but it quickly came to my mind when I
graduated and had to start paying back loans. For one thing, it was fortunate
for me that at the time I went to Brown, there was no great emphasis on
(pause) material things. Everybody wore jeans. I mean, you couldn't tell.
There were some people who were very wealthy at Brown but you couldn't
tell them from people like me, who were very poor. And that was just the
way that everybody wanted it. And it was just very unpretentious. You could
tell who had money by the fact that they were going to go the Bahamas for
spring break (laughs) or something like that or skiing in the Alps. But it was
a very good time--if there is ever a good time--to be poor because it wasn't
reflected in a way that anyone could identify... Even now I think you can tell it
by people's shoes. (laughs) It just wasn't like that then. There was no such
thing as Nike, you know? (laughs) So it's--materially--it was just a different
time. Nobody could tell.
DB: Who or what were your suppott networks?
GM: Well, the direct support networks were my friends. My family was a
support, but that was very much a long-distance support. My closest family
support was to my aunt, the one who tried to get me to go to Bryn Mawr.
There was a visiting professor at the Connecticut College for women for a
couple of years while I went to Brown. I don't think she was there all four
years, but she was definitely there my freshman year. But that was only an
hour and a half away--I can't even remember the distance from Brown--but I
could go and visit her and I did, so we became close. The other was my
roommate's family which was an hour and a half away, and they adopted
me. (laughs) So when she went home, I could go home, too. And when
they came to visit, they would come and take me out, too. And when I was
in a play, they'd come and see me; they were my adoptive family. That is
also a fond memory of mine.
DB: A lot of people don't get that with their roommates.
GM: Well, I don't think many people get that at all. Just a lucky situation.
DB: Most people don't even want to talk to their roommates, let along hang
out with their families . (GM & DB laugh)
GM: Well, I don't know what that is a reflection of...but certainly that
experience that I had with my roommate was special, but a number of my
friends a t Brown ha ve had friendships with their roommates a~ well. And

Mitchell

then some people moved out and moved on. I did have other friends on the
floor. As a matter-of-fact, as you asked me earlier something about
friendships. I am just remembering that freshman year, there was a group of
us that were friends. Maybe seven, eight, probably, women, and another
one of them was black--Beverly Armstrong. She is a good friend of mine still,
also. But we liked our roommates (laughs), we hung out with them. We'd
sit up at night, eating peanut and jam and Ritz crackers. So, you know, it
was a good time. And from what you described, it is better than what you are
having. (laughs) Really I don't think that nostalgia--as I said earlier, you
remember the good things and forget the bad. But I don't think nostalgia is
accounting for this difference in our experiences.
DB: I guess Brown is just different now.
GM: Every place is different now. These are different times. But it just seems
to me that that was a pretty good time to be in college. I am remembering the
women (sigh) who were in Morris-Champlin and I mean there
were... everybody's door was open and you would just walk in. When you
would be on your way home, you would just sit down on somebody's bed
and just talk to them. And very much that was the same thing when we
were in Andrew's hall and everybody had singles. People would just have
their doors open to socialize and when they closed their doors, they were
studying. I was a more serious student at Brown... well, more organized,
more a lot of things by the time I was living in a single room. And that's
really the difference.
DB: What do you think you came away from Brown with in terms of
positive self-development? And what do you think, if anything, was
damaging?
GM: Well, I'll take the first question first. The damaging and the negative, I
have to think about. I think that the exposure that I had at Brown was very
beneficial to me--academically and socially. It provided perspective on the
world and a lot of the things that I see now--just because there was such a
broad variety of people at I3rown and certainly extremes on every side in
terms of parts of the counlry and how people grew up and that was
trem endous exposure to me. I had a very strong family background and at
Brown, I guess it was the first time I was exposed to the fact that there were
peopl e who came from families where everybody hates everybody and
nobody's close. I didn't know anything about that. I3ut also in terms of
political perspective, I think that the tolerance that I have now wasn't totally
formed at Brown, but it was strengthened there. The academic excellence
that I3rown was posturing is part of me and part of my background and affects
my expectations and the way that I judge things. There is an emphasis on
excellence that I carry with me that was reinforced from being at Brown.
Damaging? I think that while Brown added a lot--at leas t in the beginning--it

eroded my sense of self, actually. Even though I've said (pause) that there
was a sense of quality so that you didn't notice the lack of support right away.
I carne from a very small high school; there weren't even AP [Advanced
Placement] courses offered. And I had a bit of catching up to do. It's a little
difficult to describe. There were some aspects that I was missing that I think
you were not missing. (pause) But it took me some time to get over that and
perhaps I still carry it with me now--a sense of catching up. But I don't think
it was very damaging. My point of view now is that the things that appear to
you now as difficult or painful are probably things from which you can learn.
And so damaging is probably perhaps too strong of a statement. I mean there
were things that were obstacles to get over but I learned from them. I can't
think of anything else that I would describe as damaging.
DB: What, if anything, do you feel was missing from your Brown education
or your experience at Brown?
GM: 'Missing' is a difficult concept for me to use. You can't have everything,
you know. But two things I can think I would have liked Brown offer and it
did not. One of them is what is offered by smaller colleges which is a greater
in timacy in association with the faculty and with other students. But you
can't have that when you are in a larger school, so it is a trade-off . . The other
(pause) is related to the first and that is more mentoring. (pause) Luckily, I
had some of that when I met John Ladd but I could have easily [gone] through
Brown without any mentors . The deans seemed to me to be there more for
when you had a problem. But I didn't really have problems. And I
understand that there are more problematical things now for freshman.
There wasn't very much of that at all. Hardly any to speak of, but we
managed somehow. That might have been it. Also, there are now or by the
time I left Brown, there were more minority faculty members and women but
I think that there are some role models--and I hate to use that term--but it
speaks for an issue for women and students to have people to use as role
models--for lack of a better description--especially for black students. That was
somewhat remedied--somewhat--in later years. I don't think that went on
while I was at Brown.
DB: If you had it all to do over again, would you change anythin g? [eM
laughs] And if so, what?
GM: You mean about being at Brown or going there, what?
DB:
Would you go to Drown again?
Would you have th e s ame
concentration? Would you .. .spend your time any differently?
GM: I probably would include among my studies, more esoteric thin gs. But
you know, it's kind of tough, you can't.. .I've come to appreciate other things:
like I may have s tudied Chinese or Egyptology. Some things that I.. C1 !" ('ven

Greek. All very useful things (GM & DB laugh). But you can only fit so
much in and I didn't really have an interest in those things until I completed
the things that I did do. But at this point, yes, I think I would try to squeeze
some of that in. And it's...hindsight they say is 20/20. (GM & DB laugh) I
probably would have done more planning or I would do more planning if I
could do it over again. Planning the way kids do now in terms of career
planning. I just was preparing myself and it worked out okay.
DB: When you look back over your Brown years, how do you...
[End Tape 1, Side 2]
GM: OH! I can answer the question more. You asked me about reflecting on
the years at Brown and I said they were growth. I have many pleasant and
fond memories of the years. The important development of myself as an
independent thinking person is attributable to my years at Brown and not
necessarily to the classroom aspects only. But I do believe I benefited
tremendously from that experience and it's not to say that I would not have
benefited from a similar experience at some other place. But it was a good
time to be that age that I was and that you are now. You know that the draft
came around at this time. So it was a tough time too. That was not hanging
over my head but it was hanging over the head of many of my friends. A
couple of them did not accept the call. Some people went to Canada and
some disappeared. It was a tough time, a tough time. But it was much more
exciting and hopeful than today.
DB: Tell me a little bit about what you have been doing since you graduated
from Brown...grad school; career.
GM: Certainly. When I finished my undergraduate work, I worked as an
admission's officer for Brown. And that was a very pleasant experience as
well. One that was very beneficial to me, and one which as I look back on it,
it was a great job. I wouldn't mind having a job (laughs) that I enjoyed so
many aspects of now. The work part of it was more like play compared to the
work part of what I do now.
DB: Did you travel along wi th tha t?
GM: Yes, that was a good portion of what we did was travel. The recruiting
part and the public speaking part are not akin to the courtroom work that I do
now, but they do--or did--draw upon the same kinds of skills. At that time,
Brown sold itself. The travel taught me how to travel. (laughs) How to read
a map. How to land in a city and get a rent-a-car. But that's really here nor
there. It broadened my base of understanding of Brown as an institution.
After doing thJt for a couple of years, I.. .what did I do? '76. I got married and
began la \\· school the same year. I attended Columbia, which is ... Columbia

law school was a tremendous change from Brown; it was enlightening. The
competition and nastiness (laughs) of people is something that I had not
experienced at Brown and was evident there. The Bacce decision ' was made
while I was a student at Columbia. The comments that people made were
just outright racism that people at Brown would not have made because it
was much to gentile at the time that I had been there. I was astounded. It-­
Columbia's in New York City--I mean people there pull no punches. But,
nevertheless, I had a good experience at Columbia as well and made some
very good friends. I had a good academic experience there; I was a very
serious student. After that I had a couple of clerking jobs while I was a
student at Columbia and was exposed to law practice on Wall Street and
decided that I didn't want to do that. My husband and I moved to
Philadelphia where we lived for five years. In that time, if you are asking me
work-wise as opposed to anything else, I worked for a relatively-large law
firm in Philadelphia, which was an interesting exposure. It was a good way
to commence a legal career because of the wonderful support services that law
firms have, if you really want to you can be very thorough and a good lawyer.
And I guess I did. I left that firm called Ballards and Barn and worked for the
city of Philadelphia for a couple of years. Essentially on loan...no not on
loan...as relief from my law firm. The city of Philadelphia had hired a lawyer
from private practice--the mayor I guess had hired someone to be his city
solicitor--recruiting in the law firms: "Come do your public service." And he
was very charismatic and I did it and I loved it. It was wonderful. Much
more responsibility for a young lawyer and it was an all-girls commercial
litigation in the lawyers' unit. And the head of the unit was a woman that I
had been in practice with in the law firm and I guess she brought me in. We
were women lawyers doing construction for the City--multi-million dollar
projects. It was quite exciting; very heady. My son was born during those
years. And we moved to Buffalo when my husband finished his fellowship;
he is a cardiologist. And since I've been in Buffalo I have worked for the state
of New York--mostly for Bob Abrarns--who resigned last...a year ago
December. I took the job mostly because it was part-time and I had a toddl er.
I kept it and it is challenging work. Not necessarily the work of someone
with great ambition. I don't know whether I am reserving that for the next
stage of my career or not but that is the work experience I have had since I left
Brown. And it's not related to anything that I did at Brown. When I left
Brown... when I applied to law school, I did that under the consul of Jackie
????? who was the first woman dean of the University. I had gone to see her
about going ...continuing in academic administration. I went to talk to her
when I was first making plans . And she gave me great advice which led me
to go to law school. She encouraged me to take an academic degree as
opposed to an education degree. And I decided to practice for a while but I
thought that I would go into a university setting and it may be somewhere in
my future. It's not easy to do in Buffalo. (pause) I don't think there is
anymore--whether that's responsive. You said tell you a little bit and I told
you a whole lot. (laughs)

DB: That's actually it for the questions but is there anything else you would
like to say? Comments you would like to share?
GM: No, not really. This is an interesting project that you have undertaken
and I hope that when it is finished, it will be helpful someone somewhere
sometime. It's been interesting for me just to reflect. They say you can't go
home again so you can just reflect. In fact, as you have told me, Brown isn't
the same place that it used to be.
DB: And it also just could be my experience of it. There might be some who
are having the same type of experience you had.
GM: Well, yes.
DB: I would venture to say, "Probably not." (GM & DB laugh) But I guess it
is possible that someone is having a good time at Brown.
GM: I don't know if you want to continue recording this or not, but I am
curious to know about the other women you have talked to. Do they describe
experiences similar to mine?
DB: Yes. Everyone... the majority the [women] I spoke to last semester--the
majority of [whom] were in the class of '73/'74...as well as one in '85 and '26-­
all had a great time at I3rown. There were quite a few people in the seventies
who really liked it.
GM: Right, that's when I was there.
DB: And even this semester, the people I have spoken to enjoyed Brown.
There was only one woman in the class of '69 who didn't have a particularly
good time at Brown.
GM: That could have been because there wasn't necessarily anyone there for
her to hang vvith. Those students that I told you about that I knew were in
the class of '70 in which there was only one woman and I didn't know her
very well. I meJII I knew who she was and some story about her having a bat.
She was a psychology student and she brought a bat home or something.
Those men were rcally a tremendolls bunch of guys. Really. I was really
impressed. And 1 think that even they would describe a more positive
experience than you do. But their social life at Brown was much more
limited than minco It made a big difference. I am trying to remember all of
their names. 1\1..1 t three of them whose names I can remember all became
lawyers--too bild l What a waste. (laughs) What a waste. One of them was a
physicist, too. ;\nd that is truly a waste but he is having a great time as a
lawyer. He had ·, \ · k1. [ would be described as a social conscience. I don't know

whether you want to record this or not one question you didn't ask but I was
just thinking about is the interaction of Brown and people and other Ivy
League schools. There was a considerable amount of cross-colonization there.
And the dating that I described...(laughs heartily) (DB: Here we go! laughs)...
stemmed from other institutions.
DB: I used to ask a question about that but no one seemed have had much
interaction so I axed it.
GM: My experience may have been somewhat different. (laughs)
DB: Even as far as the colleges that are in the general Providence community,
there is a lot of animosity between the black communities at the colleges.
GM: Perhaps. I wasn't talking about colleges in Providence. But in Boston
and actually my contact arose from people that I knew at these other schools.
Otherwise I wouldn't have known them. And there were a couple of guys I
dated at Yale. I think the '70s were probably a very special time. In terms of
the number of black students and other minorities too was somewhat
limited. The communities were small enough so that if you knew someone
at another school, you would have friends in common somewhere else. You
know that sort of thing.
DB: I would even say now that interaction between campuses--be it Ivy
League or just outside of Providence in general--is limited to people who are
probably in sororities and fraternities who travel to different parties. Or if
there is a conference, they'll get together. But I wouldn't say there was too
much interaction, generally.
GM: Now what if you had a friend who came from Buffalo and went to
Wesley, you wouldn't go visit them?
DB: Oh I would. I would.
GM: So tha t is very circumscribed. Something very local.
DB: It just so happens that with my friends: one is in Ohio, one's in Buffalo­
-two actually stayed in Buffalo, one is in Michigan.
GM: That sort of thing allowed me to be other places and meet other people.
And then they would come back and visit Brown at another time and not just
the person that I'd visited. While I was at Brown, one of my friends from
high school ca.me to visit. Now this was a white guy and I visited other
schools like that. And then other people would come visit me. And I forgot
to mention--this is really related to what we were discussing, but--I worked
during th e summe rs when I went to I3rown. The first summer, I work ed

back home in Pennsylvania in a store. The second summer I worked at a rug
treatment place in Boston. [Gail: here I couldn't really decipher what you
were saying. something about that next two summer. I think I heard
something about an educational experience in Boston. Could you please fill
in the details? Thanks, Derria.] It was interesting and it allowed me to go to
Boston often, which many people didn't get to do. And that led to meeting
more people and more crossing between colleges to visit that people I'd met.
One summer--and I got this job through the Brown placement office--my
roommate and I took a job together in Maine as the companions to a very
wealthy woman whose husband had died and who son was working in
Providence and he wanted someone to stay with his mother. But I think he
hired two of us because he thought one of us would get bored and not stay in
the position . (laughs) So he hired us both and that was an enlightening
experience. So we stayed there from the end of May until pretty much the
end of June. I also worked as a nanny for an English couple who were
between nannies.
I think they were waiting for their usual
nanny...something about visa problems, I think. (laughs) But for most of the
summer, we worked for this woman . It was an interesting experience
exposure-wise. The family we worked foro-the woman--what one would call
a 'maverick' among the social scene because she was well-groomed and had
college students stay with her during the summer at her cottage on the
coast.. .5he was fascinating. And she told all kinds of stories . She couldn't
understand the difference in financial background between herself and my
roommate and 1. So we would were jeans and t-shirts and she thought it was
really cool that we did that. But that was all th a t we could afford. (laughs) It
was really very special.
