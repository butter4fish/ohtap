 Finchum  Today is August 8, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in Broken  Arrow to speak with Louise Starkweather, and this is regarding our  Oklahoma 100 Year Life project, so thank you for having us today.  Thank you.  Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  I was born in 1912, November the 30th, and I was born in Du Quoin,  Illinois.  Okay. And what brought you to Oklahoma?  Well, his son is building homes and he asked him to come to Oklahoma  to help him. I was living with him. I lived with him. For fourteen years  they   ve put up with me. Can you imagine that? (Laughter)  So when did you move to Oklahoma?  In 2000     In 2007, wasn   t it?  Eight.  Eight, I believe. Haven   t been here too long.  Well, we   ll go back to when you were a child. Did you grow up on a  farm or in town?  5  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  In town.  What did your parents do for a living?  My father was a miner, coal miner, in a small town in Illinois. He did  mostly   he was a policeman sometime, but he did mostly coal mining.  And your mother, did she work outside the home?  No. No, the women didn   t work hardly at that time outside.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  I had two sisters and one brother.  And where are you in the order?  I had one sister younger and one sister older. Then my brother was the  oldest.  And where did you go to elementary school?  I went to Du Quoin, in the elementary school.  And high school?  I went to Du Quoin, also. I graduated from high school.  Do you remember what year?  It was 1932. It was during the Depression.  That   s what I was going to say. Do you have many stories from that time  period, the Depression days?  I was just thinking, you know, one thing that you didn   t have food at the  school. You had to bring your lunch or go home. You had to walk. You  walked   I lived about, I guess, about three quarters of a mile from  school. You had to walk everyplace. You never rode. I enjoyed school. I  was going to tell you, and maybe you   ll be interested in this. When I  went to grade school the bell would ring for recess, we called it    recess   ,  and there would be fifteen minutes recess. Everybody had to get in line  to march out. You had to leave the building, go out and play, and then  the building would ring a bell again for you to come in. You had to get  in line and march in. You didn   t just scatter and go in. I didn   t know  whether you knew we had to do that. Then you didn   t talk when you  6  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  were in line, you kept your mouth shut. Teachers were there to watch  you. I thought you   d be interested in something like that. (Laughs)  And so at a young age you would walk home for lunch?  Oh yes, you didn   t have lunch any place unless you took it.  Were you usually walking by yourself or have friends?  Oh, friends   everybody walked. If you went to the store you had to  go   if you was going to get a lot of food, you had to take a little wagon  to get your groceries because you couldn   t carry them all. You only went  to a grocery store or a   well it was a company store. The miners had a  company store. You could buy everything there except your   a butcher  shop, you couldn   t buy that in a grocery store, and a bakery shop. That   s  all you   d have at...then you   d buy everything else at   and on paydays  they   d check off what you   d bought at the grocery store. So company  store, I remember that. You got a sack of candy when you paid your  grocery bill, and that   s all the candy you had until the next time you paid  your grocery bill.  So did you hide it from your sisters? Did you hide the candy from your  sisters?  Oh no, no. My youngest sister and I, we just practically were  inseparable. She was just with me all the time. I took her on dates and  everything else. I had to take her everywhere, she didn   t stay home. If I  went on a date, I took my sister.  And what about your older sister, she was different.  Oh yeah, my older sister was   she was her own self. She worked mostly  when I was older. I mean, of course we all had to work. On wash days,  now that was something, on wash days.  Tell us about it.  Well, you had to draw your water out of the well, when I was little. You  had a gallon bucket and you   d draw about   oh, I   d say about ten  buckets full. I mean, ten tubs full of water. You only washed once a  week. Everybody in the neighborhood washed on Monday, practically.  You had to scrub with a board, on a board, and then you had to boil your  clothes, your white clothes. My mother was very particular, and you had  to scrub them on a board after they were boiled to get every spot out of  them. You had a lot of water that you had to use out of a well, which you  had to draw it all out of a well and put it in the thing. Scrub it on the  7  Finchum  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  board, have a wringer that you wrung, put it in the next tub, and rinsed it  and then wring it again. And hung it all on the line. If it was pretty you  just hung it outside, if it was bad you hung it inside. The whole house  was full of clothes when it was bad weather. (Laughter)  Well by drawing water, what do you mean? Pumping?  Oh no. We had to draw it with a bucket, a gallon bucket, with a rope on  it. We had to draw it.  You didn   t have to iron anything did you?  Oh, did I have to iron  (Laughs) We had to iron on a coal stove. You  know, a coal stove, right by it because you had two irons. You had one  on the stove heating and the other one you were using. In summertime  you had to iron right there by the coal stove. You had no air  conditioning, you had no fans, you just had to be hot. You had to  change   and you had to iron everything. My mother ironed, even ironed  the dishrags, the dishtowels, and we had to iron the sheets, the  pillowslips, all your clothes, starched them so they   d stand up  practically, and no wrinkles. I wasn   t allowed to have any wrinkles left  in any clothes, either. I did most of the ironing for them. I was about  twelve I think. I did all the ironing for the family.  And that was unpaid?  Oh yes, we didn   t have the money to pay. (Laughter) And then I used to,  in high school, I did ironing and did some work for some of the  schoolteachers to be able to make a little money just to go to high  school.  Well all that work, what did you do for fun?  Oh, we had fun at night after we got through eating. We called it     supper    then, and dinner was at noon. We played outside in the dirt  road. The neighbor kids would all come and we   d all play until dark and  play    Go Sheepy Go    or    Hide and Seek    or something like that. Then  you didn   t have grass in your yard, because you had the   the kids stayed  in the yard during the day. We used to sweep. My mother used to have  us sweep the dirt, because you beat it down playing you know. So we  swept dirt all the time.  Then your outhouses, you didn   t have an inside bathroom, you went  outside to go, if you had to go outside. Winter or summer you went to  the back house. Everybody had an alley behind their house. Every street  had an alley and a man would come and clean out the toilets and we  8  Bishop  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  called him the    Honey Dipper   . (Laughter) That was   he did that, so  you can imagine what that would be like.  Was it a one-seater or a two-seater, the outhouse?  Oh, the outhouse was a two-seater. Why it was a two seater, I don   t  know. Ours was two-seater. I don   t know why it was because nobody  ever came, but it was a two-seater. It was connected with the coal shed  and all that you had to have. Of course ours was safe, but at Halloween,  if you had one just by itself, that was Halloween time, you had to be sure  and watch your toilet because kids would turn it over on Halloween  time   the toilets. (Laughter) So, we had a time. We had a good time, but  my mother never let me have   we never played cards. She didn   t allow  cards in the house.  Dancing or music?  We didn   t have   well, I remember the first phonograph I heard. It was  tall and my brother bought it. I got up on a chair and looked in it to see  that, but that was all. I must have been about eight or nine years old.  That was the only music. Your lights, you didn   t have electricity. We  had oil lamps. You had about five, and if you had to go to the next room  you had to carry that oil lamp. That chimney had to be washed every  morning because it would get film on it. But you just didn   t have  electricity. You had no air conditioning, you had no fans.  Did everybody have their own bedroom?  No, my sister had a bedroom. We had two bedrooms. There were six of  us. My dad worked in the day, and my brother worked at night, so my  mom and dad slept in the bed in the nighttime and he (my brother) slept  in the daytime in the bed. Then my other sister, she had her bed by  herself, and my younger sister and I, we had a room where we stored  things. We stored a mattress and we   d pull that mattress out every night  and slept in the living room and slept on that mattress. That was the only  bed we had because we only had two bedrooms.  And how was the house heated?  By a coal stove and it was banked at night in the front room. You   d bank  the fire so you had no heat in the house at nighttime. You had to have a  lot of cover on you. Then of course in the wintertime, I mean the  summertime, you just left the windows open. You didn   t have any air  conditioner or anything. The only thing you had was outside heat.  (Laughs)  9  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  Fred  And what about bath time?  Well, bath time you took a bath once a week. You had to take the tub  behind the   in the wintertime, you carried the tub, number three tub,  behind the stove in the front room to keep warm, and you took a bath in  that once a week. I said,    I guess we all stunk in school, so we didn   t  know who,    because you only had a bath  once a week  and you only  changed your underclothes about twice a week. You didn   t change them,  so you can imagine. I never thought of that when I was little.  Did you get fresh water or did you have to share the tub water with  someone else?  The water that we   you mean in the bathtub?  Yes.  No everybody had   we dumped the water and we   d do the water on the  stove again     Between each one?   Yes . The drinking water, now this is something else, too. You had a  gallon bucket that you drew the water from the well, and the well was  about from here to that backyard of ours. That was the bathroom, but  you drank the water out of the well. You drew it in bucket, and you put  it in the kitchen, and you had a handle, a big handle, that would hold  onto the bucket and everybody drank out of that cup. You didn   t have  a   nobody had an extra cup. You just drank out of that one cup,  everybody did.  Stayed pretty healthy?  Yes, yeah. I always   I was   I never had any problems. None of us did.  How big of a town was that?  How big is Du Quoin? Du Quoin, it was a pretty good size place.  About six, sixty-five hundred I think now.  It was pretty good size.  I don   t remember it changing much even from when I was a kid. It   s  always been about that size.  10  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  But we were in the middle class, and that   s the way all the middle class  lived, just like we lived. They all had about the same houses and didn   t  have too many people that had much money in the town. Just the doctors  and the lawyers was about the only people that had any money. Rest of  us were all middle class, worked in the mines.  Did you have a garden?  Oh yeah, we had a garden. My dad always   you could have your  animals. We had pigs in the backyard. If you wanted your animals you  had to   and if you had a horse, you had a barn with a horse in it. We  used to, my sister and I, used to take the little pigs and put them in the  doll buggy and take them walking. (Laughter) So we used to play with  the little pigs like they was dolls.  Dress them up?  Yes. (Laughter) Yeah, we had a good time, my sister and I.  Did you have chickens?  Yeah, we had chickens too. We had pigs and chickens.  In town though?  In town. Yeah, oh yeah, everybody had them. You could have your  garden, you could have your animals, you could have your horses, you  could have everything in town. Everybody had it.  Did you have ice?  Oh the ice man would come in a buggy and come by in the street. If you  wanted ice, and he   d sell you ice out of his buggy. If you had ice cream  cones, there   d be an ice cream man. He   d come down the street and ring  a bell and you   d go out and buy an ice cream cone from him. Then your  milk, you had to put your bottle on the front porch if you wanted milk,  an empty bottle. Then they   d set the milk with the money on the porch.  We   d have the milkman bring it. That   s how you got your milk and your  ice and your ice cream. You   d hear them come. When my sister and I     we   d go and they   d give us a quarter, my mom would, on Saturday and  we   d go to the show and it   d cost a dime a piece. Then we   d take the  nickel and buy a sack of popcorn. So we had that once every Saturday.  Do you remember your first show?  I don   t remember because I went to the show on Saturdays from the time  11  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  Finchum  I can remember. But my first show, of course it was all no talking. You  had to just read it, you know, to know what was going on. And this is an  odd thing: the piano player would play the piano when there   d be a  storm coming up and of course, it was always wild west stories on  Saturday. That   s what they were and they were continued so you   d want  to go back the next Saturday. I   d go down to the front of the thing and  watch him play the piano, because I enjoyed the music. Years later, that  man that played that piano was my brother-in-law. (Laughter) Isn   t that  something? But I never will forget he used to play the piano, noisy, but  you had to read everything. No sound or anything. Yeah, it was  altogether different than it is now. (Laughs)  Well, did you have a favorite subject when you were in high school?  I liked arithmetic. I loved arithmetic. I hated spelling, still can   t spell.  (Laughter) Nancy still helps me spell.  Did they have home ec? Or home economics?  Yes, I didn   t take it because I didn   t like home ec. I took science. I like  science and I took science. Then when I got married, I needed to work  and I started in a factory, and I guess I was the worst person they ever  did try to teach how to sew, because I didn   t know how to sew. Oh, it  was a long time I learned, had to learn. Then I ended up in the dress  factory running five different companies. They built the building south  of Du Quoin after World War II and I went down there and opened the  doors. After the war, I unlocked the door and when it closed in 2002, I  closed the door.  You were there the entire time.   No. I was in Arkansas for four years then came back to Illinois to start  another factory.   Is the building still there?  Yes, but they don   t have anything anymore. All the garments are sent  overseas. I was telling them, the last garment that I worked with was  Bridal Originals. It was making brides    dresses and formals. They finally  sent them off all overseas and they   d send them back to us. If we   d press  those garments, we could take the label out and say    Made in United  States   . I know that, because I knew. (Laughter) People don   t know  those things.  No.  12  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  So, you learn a lot.  Well let   s back up a little bit, so when did you get married?  When did I get married? Right after I graduated.  So in the    30s.  Yes, in    32 and during the Depression too.  During the Depression.  When I got married, I had to scrub my clothes on a washboard, too. My  husband was a painter and I had to scrub all my clothes on the  washboard in 1932.  This is another story I don   t know that you   ve ever heard. You know  you didn   t have undertakers when I was a little girl, and the first person I  ever saw that was a dead person, was a World War I soldier. His parents  lived across the street from us and if anyone died you bought the casket  at the furniture store. I don   t know who put the people in the casket. I  guess you had to put your own people in, because you didn   t have  undertakers. Then they would take the person home in the casket and  they would keep them about two days. Someone had to sit up with them  at night. Someone would be there at night to sit up. You didn   t leave the  casket. But they put a wreath on the door and when you saw that, you  knew someone inside was dead. I   ve never been able to put a wreath on  my door, because it reminds me of somebody inside dead. But that   s the  way they did it.  We found that out because we used to put wreaths on the door, and she  kept saying,    I don   t want that on the door.    She told me why and I  thought,    Okay.    (Laughter)  I just don   t like a wreath on the door because that   s the way they did.  And then they   d put the casket on a trailer and a horse would draw it to  the graveyard. It was all dirt roads.  Speaking of dirt roads, tell them about your trip to the county fair.  My brother was playing in the band at the county fair, and that was  fourteen miles from where we lived. The women were going to have a  big dinner for the band that afternoon, and in a horse and buggy we went  to the fair, to Pinckneyville  Illinois  to the fair. Took us four hours to  get to Pinckneyville in the horse and buggy. My sister pressed my dad   s  pants and he had grease on it, and so we had a time. It was all dirt roads  13  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  to Paytonville. I   ve had a big life. (Laughs)  Well, how did you meet your husband?  I had a date with his nephew and he was with his nephew and I had to  get a girlfriend for him. When I saw him, I don   t know why, I just told  this girlfriend the next day,    You don   t like that guy. I do.    (Laughter)  He was bashful, he was so bashful. We had a reunion at the school, and I  made him go to his class reunion, and this woman said to me,    Well how  in the world did you get him to marry you?    She said,    I sure tried to get  him to date me but he didn   t.    She said,    Did you ask him?    I said,    I  probably did. I don   t remember.    (Laughter) I don   t remember whether  he asked me or I asked him.  What did you do to court? What kind of dates did you go on?  Well now when I   we had a car then, so we had a car to go on dates, but  like I said, I had to take my sister all the time. (Laughs) And the first car  that I can remember was a Ford Touring and it didn   t have glass  windows. It just had   it was empty. You   d have to turn the thing on,  and jump out of the car, and crank it in the front, and when it started  you   d hurry and get back in the car before it died. That   s the way your  car was in those days. That was the first car. If it rained you had leather  things you could snap on the car. I remember that.  I remember the first airplane I saw down on the ground. My brother took  me on a bicycle over on the other side of town to see the first airplane  down. A lot of things you can remember that they didn   t have   they   ve  got everything now. Kids don   t realize what they   ve missed, because  they just sit now at the computer or something. They don   t get out and  enjoy life like  we did . I think we had a lot of fun with everybody. And  I don   t think they do. Do you think they do? I don   t think they do.  (Laughter) You don   t have a child yet.  I   ve got four.  You   ve got four? Well, do yours get out and play? (Laughter)  Well when you went on dates did your sister have a date too? Did you  double-date?  No, she didn   t have a date, usually. One time she had a date. I was with  his brother, and when we got home Mama said   I don   t remember what  she asked me, and I said,    Oh yeah, he had his little brother with him.     Well, his little brother was as old as he was nearly, but Mama didn   t  know that. (Laughter)  14  Bishop  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  Finchum  Fred  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  What was the age difference between you and your sister?  There was two years.  Two years.  Yes, just two years. But we were always close, my younger sister. My  older sister didn   t associate with us that much. (Laughter) She was about  five years older than we were. So she thought she was always grown up,  you know.  Go ahead.  When Grandpa was a policeman, the tri-state tornado went through  southern Illinois. You got to go see some of that.  Oh yeah, I went to Murphysboro  Illinois . Until we had the tornado  down here in Oklahoma, that was one of the worst tornadoes in the  United States. It was in Murphysboro and I my dad was a policeman. I  got to   he got to go through and see things and we saw   I got to go to  that tornado and saw it. Tore up the houses and killed one of the school  kids, several of the school kids killed that year. Then the man that his  son was killed finally moved to Pinckneyville  Illinois  and run a  newspaper. We went to see this one here  Moore, Oklahoma  so I   ve  seen   went to Joplin  Missouri . We saw that, and I   ve been around. I  have been in all the states in the Union because my husband was a  fisherman and I got to go everywhere fishing. We went all over  everywhere. We went to Canada, Mexico, all places.  Camping or did you stay at hotels?  Camping, in a tent most of the time. Later on it was  a camper.   But you never went with him in the boat, did you?  No, I couldn   t. I always get sick in a boat. I don   t know. I just couldn   t;  he just went fishing. We went all over. One time we went to Canada, on  an island, and nobody was there but us and the people that we went with.  And they   d fly in to see if we needed groceries and things, so I   ve had  experiences. Then I got to go to Europe. When they (Fred and Nancy)  came back from Europe, he was doing mission work and coming back to  Illinois, went with her mother and dad. We got to go to Italy and  Germany and France and all those places. Saw Patton   s grave, seen  Kennedy   s grave. I   ve worked but I   ve had a good time too. I   ve  enjoyed life.  15  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Sixty years  of working in the same industry  is pretty impressive.  It wasn   t the same company. It was the same building. They had  different companies. Started out making dresses and then that sold. They  sold out. Then I made sportswear, and then later made formals and  wedding gowns.  I worked for five different companies.   You actually sat at the machine and sewed?  I did until they put me on the floor for an instructor and then I   yeah, I  sewed. I always had a lot of patience with girls, that was good for me  because I had patience with girls, new girls. I knew how hard it was for  them to learn, and it was easier to take them and try to teach them how  to learn. It was good for me to do that, because I knew that they were  struggling.  Go back, how did you learn how to sew?  How I   d learn to sew? At the factory, they taught me to sew about a  couple of days after I started.  Did your mother sew?  My mother sewed all the time. She made all of our clothes, but I never     I didn   t like sewing, didn   t like cooking. (Laughter) Turned out in both  of them, turned out in the factory, but I enjoyed sewing. I had a lady  that    I had cancer, colon cancer. She said,    You   ll have to have an  operation.    And she said,    Do you make      , we were making formals     Then you were how old?  I was what, about eighty-something?  Eighty-nine.  Eighty-nine when I had that. She said,    Do you make this dress,  garment, formal?    I said,    No, but if you get me back to work in a week,  I   ll get you that formal.    I went back to work in a week. I worked at  Lepanto, Arkansas. I started a factory down there for Bobbie Brooks and  worked there for four years. I had a lump in my breast and I went to the  doctor and he said he could take it out and I said,    When?    And he took  it out in my lunch hour, and I went back to work. He took it out in his  office. My pain, I think, is pretty high. I have a pretty good tolerance.  Definitely, high pain tolerance. (Laughs)  16  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  I   ve had a good   I   ve had a full life.  The fabric changed a lot during those sixty years, didn   t it? The fabric.  Well yeah, oh yeah. It was mostly cotton then, but now of course...the  formals were all different fabrics you know, silks and satins and things.  I   ve worked on all kinds of fabric.  Were most of your workers female?  Oh nearly everyone. Very few we had   I   d say, well your janitor and  your mechanic, and then we had about three cutters that cut the  garments, and that   s about all the men we had. The rest of them was all  women. When the factory closed, I would say the women were about  average fifty that was working there. We couldn   t get no young people  there because it never was air-conditioned. It was always just heat.  How much did they get paid?  You mean the people that sewed?  Yes.  I don   t remember, just five dollars an hour I believe it was or something  like that. Then of course it was raised, but they didn   t make a whole lot  then. They worked eight hours a day at that sewing machine. I  apologized to them. We have reunions every year. I still go back to  Illinois and they   re going to have one for me in October now again  because I   m getting so old. They always say,    Well we   re going to have  a reunion.       Well is Louise coming?    They don   t think I   m still alive.  (Laughter) Well I go back there every year, and we just have a great  time, and I apologize to them for making them sit at a sewing machine  and expecting them to sit there and not even get up. I apologize to them,  because I did expect them to do more than now.  We didn   t have any colored people. They just didn   t come. They didn   t  want to work. The main guy, main colored guy that runs, what do you  call it? NAACP  National Association for the Advancement of Colored  People  or whatever that is, he brought these two girls to the factory one  day and said,    You don   t have any colored people here. Why?    I said,     We don   t have any applications,    and he said,    Well, these girls want to  work.    I said,    Well, we   ve got a job. I can put them to work right now.     So I put them to work. Well one of them came in at noon. She says,    I   m  not going to work any longer. I can   t work.    And I said,    You don   t  even know if you like to work or not.    She says,    I forgot I was  17  Nancy  Starkweather  Fred  Nancy  Starkweather  pregnant.    (Laughs) Then the other one, she went to sleep at her   machine . Her sewing instructor came to me and said,    I   m afraid she   s  going to sew her finger.    So I went to her and I said,    Do you feel bad?     I didn   t want her working if she was going to sleep. She said,    Well, I  don   t feel very good.    I said,    I can give you another job pulling  sleeves.    The puffer had to have the sleeve in it right side out when she  puffed them and I said,    All you have to do is put your hand in the  sleeve and pull it out.    Takes her hand and she closed like this. (Gestures  slow) I said,    You don   t pull it like that. You put your hand in and pull it  back out.    She lasted until noon. (Laughs) I   ve had a lot of experiences.  Then when you went to Arkansas, you had some experiences there  with     Oh you mean about the girl telling me about the Yankee?  That   s one of them.  That   s one of them and in church, when you were in the Sunday school  class. How you     I went to Sunday school class, and this is the way they felt about the  colored people, it was terrible. I felt so sorry for the colored people  because the town I lived in, Du Quoin, we had colored, but they were on  the other side of the railroad track. Still, they were treated decent. This  little town was horrible, and I went to Sunday school, of course I was  pretty important because I started the factory.  This was in the 1950s  and  oh, it was a little bitty town and I was at Sunday school one Sunday  and this teacher said something about color. I don   t remember now. She  said they didn   t have a soul. I said,    What did you say?    I said,    They   ve  got the soul just the same as you have.    I got by with it because I was  important at that time. (Laughs) But that   s the way they felt about  people. They built a swimming pool across the street from the colored  section. Then the colored kids couldn   t go in that swimming pool and  swim at all. They just could watch the white people swim. They really  treated them terrible.  I was in a wreck and smashed my nose completely and we had to hire     my mother was living with me, and we had to hire a person to come help  her. I was working, I didn   t miss work. My mom said to this colored  lady, she said,    You want to sit down and eat lunch with me? Let   s sit  down and eat lunch.       I wouldn   t think of eating lunch with you.    She  said,    If they looked in that window, they   d chase you out of town.     That   s the way they felt about them. It was terrible, just awful the way  they treated them. And they couldn   t shop, they had to wait until all the  white people quit shopping and then they could go in the stores and  18  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  shop. You can   t blame them for feeling the way that they do sometimes.  What time period was this? What years was this going on?  This was in    59,    58,    59, something like that. I went down there, when I  went down to Arkansas, the secretary said to me (I   d been there about a  month) and she said,    I got a compliment for you.    And I said,    What   s  that?       Well you   re not a damn Yankee anymore, you   re just a Yankee.     (Laughter) So I   ve had some experiences. I   ve enjoyed life.  How long were you in Arkansas?  Four years.  Just four? And then went back to Illinois?  Yes, went back. They opened the factory. They had closed the factory at  that time. So they opened it and wanted us to come back, so I went back  to Illinois then. We were there four years in Arkansas.  While you were doing this was your husband still a painter? Or did he  switch jobs?  No, he had a job. He painted the whole time.  And how many children did you have?  I just had two boys.  Two boys.  But I was married fourteen years before I had them.  You were too busy.  (Laughter) That   s right.  But when my husband came back from the World War II, he was in the  service, I said,    If we   re going to have a family, we   d better start,     because we were both up in the thirties. I was thirty-four years old. Ten  months later I had one boy.  Fred was born.  Eighteen months later I had another one then. My youngest son passed  away last year, or this year it was, the day after Christmas. He was  19  Nancy  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  climbing a tree deer hunting. He   d built a deer stand and he and his  grandchild, his wife   s granddaughter went with him, she   s eleven years  old. He climbed up into the stand and when he got to the top he said to  this little girl, he said,    I      , and died. Just dropped dead then and this  little girl was there. She had to call her mother. They had to have the fire  department to get him out of there. It was terrible, it was awful.  He had Agent Orange, he was a Vietnam veteran.  It was something to go through, it was just a day after  Christmas . He   d  fixed   we   d had dinner at their house the day before. I think there was  about thirty people there for dinner on Christmas. He fixed the food, I  mean smoked the   what was it?  Turkey.  Smoked the turkey and all, and so it was a shock to all of us.  When your husband went to war, what did you do?  When he went to work?  War. When he went to the service.  I went down when he had his training. I just took off from the factory. I  was there about, I don   t know how long, several months. And I went  with two other girls and we stayed in a little apartment room with I think  it was two little beds or something, upstairs. I said,    I   m not going to  stay here. I   m going to try to find me a job.    So I found a job and I  worked while he was in the service.  Where was that?  That was in Texas and we went down and I got a job there and I stayed  at that place. This lady, I guess she was sick. She never came out of the  bedroom.  Well did he have to go overseas?  Yes, he was the first one wounded in his outfit when they had D-Day,  you know, went into France. He was shot through the ankle and then he  was sent back to the hospital in England. When he went back they had  had this big push back up in the North in his outfit, he was with a tank  outfit. And when he got back only two of the boys were still living.  They   d been killed while he was   so he was lucky he got out of that. He  got the Purple Heart, he had a Purple Heart.  20  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  Well while he was over there what were you doing?  Well, when he went overseas  and was  through training, then I went  back to Illinois and started working again. I just took off with the  factory. No, I worked then. Paid my house off while he was gone.  (Laughs)  You   re amazing.  Now the house was not that big. I think it was  14,000. In those days  you could build a house for a little bit. It was a small house, but I had it  paid for when he come back. I   ve had a pretty good experience in life.  Has church played into that any?  Oh, that   s all   I   ve lived in church. Oh yeah, in church, I was a   taught  Sunday school class. Started teaching when I was sixteen years old,  started teaching Sunday school. Until we moved to Arkansas I was the  superintendent of the young people   s department. So I   ve worked in the  church all my life, yeah. I   ve enjoyed church. But the factory   during  the war they sent me to Du Quoin to open up a factory over there. It was  in the church building that I was baptized in. They had condemned that  building when I was a little girl because the preacher wanted a new  church and that was the only way that they could get a new church built.  (Laughter) They condemned that building and we had a factory in that  building. Upstairs we even had sewing machines, and it wasn   t a bad     that building is still there and they still had meetings in it. We got a new  church. We had a big church there in Du Quoin built.  The basement leaked, didn   t it?  Oh that was at Pinckneyville (Illinois). I lived across the street from the  church and I taught in the department. I was always doing something in  the church. I went to church that morning. I always opened up my  department room and all, and I smelled smoke. The church was     downstairs was burning. I run over and called the fire department, and  we were standing in the parsonage, a friend of mine and I, and she was  crying. She said,    I don   t know why I   m crying, because I   m hoping it  burns down and we get a new church.    (Laughter)  Then one time, I had to start the boiler in the basement of the church  in  Du Quoin , I mean in the building. Oil would leak out of the boiler of  the morning. Of course I was always careful, but I dropped the match in  this oil and it caught on fire. The girls were upstairs. I run and I threw  water on it. They said,    You weren   t supposed to put      , but that water  21  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Fred  put that fire out. I don   t know how come that water put that fire out, but  it did. (Laughter)  Then one time, we had a boiler in the basement, a furnace. They had the  thing down in the hole, the stoker was down in the hole. When it would  rain, water would get in this stoker, get in the floor and you had to keep  the water dipped out of the floor. One night about nine o   clock the  janitor calls me. He says,    You   re going to have and come and dip this  water because I   m tired of dipping water.    I had to go and dip water all  night to keep the water out. So I   ve had some experience. I don   t think  anyone   s had much more. (Laughs) I worked sixty-five years at a  garment factory.  Well, when you were doing it in the church, what were you sewing?  What was being made, the garments? What were you making?  In the church?  Yes.  We were just making dresses at that time. One time a girl, she started to  turn her iron off and got hung and was going to   she would have died if  we hadn   t   and they run and pulled the plug. That was an awful thing,  too. Then I had in Arkansas, a girl died at her lunch thing. So, I   ve gone  through it.  Well did you make your own clothes, then?  Oh yeah.  Did you?  I sewed for everybody then. I made her wedding gown and her daughter-in-  law   s wedding gown. Oh yeah, I   ve sewed...  And you said you didn   t like cooking. Have you developed that talent  too?  Oh, I cook now. Oh yeah, I cook now. I have to have a recipe for  everything. (Laughter) My husband died and they said,    Come and live  with us.    So I said,    Well I   ll do that.    I didn   t want to live by myself. I  said,    I   ll come on two things: I do the cooking and I do the washing,  and if I can   t do that I   m not going to move in.    I still do the washing  and the cooking. She has to ask me if she can wash. (Laughter)  Or cook.  22  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Bishop  Or cook.  Or cook or anything   I got to make macaroni and cheese last night. (Laughter)  She   s good. She sure takes a lot from an old woman. (Laughter)  Not a lot. You   re a lot of fun.  We just have a ball. We really enjoy life.  Tell them what we do during the day.  We watch game shows so we can keep our minds going you know, the  questions, and you try to answer the questions before they   re on there.  So we watch that all the time to keep our minds going.  Yeah somebody asked the other day they said,    Do you watch game  shows? You like the Price is Right?    She says,    I don   t like anything  unless you   re going to learn something from it.    (Laughter) She said,    I  don   t learn anything.     Well you   ve got to keep your mind alert.  Well while we   re on that topic, describe a typical day for you now.  My what?  A typical day for you.  What time you get up     I get up at four-thirty and start. I put his water in the refrigerator so it   ll  freeze to put it in his lunch bucket. Then I get his lunch bucket ready and  then I get breakfast ready and then I go back to bed. Then at seven  o   clock, he gets up and we eat breakfast.  And then what? Take us through the rest of your day.  Well the rest of our day, we don   t have it too hard. She does all the  housework. (Laughter)  You sit and watch, huh?  23  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  Finchum  She does it all. I don   t do any housework. She does all that. But I do  make her tell me if she wants to wash in the washing machine, she has to  ask, get permission. (Laughter)  So you feed me breakfast before I go out the door, then what?  Then I go back to bed. (Laughs)  Then you get up at what time?  About ten-thirty. (Laughs) Then I go back to bed, then after he leaves,  then I go back to bed.  And I go out to get the mail and she likes to do all of the bookwork, she  does that.  It   s not nosy, I don   t care about that, but I want to keep my mind. So I  keep track of all their bills and tell them when they have to pay them and  how much and all. I   ve got a list of that, I   ve got a good list. (Laughter)  You guys are going to get us for elder abuse, taking advantage of her   (Laughter)  No, no. I want to do it or I wouldn   t do it. They wouldn   t make me do it.  I just want to be busy.  She   s her own person, and I love that about her.  I don   t want to just sit around. No use in living if you   re just going to  die. (Laughs)  So what time do you actually go to bed at night then?  I go to bed right after Wheel of Fortune. Seven o   clock, but then we get  up after they watch the show that they want to watch, maybe anything  they want to watch. Then they come and get me up and we play UNO,  and then we have a treat, and then I go back to bed about ten-thirty.  (Laughter)  She holds the all-time high record in the game. That was just two nights  ago.  Oh, we have a ball playing. Have you ever played UNO? Oh, we love  UNO.  Yes, but not every night though. (Laughter)  24  Starkweather  Nancy  Fred  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  We just have a ball with UNO. That   s one game that you don   t have to  be smart, because it   s just whatever you get.  Are you kidding? You have all kinds of plays. She   s got her plans.  But after UNO, the next question is,    What are we going to have for a  treat?    (Laughter)  Yeah, after we play UNO we have a treat, and then I go back to bed at  ten-thirty. I go to bed at seven and then I get up at around oh, nine, isn   t  it?  What do you typically have for a treat?  Usually ice cream or yogurt or something like that. We always have a  treat before I go back to bed.  People ask about her eating habits and how she stays healthy. You tell  them what you eat, your eating habits that you   ve had ever since you  were a little girl.  Oh, Apple? Oh yeah, I think it   s apples what   s helped me. I eat an apple  a day and my folks, when I was a little girl, they   d even buy bushels of  apples. I never missed a day of eating an apple, never.  But then what else do you eat besides apples that you really, really like.  That when we go to Sam   s you   ve got a big request.  Oh that   s candy. (Laughter)  Candy.  It   s candy.  She loves candy.  I love candy and apples. (Laughter)  What   s your apple of choice? What apple do you like the best?  Any of them.  Don   t have a favorite?  No I don   t have any; I just like an apple. I   ve always eaten an apple, and  25  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Nancy  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  I   ve got all but five of my teeth, my own teeth. So I think that   s why. I  never owned a toothbrush until I was married. Never had my teeth  cleaned but twice in my life. They   d said that you ought to have them  cleaned after you have a child, so after each one of the children I had my  teeth cleaned.  We really wanted her to get her teeth fixed and everything. She goes,     That   s a waste of money. Look how old I am.     I had a loose one and I called to see how much it   d cost. I think it was  thirty-five dollars to have it pulled. I thought,    Well I   m not going to pay  that. I   ll pull my own tooth.    (Laughter) So I pulled my own tooth.  Right out.  I pulled it myself.  So do you take after your mother or your father with all of this  determination?  Well I don   t know. My mother was sick most of her life, but she made  us work, which was good. I always thought I was abused, but I   m sure  glad she made me do it. We had to do nearly all the work. We had to  dust everything before we went to school and everything had to be so-so.  We had to wash the dishes when we got up from the table. The dishes  had to be washed in the wash pan and you had to wash them before you  went to school. So if you run to school that was your fault, not hers.  (Laughs) Of course, in those days everybody got up and ate at the same  time at the table. She fixed biscuits for my dad every morning, biscuits  and gravy. But all of us had to get up and eat at the same time. And you  had to be there for, we called it supper then, but now they call it dinner.  And noon was dinner. Now it   s lunch. (Laughter)  It frustrates her.  Well did you ever think you   d live to be 100?  Oh no. I didn   t dream I   d live to be 100. (Laughs) Now my mother was  ninety-two when she died. So, but my dad was seventy-six and he never  was sick a day in his life. I don   t ever remember my dad being sick. My  mom had all kinds of problems and she lived to be ninety-two.  How did you celebrate your 100th?  Oh the church had, my Sunday school class, had   I go to a class   when  we came here we met a lady and she took me to this class. Well they   re  26  Fred  Bishop  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Bishop  Starkweather  Nancy  Bishop  Finchum  Fred  Starkweather  Nancy  younger than I am, a good deal younger than I am. So I tell them all I  ought to go to an older class, but they said nope, just stay in that class.  So they had a birthday cake for me in my Sunday school class. They had  a birthday cake and they sang    Happy Birthday,    gave me a big bouquet  of roses. And the preacher told the church how old I was and I had a big  celebration. Get that   I   m going to get that thing and show you.  We have a ball. She   s as entertaining as she can get. You know, she   ll  just give us a hard time. If she   s not winning at UNO she gives us a real  hard time,    You guys are abusing me. You   re not letting me win      (Laughter) She knows we   re not going to let her win either.  She takes her weaknesses or things that need improvement and makes  them her strengths. That   s crazy. If I didn   t know to sew or do something  I would say,    No more. I won   t do that. My wife can try it.     Yeah, she is always up to any challenge. She   s really amazing.  They have a magazine that they have once a month, they put out. I   ll  give you that. You can throw them away or what you want. We   re in  there. (Laughter)  Say,    Who is that?     That   s nice.  Yeah, that was the church. We go to church that has what, 8,000  thousand members? They have 8,000 members. There   s always about at  least 2,400 or 2,500 in the service. My class, Sunday school class, has  seventy-five in it.  Pastor sees her; he always runs and gives her a hug.  She   s got the recipe right here.  For fried chicken? (Laughter)  We also, the year of her 100th birthday we also took her on her first  cruise.  Then my passport was,    Born in 1912.    When they put it in there the  computer wouldn   t take it, and they couldn   t get my date. They said,     Well you   re not alive. You   re a baby.    They couldn   t get my   they just  let me go on it. (Laughter)  It   s all set up for two numbers, twelve     27  Fred  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Bishop  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Two digits.     and so they were saying 2012.  I couldn   t get it     They were expecting a newborn baby when she showed up. (Laughter)  Then they, on the cruise, they have a certain table that they assign you to  for the evening. They made a birthday cake for me the last day. The  group sang    Happy Birthday    to me in this dining room and we had a  big time. We had a bottle of champagne in our room that evening. So we  really celebrated my birthday. (Laughs) Of course they said they   d never  had anybody that old on this cruise.  I imagine not.  We had one just this year again.  Taking up a lot of your time.  No, you   re great.  Now you have a fried chicken recipe on here, did you have Sunday  dinner?  Used to I always fixed fried chicken for noon. After church I   d go home  and fry chicken and have all my   for years I fried chicken after church.  While we were all     But I always go to church, never missed church on Sunday. I still go all  the time.  She fell on a Sunday two weeks ago. Then she went to church the next  Sunday and at that time, I guess, we weren   t sure if her rib was broken  or not. And so she said,    Oh, I fell. They think maybe I might have  broken my rib, but I   m not sure.    And they said,    And you are here?     (Laughter) But she   s inspiring.  I don   t like to miss church.  I   d say you don   t like to miss much.  No, I don   t.  28  Nancy  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Now that   s it.  It takes us about eight to nine hours to go to Illinois, you know where we  lived, and I go there. Every time they go to Illinois we go in the car. I  don   t stay home.  Do you have a motto or philosophy you live by?  Just keep a going. Make yourself go whether you want to or not because  a lot of times I haven   t felt like going, but I went because I think you just  have to make yourself. Don   t you think so?  Yes.  You got to be determined. I ain   t going to get down, might miss  something. (Laughter)  You don   t want to miss out.  No, I don   t want to miss out on anything. No, but you know, I love  people. I just really enjoy people and I think that   s a whole lot of it too. I  don   t care what color they are. That don   t make any difference to me  what color a person is, because they   re all just like me except their  skin   s a little bit different color. And I think that helps too, is I just like  people. I don   t care what color you are, if you   re not lazy. Now, I don   t  like lazy people. (Laughter)  Whatever color you are, if you   re lazy you   re in trouble. (Laughter)  Yeah, and I enjoy life.  What were holidays like when you were a little girl? Like Christmas,  Thanksgiving, July Fourth?  Christmas time, you only got one gift though. You didn   t get a whole  bunch of gifts like that. You either got a doll or a doll buggy or  something like that at Christmas time. But nowadays     What would your mother usually cook?  My mom cooked an awful lot all the time. I don   t remember now, I  guess we had turkey. I don   t remember. We always celebrated all the  holidays. My mom fried chicken every Sunday. She always had chicken  for everybody.  29  Nancy  Starkweather  Fred  Nancy  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Were they chickens that you had in your yard?  No we had to go out and get   we   d go out in the   then, in those days,  you had to go out on the farm and get your chicken and bring it in and  cut its head off. Then you scalded it and pulled the feathers. That   s how  you had fried chicken.  That   s how we did fried chicken when I was a kid.  I remember being at your house and I was totally, couldn   t believe it.     What? What   re you doing?     Cut up your own chicken, too?  Yeah.  That   s not done much anymore.  No, nope.  Would you do a pulley bone, the wishbone?  Yeah, well, I hardly ever do that. Now you can even buy them and you  don   t have to do all that work.  Doesn   t taste the same though, does it? Does it taste as good?  Yeah, it   s about as good. All the grandkids, they all want to know how  to fry the chicken. I fried chicken, showed them, and her son, their son,  he come and said,    Now, I   m going to fry the chicken and you stand and  watch me and tell me what to do.    So he fries chicken now too.  Well, do you remember voting for the first time?  No, I don   t remember voting for the first time. I remember voting in  Arkansas.  I knew this was coming. (Laughs)  That was something else, that Arkansas voting was something else in     59. You sat down at a long table and a man   s behind you seeing how  you   re voting. I voted for somebody, I didn   t know who to vote for  really, I was just voting to be voting because they told me to vote. I  voted for somebody and he said,    Oh, you don   t want to vote for that  person.    And I said,    Why, if I mark my ballot then it   ll be no good.        Oh no, just mark it out. That   s alright.    That   s the way they voted. I  30  Finchum  Starkweather  Fred  Starkweather  Nancy  told them that I   ll furnish the material, the factory will furnish the  material if you build little shelters so you can go in. That wasn   t   they  didn   t do that. So then, when we was leaving, just before we left they  were voting again and they said to me,    Did you go down and vote?    I  didn   t go till late and my husband said,    Be sure you go down and vote.     He hadn   t got there yet and they said,    Is your husband not coming to  vote?    I said,    Well yeah, he   d told me that he   d be here.       Well, he  might not come. Here   s his ballot and you vote for him.    He came in  about that time, but that   s the way they voted in Arkansas. (Laughter) I  was there, I know. I told them,    I would furnish the material if you   ll let  them go.     They didn   t.  When you sit at a table and they go look and see how you   re voting. It  was something. That was in    59. I don   t know how they do it now. Well,  when I was moving down there we had sleds for the kids and we   d make  snowman and all. We had enough snow in Arkansas   I mean in Illinois.  And they said,    Oh no, we don   t have any snow, so you don   t need to  bring your sled.    I don   t know whether I sold them or gave them away.  Anyway, I didn   t take the sleds. That winter we went to Arkansas, they  had the deep snow. We even made a snowman. They made a snowman  that first year we were in Arkansas. (Laughs) I said,    Do you have  cyclones?    You know, we had cyclones in Illinois, but    No, we don   t  have   I don   t recall any.    They had a cyclone about half a mile from us,  wasn   t it? Tore up a whole lot of the Mexican houses and all. They had a  cyclone. I don   t know whether I took it there or what, but anyway. We  had a cyclone one time we were at the factory where I worked at     She   s referring to tornadoes.  They told us a tornado was coming, you know, to watch. So we let all  the people go home, but I was fixing the time cards and the janitor and I  just went into the hall and walked out the door to see what was coming  at us. We look and we see this thing going down and coming back up  and going down. It was coming our way, and it was right in our  direction. We lost it. I said,    Where did it go?    He said,    I don   t know.     It was across the road tearing up all these trees, just twisting them all out  of the thing, and it went up over the factory and dropped back down  after the factory. But I was in it, watched it coming and didn   t know  what to do because there wasn   t anything you could do then, because it  was at you.  Now that one in Murphysboro, nobody knew that was coming, did they?  31  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Nancy  Starkweather  Finchum  Bishop  Starkweather  Bishop  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Not that I know of   that was before they had radios or television. I  remember my first television. Oh, it tore up Murphysboro. It was  horrible. I think it tore up practically all of Murphysboro.  Remember the tornado we had around here? That was interesting.  Oh yeah, we had a tornado here   Fred, I was in bed and they said,    A  tornado   s coming. You   ve got to get up and dressed, because we   re  going to outrun it.    So I had to get up and put my clothes on. We went     Fred went north because he knew which direction it was coming in.  I told her,    It   s right here Louise,       I   ve got to get my clothes on.       You  look fine. Let   s just get out of here.       I am putting my clothes on.     (Laughs) Anyway, we went north and we missed it. When we get back,  here on this road is 51 right out here that you came   it just tore one of  the filling stations, tore it up just a few miles from us here. We got back  on the highway. We didn   t know whether   there was a police at that  intersection, everything. Well, we didn   t know whether we had a house  to go to when we got over here. But it didn   t touch anything here, but  tore it up on that highway there.  A couple of blocks.  So, we just lucky. I   m taking up all your time.  No, you   re good.  Well when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  About me?  Yes.  Oh, I don   t care what you say. (Laughter) Say,    She   s crazy.    You can  just enjoy life, keep going. Yeah, just keep on going, enjoy people, like  people. I think that   s one of the main things in life is not thinking you   re  better than anybody else. Don   t you think that   s important?  I do.  Because I never felt like   I had authority but I never felt like I was  needed any more than the janitor or the mechanic or anybody else  because you have to have all them, same as you have to have somebody  to run it. I never felt like I was anymore a part than the people that work  for me. It   s just because people that want to work are good people. Lazy  32  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  Finchum  Starkweather  people   (Laughter)  I hope we   re not in that category. (Laughter) Well, anything else you  want to add before we shut it off.  I think I   ve added enough. (Laughs)  You   ve been great, thank you very much.  I think I   ve took up too much of your time.  No, you   ve been great. Thank you.  I enjoyed you.  -------  -------
