Speaker 2: I love the saying, my grandfather used to say this, "I'll help you if you let me."
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 36334
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side and your father's side separately.  Then we'll put 'em together.  We'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother is Naomi Lewis Brooks, N-A-O-M-I, maiden name L-E-W-I-S, last name, B-R-O-O-K-S.
Speaker 1: And, sir, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her place of birth is Alexandria, Virginia.  Her date of birth is 14 April, I wanna say 1934.
Speaker 1: Okay, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace that side of the family?  And I understand it goes back pretty far.
Speaker 2: It goes back quite a ways.  So there's two lines there.  So my paternal side, my grandfather's side.  My grandfather was James Lewis, and he was from the Haymarket area of Virginia.  He, his father worked at the seminary up on King Street and Quander--and Quaker Lane, the theological seminary up there.  I believe he was a gardener working up there.  My grandfather--I saw him, I remembered, the only time I can remember him actually is when I was at his funeral when I was a very small child.  The, my mother's maternal side, my grandmother's name was Eunice Quander Lewis.  And the Quander family is a, has a very well documented history here in the United States, going back from their arrival here as slaves, and then--as a matter of fact, there's a Quander buried at Mount Vernon [in Fairfax County, Virginia, near Alexandria, was the plantation home of the first President of the United States, George Washington].  And that family settled off of Route 1 in, very near Mount Vernon actually.  And there's actually a road down there called Quander Road, and so my grandmother was from that area.  So southern Alexandria area.  My father's side, my father's [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] father [Houston George Brooks] was--
Speaker 1: Oh, wait a minute.  We're not gonna ask about your father's side yet.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 1: But just something about, more about the Quanders and since that--I think they came over, if I'm not mistaken--
Speaker 2: From Ghana.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: They came from Ghana.  At one point, I know there was actually a display in the Smithsonian Institute featuring some of the artifacts and things from the family and the family tree because there'd been so much work done on it to actually trace back the roots of the family.  That family to this day still has a major reunion every year.  It rotates between Virginia and Pennsylvania where another big, large group of them, Quanders live.  And so that's, really well-established family.  Less, I know less about my grandfather's side, other than my great grandfather.  I know that when I was a little boy my grandparents lived on Quaker Lane, just South of the intersection of Seminary and Quaker, about a quarter of a mile South of it.  And there was a parcel of land there where my grandfather had his house, which was right on Quaker Lane, and then deeper on that piece of land, which is now where--there's a Lexus dealership in there, is where there was a house that was my grandfather's house.  I could remember going out into that outhouse still.  I still remember that from when I was a little boy.  And so that's where those two families lived.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think the, there's a piece on public radio for those watching this that wanna know about the Quanders, there's a, they have this huge family reunion.  I think they go back to 1619--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And actually, so, the, because these--there's such a large Alexandria-based family, I actually have Quanders on both my father's side and my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36335
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did your grandparents [James Lewis, Jr. and Eunice Quander Lewis] do for a living?
Speaker 2: So my--
Speaker 1: On your mother's [Naomi Lewis Brooks] side.
Speaker 2: On my mother's side.  So my grandfather was a chauffeur almost, most of his life.  And he was the chauffeur for the president of the United Mine Workers for many years, decades.  In fact, he did that, I think, even when he got to the age where he couldn't really even drive, I'd say he was over eighty years old, they still kept him on the payroll because his life was work.  And he, and he became the special assistant to the president of the United Mine Workers.
Speaker 1: So this is the famous John L. Lewis.
Speaker 2: That is, he--that is correct.  He, his most memorable and long time was with John L. Lewis.  There's a, the Lee Fennell House which is right down off of Washington Street in Alexandria [Virginia] is where he used to work out of.  That's where the, John L. Lewis lived.  The, and every year, my mother reminds me about how they would pack up in the car, and they would drive to Florida because John L. Lewis would spend the summer in Florida, and that was his driver.  And he would--John L. Lewis hated to fly.  And so he would drive John L. Lewis to Florida.  Then have, get his family, bring them down there.  And then they'd stay in Florida, you know, in the summers, you know, because John L. Lewis was the kind of man--and candidly, that man's work ethic has affected me in terms of how I look at work, all of my family, who has a dedicated, hard working, positive, upbeat man.  The other thing he did was, he was a deacon in his church.  And his church was Oakland Street--or Oakland Baptist Church which is right at the intersection of Seminary and Quaker Lane, right next to T. C. Williams High School.  That's the church my mother grew up in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother basically was a domestic, stayed at home, took care of the family at home, took in laundry and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's quite a story.  And I think your brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker] was telling us that there's no relationship biologically that he knew of between John L. Lewis and James Lewis, your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Right.  The dedication, though, that the two of them had and love that they had for one another is very apparent.  My grandfather, I can still remember him talking about--when I was a little boy, just how much he respected John L. Lewis.  And John L. Lewis would do things for him, and sometimes they'd be small, but, you know, to him they were significant.
Speaker 1: Right, because John L. Lewis, basically, is the grandfather of the unions--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --in this country for the most part.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, so--
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, when my grandfather died, the thing I will, the only things I will always remember is, this is a man came from incredibly humble beginnings, that was a chauffeur all his life, and when he was being eulogized, there were like two or three former presidents of the United Mine Workers sitting in that church.  And it just goes to how much that man touched people's lives.  So it doesn't, you know, the lesson for me was, it doesn't matter where you're at, you can affect people's lives by your attitude and by your dedication to what you do.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 36336
Speaker 1: Now, what did your mother [Naomi Lewis Brooks] say about growing up?  Did she, I mean what did you learn from her about what it was like to grow up during her time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Alexandria?
Speaker 2: So, my mother grew up in, you know, segregated Alexandria [Virginia], went to Parker Gray High School, which doesn't exist anymore.  Parker Gray was one of the high schools that ended up being a feeder school that ended up becoming what is now T. C. Williams [High School].  The famous movie, 'Remember the Titans' was about several high school, black high schools coming together to go to the, intermingle with the white high school, T. C. Williams.  And Parker Gray, and I think it was Hammond High School combined, and then that high school then went to T. C. Williams.  So that's where she went to school.  By the way, that group of people are still to this day, they stay in touch with each other, these original Alexandrians.  She, my parents, my mother talked about the fact that--matter of fact, my daughter, one of my daughters actually got a partial college scholarship from the Parker Gray alumni.  I mean that, the legacy just continues.  They continue, that group--it's not a big group of people.  But they wanna continue to give back to the next generation.  So they created scholarships.  And, you know, people have to apply for 'em, and one of my daughters, my youngest daughter actually received one of those, which is very touching to me and my grandparents--or my parents to see that.
Speaker 1: That's a great story.
Speaker 2: The problem they obviously had was, they had to travel long distances to do anything.  My mother was a very accomplished athlete.  She was a great basketball player.  But for her to play basketball, they only played against other black schools.  They had to travel all the way down to, you know--when you think about it now, you may travel around just a few miles to another school within your district.  And back then, they might have to travel all the way out to Warrenton [Virginia].  They might have to travel all the way out to, you know, travel to Manassas [Virginia] or Fredericksburg [Virginia], just in order to compete with schools.  They always had, we've all heard about "separate but equal."  Of course, it was nothing equal about it.  And I remember her telling me, even recently that she never had a textbook that had a cover on it the entire time she was in high school because everything she got was a hand down, hand-me-down that came from the schools of the white majority kids after they were done with it.  She never had a textbook that didn't have writing in it, you know, from where kids were taking notes and things of that nature.  So that's the experience that she had.  She, but, you know, her--she grew up in the church.  As I told you, my grandfather [James Lewis, Jr.] was a deacon, so very rooted in church.  She played the piano in the church.  So my grandfather had her and her siblings all very involved in the activities that occurred in the church.  They were really strict on her about dating when she was growing up.  You know, I can recall her telling me about how they were just ruthless because, unfortunately, well, one of the plights that we are still seeing, especially in some of our underserved communities, around here even, is, you know, youth getting pregnant, having babies, not having a--and then their future sort of collapses. And my grandparents, neither one of them went to college.  Matter of fact, I don't think either one of them graduated from high school.  And, but they were determined to make sure that they created an opportunity for their kids.  So they were very strict and strong on the power of education.  And I think they saw the only way you're gonna, you know, break the cycle, is through education.  And so my mother is the oldest of her siblings, and so she went off to Virginia State College, and, you know, graduated in four years, met my father [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] while she was down there.  And the rest is history, as they say.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did your mother major in at Virginia State?
Speaker 2: She's an education major.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And throughout her life, she was, she has taught school, generally, elementary school throughout her life.
Story_ID: 36337
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna go to your father's side, and then we'll put 'em together.  Can you give us your father's full name and it's the same as yours, right?
Speaker 2: Leo Austin Brooks [also a HistoryMaker].
Speaker 1: Senior.
Speaker 2: Senior.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is 9 August, 1932.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what can you tell us--he was born in--
Speaker 2: He was born in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  But he was raised in--
Speaker 2: He was raised basically in what we now know as Del Ray [Virginia], right in, you know, northern side of, the southern side of--well, by Four Mile Run, just South of Four Mill Run, off of Gleebrook (road? ph.).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What can you tell us about--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous) Avenue, specifically.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I'm sorry.  I stepped on it while you were talking about it--
Speaker 2: No, that's all right.
Speaker 1: --what avenue did you say it was?
Speaker 2: They lived, the vast majority of their life growing up on a street called Elbert Avenue--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is in, like I said, the Delray area of Alexandria.  And it is sort of near where the railroad yard, what used to be the railroad yard, is in Alexandria.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what can you tell us about your father's side?  How far back can you trace his side of the family?
Speaker 2: You know, actually, it's harder to trace him, at least my knowledge of him.  So my, I knew my grandfather.  I can't on my grandmother's side.  On my grandfather's side, my grandfather, Houston George Brooks, grew up as, doing work, like he was a painter.  He did carpentry work.  He, his father, Pap, you know, I should know Pap's first name, but I've always known him as Pap, my great grandfather, was actually a vaudevillian.  And in addition to that, because obviously, that was not something could sustain yourself on for life.  He again did things like painting and carpentry and things of that nature, handyman kinds of work.
Story_ID: 36338
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of act did he [Brooks' paternal great-grandfather, "Pap," who was a vaudevillian] have?
Speaker 2: You know, I believe it was, he was a musician, played the trombone if I'm not mistaken, which, and that permeated throughout my family.  My father [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] was, for example, and I (unclear) know where I get that, but my father was a music major in college, you know.  And that's an extension of that passing down, I'm sure, from my, his grandfather, my great grandfather.
Speaker 1: Right, and a trombone player too.
Speaker 2: And a trombone player, exactly, as was my brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker] a trombone player.  I was a trumpet player.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  So your mother [Naomi Lewis Brooks] plays the piano--
Speaker 2: Mother plays the piano, right.  So, you know, matter of fact, we talked about the Quander reunion earlier.  I can recall vividly, as a little boy, having a little trio, my dad and my brother on trombone, me on a trumpet playing an old hymn, "Rise Up Oh Men of God."  I can still hear it because my dad like, was--drilled us for weeks practicing this song.  You know, I was probably fifth grade, in preparation to play at the Quander Reunion.  I can still remember it.
Speaker 1: "Rise Up Oh Men of God"--
Speaker 2: "Rise Up Oh Men of God," that was the song we played.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 2: At the Quander Reunion.
Story_ID: 36339
Speaker 1: Okay, so Pap [Brooks' paternal great-grandfather] was a vaudevillian, and--
Speaker 2: Pap was a vaudevillian.
Speaker 1: And, well, what else about Pap?
Speaker 2: You know, I know he and my grandfather [Houston George Brooks], as I know it, had an on and off relationship, you know.  It wasn't what I would call the traditional full, loving relationship.  I think it was strained at times.  I know that my grandfather was partly raised by somebody that wasn't his mother or father, a Ms. White.  And she's buried in the southern part of Alexandria [Virginia].  I don't know much about Ms. White, but I know, I know that was somebody who was an influence in his life, that helped raise him.  One of these kind of things where somebody kind of takes in the kid that's, you know, doesn't have somebody to raise 'em.  That's how my grandfather was raised as a young boy.  He grew doing this handy work kind of thing, the carpentry and the painting, and then he end up forming his own business and doing that.  And that's what his, he did with his children as well.  And then he, again, God has played a significant role in our whole family's life, both sides.  He then became a minister and was, and then that became his full-time vocation.  And he used the painting business or whatever just to supplement his income, and wallpapering.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Speaker 2: He used to have a car.  I still can remember the old car they had was just covered in splatters of paint, with a ladder.  They used to have a ladder that they'd tie up on the roof of the car.  I can't even describe what it was, but it was one of these old like, you know, 1950s vintage cars with a big metal or wooden ladder tied to the roof, tied on front and back, and, you know, just splatters of paint from where they had spilled paint or had the car parked too close to the house they were painting or where the paint can emptied or something or fell over while they were driving or whatever.  But I can still remember that old car.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: They were one of the first people also to have indoor plumbing in their little neighborhood--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of people there.
Story_ID: 36340
Speaker 1: Now, what did your father [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] say about growing up in Del Ray [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: So, I think he had a very fun childhood.  He is one of five siblings.  He had two older brothers, an older sister and then a younger brother.  They all played together.  They had--to this day he has friends who I know who live in his, lived in his neighborhood, grew up on his street that he still interacts with.  You know, he's over eighty years old.  And so I, much more seemed like fun kind of relationship.  When he was a teenager, he used to tell me he used to go across the bridge over here from Roslyn [Virginia] and, you know, go play like in the clubs as a musician, in high school, you know.  So he was not into athletics.  He was into music.  He was musician.  My mom [Naomi Lewis Brooks] was more the athlete.  He was more the musician growing up, you know, followed my grandfather around because as he was becoming a journeyman pastor as a young, young pastor, you know, he'd move from church to church as that, you know, churches might have a vacancy while they're trying to fill a permanent role.  And maybe he would be there preaching.  So my parents grew, well, my dad grew up being packed in the car with his siblings and driving out to some church.  Some of 'em are, you know, as far down as Frederick [Virginia] and out in Warrenton [Virginia], and the one out in Leesburg [Virginia], are churches where he was, where he pastored.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Same kind of experience in terms of racial prejudice growing up, of not having the same things that others had in terms of, you know, books and things of that nature, very focused.  And that's a common theme between both my mother and father's parents was they both saw, again, two people, my grandmother and my grandfather on my father's side, neither of them graduated from high school either.  But they knew the importance of education, and they knew the importance of if we're gonna ever break the cycle and give--and have an opportunity, we gotta make sure our children go out and do that.  And, you know, and if you know the history of my, the siblings of my--both, well, each of my parents and their siblings, I mean they're incredibly accomplished in terms of, you know, their academic accomplishments.
Speaker 1: Right, there're several Ph.D.s and--
Speaker 2: Ph--yeah, exactly--
Speaker 1: --lawyers and--
Speaker 2: --so, you know, my father's older brother is a Ph.D. in chemistry.  His next older brother was a--and taught at Rutgers [University].  The next one was a Ph.D. in theology or I think psychology, and was the dean of the School of Psychology at Andover Newton Seminary in Boston [Massachusetts].  His sister, Ph.D. in education, was a superintendent of Fairfax County Schools, one of the biggest school systems in the country.  He's got an MBA in business from G.W. [George Washington University], in addition to going to Virginia State.  And his little brother graduated from Norwich University, you know, the oldest military college or, you know, civilian military college, ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] program, in the nation in Vermont.  So, you know, very--and a member of the State House of Representatives to this day in Vermont.
Speaker 1: That's Francis.
Speaker 2: That's Francis, Francis.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: So, so very accomplished.  And on my mother's side, my mother [Naomi Lewis Brooks] has a master's degree in education.  Her sister, her next oldest sister has a Ph.D. in education, taught at George Mason [University].  Her brother has a master's degree in, I believe it's education, was a pro basketball coach for the Mystics and to this day still, is assistant coach for the LA Sparks, women's pro basketball.  My mother's youngest sister had a, has an MBA [master's in business administration] in counseling--or not MBA, but has a master's in counseling and was a counselor of prisons in, mostly up in Pennsylvania.  And they have one other sister who did have some, had some mental challenges.  She was bipolar, that didn't go to school.  But all the rest of 'em, incredibly accomplished.
Speaker 1: Yes, it's an incredible record there, you know.
Story_ID: 36341
Speaker 1: So your father [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] majored in music at Virginia State [College]?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: And there he met your mother [Naomi Lewis Brooks]?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a--
Speaker 2: They knew each other in high school, but they didn't date.
Speaker 1: Right, right, he was telling me that.  That's at Parker Gray [High School; Virginia], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at Parker Gray, right.
Speaker 1: And, well, what is the story they tell of how they got together at Virginia State?
Speaker 2: You know, I should know that.  I should know that.  That's my parents.  I don't even know how they, when and how they met.  I know that they dated for two years.  I know that after my dad was, my dad was the Class of 1954.  My mom was the Class of 1955.  So my dad was a, commissioned as a quartermaster officer, logistician.  The headquarters for the Quartermaster School was located right next to Virginia State.  And so they were focused on making sure that my mother got her degree.  And so after they did not get married, although they were engaged while they were in school, they waited--my dad was basically assigned, you know, five miles away from where she was in school.  And they, you know, as soon as they graduated, they got married.
Story_ID: 36342
Speaker 1: --Just talking about your mother's [Naomi Lewis Brooks] brother--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jimmy, yeah.
Speaker 1: --being a basketball player.
Speaker 2: Oh, he was, he was really good.  I mean, you know, when he went off to West Virginia, first of all, it was like one of the blacks, first blacks to go off to the University of West Virginia, okay, played for Bucky Waters [basketball coach] there.  And then he, his love of basketball, you know, he stayed in basketball and became a--went into coaching, went with that coach.  When that coach ended up going to Duke [University], so he went to Duke and was a coach for him down there at Duke, and then he just kept--went to several different colleges where he coached, ended up becoming a pro coach.
Speaker 1: So this is Jimmy Lewis?
Speaker 2: So that's Jimmy Lewis.  And then so, I'll tell you a real interesting thing, make you proud.  So, about a month ago, the City of Alexandria [Virginia] unveiled a wall that's the, Alexandria African American Hall of Fame.  And they inducted in this first group of people in the Hall of Fame, about, I'd say maybe thirty people.  And these are Alexandrians that have made a significant difference in the world that are African American.  And out of those thirty people up there, you know, and this spanning time, three of them were my relatives.  My father [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker], my father's older sister, who's the Fairfax County School superintendent, and my brother, Jimmy, for athletics.  So, and in fact, they had one, they had one of the honorees speak for all of them at, you know, to represent them.  And the one that they had, that they chose to do that was my Aunt Nellie Quander.  And so she just, standing ovation for about four minutes, eighty-three [years old], as spry as she can be.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your Uncle Jimmy Lewis was, now, this is--I was just pointing out, I guess, on the side that Alexandria is also the home of Earl Lloyd [also a HistoryMaker] who was the first black--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --basketball player to actually play in an NBA [National Basketball Association] game.
Speaker 2: Right, and he was inducted too.
Speaker 1: Right, (laughter) okay.
Speaker 2: You know, his family, yeah, he was represented too, right.
Speaker 1: Right, right, and we've interviewed him.
Story_ID: 36343
Speaker 1: Your folks [Naomi Lewis Brooks and Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] get married, and your father, you know, starts a career in the military.  You know, he thought he was gonna be a musician--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, he starts a career in the military, which leads to him becoming a brigadier general and then--did he retire as a brigadier or--
Speaker 2: Okay, so the way that works is, you have to maintain, once you're promoted as a two-star general or as a general officer, you have to maintain three years in grade serving in that grade in order to keep that record, that title in retirement.  So my dad was selected for major general.  He did serve honorably as a major general for two years, but then he got this opportunity to serve as the managing director, city manager, of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And his parents [Evelyn Brooks and Houston George Brooks] were getting, you know, elderly.  He didn't, they were talking about him going to Europe as an assignment.  He had this great opportunity to work for the city.  He enjoyed living in Philadelphia where he was assigned up there in his military capacity.  And so just the cart--you know, the stars aligned, and he got--and he retired.  So because he retired at two, you know, two years in grade, his official rank in, you know, in retirement is brigadier general, retired.  But he was a two-star general.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 36344
Speaker 1: Now, your father [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] was on assignment in Anchorage, Alaska when you were born, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I, well, not too much about Alaska.  You know, my--both my parents [father and Naomi Lewis Brooks] were--my dad was assigned to the 23rd Infantry Battle Group.  Back then if you were assigned to what I will call a service, a combat service support kind of organization like quartermaster or logistician, very often, they would take those new officers, and they would actually give them duties in, say, a combat unit, infantry unit or Army unit.  And you do that for, say, your first couple of years, and then you have some kind of understanding of the kinds of people you're gonna support when you get older.  Well, my dad did that.  So he was an infantry platoon leader and company executive officer in the 23rd Infantry Battle Group in Alaska.  And then, so where I was born actually at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage.  I don't recall it, although I've seen lots of pictures (laughter), you know, about standing in front of an igloo or having a moose come and eat out of the trash can in the backyard, which is, when you think about it, for my, both of my parents who, I mean, you know, they never traveled far in their life at that point.  Little, a couple of kids from Alexandria, Virginia going all the way up to Alaska, and serving up there was quite a trek, quite an adventure for 'em.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he got there before Alaska became a state.
Speaker 2: I was born in Alaska before it was state.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a U.S. territory when I was born.  I think my--it was a state when my brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker] was born.
Story_ID: 36345
Speaker 1: Tell us about, you have a younger brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker] and a sister, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're the oldest of the--
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest of the three.  I was born, as we know, 15 August, 1957.  My brother is fifteen months younger than me.  He was born in October, October 24, 1958.  And then we have a sister that is six younger--six years younger than me, Marquita Karen Brooks.
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell Marquita?
Speaker 2: M-A-R-Q-U-I-T-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Middle name, Karen, K-A-R-E-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she's an attorney, right?
Speaker 2: She's an attorney for a firm called O'Melveny & Myers, big law firm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your brother just made four-star General?
Speaker 2: My brother made four-star.  You know, I graduated from West Point [United States Military Academy] in 1979, you'll--I know we'll talk about that later.  He graduated a year behind me in 1980.  And now he, on two--on 2 July, you know, he was promoted to general, four star.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36346
Speaker 1: All right, now, you grew up in a variety of places--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and I know your brother's [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker] first memory was of Xenia, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that your first--
Speaker 2: It is, it is--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Xenia's my first recollection.  So my father [Leo Brooks, Sr; also a HistoryMaker] was assigned after Alaska to Xenia, Ohio where he was an ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] instructor at Central State University.  And I can recall living there pretty vividly, actually.
Speaker 1: So this is like 19--you're about how old at this point?
Speaker 2: Probably about three.
Speaker 1: So this about 1960 then?
Speaker 2: About that, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Xenia, I was just pointing out--I don't know if you'd have been aware of it at the time.  You probably weren't, but, you know, Xenia's got a lot of history in terms of black officers.
Speaker 2: No, I don't know that.  I did not know that.
Speaker 1: You didn't, okay.  Yeah, Martin Delaney is buried there like four miles from Wilberforce [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: He was the highest ranking officer in the [American] Civil War.  Colonel Charles Young, you know, of which--
Speaker 2: A West Point [United States Military Academy] graduate.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, he's, his house is right there on 42 [Route 42], you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: And, of course, he was a mentor to Benjamin O. Davis who was also, you know, was in charge ROTC at Central State [University] at one time too.  So, this is--and then your father's there, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And you future generals are there (laughter).
Speaker 2: We were there, as (unclear) kids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So it's a lot of history.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It may be even more, but that's pretty good, you know, I would say so.  That's a historic place in a lot of ways.  So, what are your memories of Xenia?  Do you--
Speaker 2: Well, I remember several things.  One, one of my favorite pictures--my parents [father, and mother, Naomi Lewis Brooks] may have it, is a picture of my brother and I sitting up on a wall.  And it's either--my dad's an Alpha [Phi Alpha; fraternity], and it was like an Alpha symbol [cough], excuse me, an Alpha symbol on the wall.  And we were like sitting up next to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I can recall playing in the woods.  Where we lived, there were woods right behind our house.  My brother and I, you know, I can tell you one of the things that's very interesting.  As we grew up, we spent a lot of time playing outside and playing in the woods.  We were not, we didn't grow up sitting in front of television.  We grew up doing, in a very active way.  So I played in the woods.  I can recall the time my brother went next door.  My neighbor had his lawnmower sitting there with a gas can on top of it.  And my brother, Vincent, drank gasoline out of gas can.  And then rushing him to the hospital to pump his stomach, I can remember--I vividly remember that.  I remember one time there was a, we had a storm door, and the storm door had, the bottom half of it, a quarter of it was metal.  And the upper parts were glass.  And I can recall running like a lot of little kids would do, to go outside, and normally, I would just hit the latch, put my shoulder against it, push, go out the door, and was going too fast.  I went to the latch.  I missed.  I hit the shoulder to the glass and I was a little kid and then I went right through the glass, went completely through the glass, landed outside on the back stoop, concrete stoop, barely got a scratch, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I think about that 'cause I had a couple other really close scrapes in life where, you know, it's like God had something for me to do.
Story_ID: 36347
Speaker 1: Did you live in the village of Wilberforce [Ohio] there near the school or did you live in Xenia [Ohio], itself?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  We lived in a little brown house on the, that was on a dead-end street.  That's what I remember.  I don't, I'm not sure that was.
Speaker 1: You don't know if that was on the campus of [Central State University]--
Speaker 2: It was not on the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It was not on the campus.
Speaker 1: So it might have been in Xenia.
Speaker 2: And I remember also, you know--that's my first recollection of doing things like preschool, you know, daycare kinds of things because my dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] was teaching, and my mom [Naomi Lewis Brooks] was doing something.  I think she was either going to school or teaching or--she wouldn't have been teaching.  I'm not sure what she was doing during that time period to be honest with you.  But I can remember being there in the afternoons a lot or in the mornings, and then being picked up in the afternoon.  It's funny the things you remember.  I remember crackers, always looking forward to getting saltine crackers and an orange drink in the afternoon at this daycare where I was staying.
Speaker 1: Okay, nutritious food (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, there you go.
Speaker 1: All right, so how long were you there in Xenia?
Speaker 2: I believe they were there for two years.
Story_ID: 36348
Speaker 1: Then I recall, I recall going from there [Xenia, Ohio] to Arlington [Virginia].  My dad went to Vietnam [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker], and I have very--there are certain memories that I have about that, that are really strong.  You know, my dad went to Vietnam before there was any major troop buildup.  He was one of the initial advisors--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Vietnam.  So I was in first grade when he was in Vietnam at that time.  And so, and there were several monumental things that happened.  We lived in Arlington.  We lived up on top of a hill.  And from the things that stick out in my mind were my dad was there when President [John F.] Kennedy was assassinated.  And I can recall vividly watching the ceremony on TV, the funeral, seeing the missing man formation fly over Arlington National Cemetery and hear the jets going over my house at the same time because we lived that close to it, almost simultaneous and running outside, and looking up and seeing the jets fly over.  I remember, it was during that time also, I'm not sure which flight--but that was a big initial time for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  And I can remember watching several space flights go up, you know, during that particular time.  I don't know if it's, when the first--I don't know how many years straight, but I can recall vividly watching that and being just mesmerized by that.  And to now think I'm, you know, a senior leader in a company that actually is responsible for manned space flight, pretty awesome.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the first, yeah, do you remember the seven astronauts, initial astronauts in those days.
Speaker 1: Gus Grissom and, you know, yeah, exactly.
Speaker 2: Alan Shepard.
Speaker 1: Alan Shepard.  Matter of fact, look up on my wall up there, you see a picture with me, John Glenn and Alan Shepard right there--or not Alan Shepard.  That's Scott Carpenter.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Me, Scott Carpenter and John Glenn right there, where I actually got to host them at an event that Boeing was sponsoring.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you spent a, from what I understand, you spent a nice portion of your childhood at Arlington, around your--
Speaker 1: Arlington, Alexandria area.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, it's funny.  So one of the things I'll never forget is, we were--my sister [Marquita Karen Brooks] was born when we were living there, in Arlington.  So one of the things I remember, and my dad was in Vietnam, my mother [Naomi Lewis Brooks] was having a hard time with us, my brother [Vincent Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] and I 'cause we were acting up for her.  My grandfather, my paternal grandfather, Houston George Brooks, came one day and picked us up.  And this is a strong Christian man, a minister.  And he put me and my brother in the front seat of the car, took us for a drive.  And my grandfather said to us (laughter), he goes, while we're driving along, he goes, "Boys, you've been giving your mother a hard time.  And I'm not gonna put up with it.  If I hear you ever--if I hear about you ever doing it again, I'm a shake the crap out of you."  And he didn't say "crap." (laughter)  And so I mean, I mean I, just to have my grandfather say that to me was definitely an eye-opening experience.
Story_ID: 36349
Speaker 1: But we lived there [Arlington, Virginia], then my dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] came back from Vietnam, and then we moved to--that's where I went, again, to first grade.  Then we moved to Baltimore, Maryland.  My dad was stationed at what was then, Fort Holabird, which doesn't exist anymore.  And he was doing things to support the Vietnam War, again, in the very early stages, but before there were a lot of ground troops over there, based on his duties, having been over there as a advisor earlier.  And I recall that.  We lived in Lincoln Park, and I have definitely, that's where I really started to have, you know, have some really good friendships with people in the neighborhood.  That's where I started, you know, I can--played a lot more outside in the woods, again, we lived near a park, spent a lot of time out in the woods as a youth, while we lived there, in third grade.  We were only there for a year, and then we picked up from there, and we moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  My dad was in the Command and General Staff College [CGSC].  That was a very interesting experience for me because when we lived, when we lived in Xenia, Ohio, lived in generally an all-black neighborhood, as I recall.  When we lived in Arlington [Virginia], we lived in an all-black neighborhood 'cause you had to.  And when we lived in Baltimore, we lived in primarily a black neighborhood.  There was a few, but it was primarily a black neighborhood.  But when we moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas--now, think about this.  This is the first time--my parents [father and mother, Naomi Lewis Brooks] really kind of made an effort.  They didn't want us to grow up just on military bases.  We, they always chose to live in the community instead of trying to live on post all the time.  And so when we moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, you know, the military is the most integrated place there is.  And so now, I'm living in a neighborhood where I, it's the first time in my life where I was really a minority, you know, and--because there were very few, at that time--well, it's not all that much better now--but, you know, where there are a lot of African Americans that were attending the Command and General Staff College, which was generally for majors in the United States Army.  So my dad was selected as a resident student.  He was obviously doing really well, and so I grew up with people there.  And what I learned was, I really learned then--I did not, never looked at color.  I never, I grew up not looking at color unless somebody made me.  So I didn't look at things, like I had barriers in front of me.  I assumed I didn't have barriers, unless somebody made me, which, you know, I had repeated cases of that in my life, you know.  Or my parents would make sure I didn't forget that there--they existed.  But, in general, I operated like I didn't have barriers, in terms of who I played with, what I did, the kind of sports I chose to participate in, the classes I took.  I operated like, you know, it's like the old, 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' movie, one of the famous lines in there that I--with Spencer Tracy and Sidney Poitier, you know, Sidney Poitier is talking to his father.  And the father's telling him, you know, you can't date this white woman.  And they were having an argument about it, and he, Sidney Poitier saying, why not?   And in essence, what Sidney Poitier says, "you see me as a black man.  I just see me as a man," you know, in terms of, I don't--I'm not allowing barriers to be imposed on me because of the color of my skin, is the essence of what he's trying to say in that.  That's what, I operated.
Speaker 2: Okay, and that movie actually came out when you were ten [years old; 1967].
Speaker 1: Yeah, was that--I don't know what year it was, but I know it's old with Spencer Tracy.
Speaker 2: '67 [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You were about, you're nine or ten.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 36350
Speaker 1: But, now, do you remember the assassination of Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Okay, so, we were living in Bryn Mawr Park, Virginia.  So this is after my dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] came back from the Command and General Staff College [CGSC] at Fort Leavenworth [Kansas] that year.  We moved back to Alexandria [Virginia].  We moved to 6320 Phyllis Lane in Bryn Mawr Park, which is off of Edsel (ph.) Road, in Alexandria [Virginia].  And I'm building a watch on you here, but my, the thing I remember about that, we were the first black family to live in that neighborhood.  And I don't know if my--if you heard this from my father, but it was, you know, the way he, just the way he got that house is they didn't realize he was black until it was too late.  He didn't get it through a real estate agent.  I think he worked it through the Pentagon or something to, a direct buy from a previous owner that happened to be military.  So I had good friends there.  I had a wonderful experience there, but I also had a cross burned in my yard.  And I was there, fifth grade, sixth grade, seventh grade--well, I was there fifth grade through my sophomore year of high school.  And then I moved just across the road to another place, you know, in that house.  And my dad went to Vietnam again, came back several times.
Story_ID: 36351
Speaker 1: But when Martin Luther King [Jr.], I can still recall it [his assassination in 1968], you know, because there were all these riots, 14th Street riots, down in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia]. I can remember getting in the car with my family and driving down and seeing it, you know, the aftermath of it, seeing the stores burnt out, seeing the plywood put up over the glass and then spray paint said "Soul Brother" on it.  That's what people would put on there to try to tell them this is a black-owned establishment, don't destroy it.  Sometimes they did obey that, and most of the time they didn't.  So it was a really tumultuous time.  I remember how it affected me in school because generally speaking, you know, when I went to that, the--I went to Bryn Mawr Park Elementary School.  I went to Oliver Wendell Holmes Intermediate School.  Generally, speaking, real small number of black kids, mostly white people in those two schools.  And, generally, everybody would--got along well there.  But when things like that happened, it just really, just raises awareness of the, the issues that still exists in our society, the disharmony.  It was very disturbing as a young kid who had, who was operating as if color doesn't matter, to have that happen, and then that's a shocker.  Yes, it does, you know.  So that's what, I do remember that vividly.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so--
Speaker 1: So that was--was that '68 [1968], seven [1967]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1968--
Speaker 1: '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: April 4th, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I was, yeah, so I would have been ten [years old], no eleven at the time.  So that would have probably put me in about--I'm trying to remember if I was in fifth or sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Probably fifth, yeah.
Speaker 1: I definitely remember I was at Bryn Mawr Elementary School.
Speaker 2: Did the school do anything special to commemorate?
Speaker 1: I do not recall them doing anything special.  Matter of fact, I'm sure they did not, in fact.
Speaker 2: Now, that's an interesting thing, when you reflect back on that time that some, you know, in the black community, things were done that were special, and colleges, most colleges did something, you know, whether they were all white or mostly--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --they did something.  But a lot of the schools, I mean the regular public schools or other institutions that didn't feel an affinity for--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Dr. King, didn't do anything.
Speaker 1: I did not, I don't recall anything of that magnitude, anything being done of any kind of significance, other than people just being--I can recall everybody being worried, black community and white community, that, you know, that, man, I hope, I mean here's this man that was really making a difference and galvanizing people in a really positive way and, and getting international support for the changes he was making and causing the president of the United States to pay attention to the agenda that he was advocating for, which was equal rights.  And, in fact, my Aunt Nellie, the one I told you about, my father's older sister who was inducted into the African American Hall of Fame for Alexandria, she was at the famous speech down there on the Mall.  She was there.  She took my two cousins and she knew it was something important she had to be at.
Speaker 2: The 1963 March on Washington speech?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, and, I mean so, I mean I still, I remember her--she actually talked about that in her presentation, in her remarks at the Hall of Fame thing, about how important that was and to be there and be part of that.  But, yeah, I--that was a really tragic day.
Story_ID: 36352
Speaker 1: When you think about the early days of growing up, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: One of the sights--one of the sounds is my dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] whistling.  My dad was a, is a man that loves using his hands.  My brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker], my sister [Marquita Karen Brooks] and I, all of us know how to use a toolbox.  We know how to use tools.  We're all handy.  I mean it comes down from my father's father [Houston George Brooks].  I told you he was a carpenter and painter and as was his father.  And so, my dad loved doing things himself, a wood project, making a picnic table.  I can recall him making a picnic table and painting, and I can still hear him whistling because when he was enjoying something and maybe he was in solitude working on it in the backyard with his tools.  And he was in his own element, he would whistle, and he'd just be whistling a tune out there, and I can still hear him doing that.  I can, my mother [Naomi Lewis Brooks] always made a mean macaroni and cheese.  I could smell her macaroni and cheese.  I can smell my grandmother Brooks [Evelyn Brooks], my father's mother, my grandmother, made the most incredible apple pie with cinnamon, I mean just unbelievable.  I can recall going fishing a lot.  My dad used to take my brother and I, especially fishing.  We'd fish the Potomac [River], we fished the Chesapeake Bay.  It's something he grew up doing, and it's something that we did a lot too, growing up fishing on the water.
Story_ID: 36668
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about sights and sounds and smells of growing up.  So we've covered a lot of places.  One thing your brother [Vincent Brooks, also a HistoryMaker] emphasized was that, is the proximity to Alexandria [Virginia] and all the relatives in that part of Virginia that you had access to growing up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, that's well said.  I mean another one of the things I--it's still to this day.  We are a very supportive and tight family.  We have always had family around, and now that we've gotten older, family will go to support another family member when there's something to celebrate or something to support in mourning or whatever.  And so you're right.  I can recall, you know, going to these Quander reunions and just having a ton of relatives around, going to my--on my father's [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] side, going, we would go down to my Aunt Nellie's house.  They had a house with a lot of land around it down off of Route 1.  And in the summertime, we'd have, all my father's siblings, all their children and just have the best time with the cookout and food and potato salad and fried chicken and hamburgers and I--that is some of the best times I've ever had now that I think back about that.  Those, those kinds of family focused events as a young kid.  We used to, I have a cousin who is a year older than me, who lives in Alexandria and very often we would, in the summer, my brother and I would go stay at his house for a week.  And then he'd come stay at our house for a week, and we'd get into all kinds of mischief, doing stuff together as kids.  And so I have real fond memories of that.  And we would take 45 records, have a stack of 45 records.  We'd each have a hair brush in our hand, and would be acting like we're 'The Temptations' singing to 45 records down in the basement of his house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fond memories of that.
Story_ID: 36669
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in school, I mean did you like school?
Speaker 2: I always enjoyed school.  I had, you know--the first teacher that I had that really had a very significant impact on me was a lady by the name of Adeline Waters.  And Ms. Waters was at Bryn Mawr Elementary School [Bryn Mawr Park, Virginia].  She taught me fifth grade.  She was very hard on me.  I probably spent as much time standing in the hallway being punished as I spent sitting in the classroom.  And I, and what I'll never forget about it, one time I (laughter), I had to go in the hallway for being--'cause I was sort of the class clown.  And one day I was put in the hallway, and as I'm standing in the hallway, I look across the hall, there's my brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker] standing in the hallway from his class (laughter) at the same moment.  But Ms. Waters, I actually used to have 'em, I actually found my report cards from when I was in, as far back as second grade.  And my, I--you know, as an older student, high school student, junior high school student, I was a very good student, all As and Bs.  All, and I ended up getting into West Point [United States Military Academy].  When I was in fifth grade, fourth, fifth grade, not the case.  You know, I was a struggling student.  I turned around in that time period, I think, because Adeline Waters gave me focus, gave me, you know, let me know I wasn't just--she wasn't gonna allow me not to live up to the potential that I had.
Speaker 1: Now, what was going on in your family then 'cause your brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker] told a similar story, that he was clowning around until maybe the same age.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, so I think that a couple of things.  So my dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] had been in Vietnam one year.  Then he was in school a year.  Now, we're coming there.  So, you know, so he was gone a lot, you know.  So my mom's [Naomi Lewis Brooks] having to do all this by herself.  She's a teacher.  So we were latch-key kids, you know.  So we're kind of doing our own homework on our own a little bit there during that time period.  She certainly would come home and help, but, you know, we were kind of growing up in the afternoon on our own.  The, my sister [Marquita Karen Brooks] would--my mom would take my sister with her when she went to teach, leave her at a place where, after her little preschool or whatever it was.  Then, you know, they turned it into a daycare thing until she could bring her home.  And then, but one, that school, I mean, and that particular teacher, they would--she was just very focused on that.  And here's the, here's just a providential thing that happened.  So I loathed Ms. Waters 'cause she was so hard on me, you know.  I mean I was like, oh, God, I can't, thank God, I'm finally done with fifth grade.  I go back, my sixth grade year.  Ms. Waters has changed grades from fifth to sixth grade, and I got her again.  And my mom will tell you this story.  I actually cried 'cause I was gonna have to spend another year with Ms. Waters.  But Ms. Waters got me in shape.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you realize that at the time, you know?
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was, that was somebody being mean (laughter).  But, but it, in reflection, by the time I was say, maybe eighth [grade], I did realize it.  But that lady had a, she was a really strong teacher.  She's deceased now, but really strong teacher, strong influence who was not gonna allow me--I like to think that my class clown kind of attitude, you know, if you think about it, so I kind of put it on my father's side, right.  So I got a vaudevillian great grandfather ["Pap"; Henry Brooks].  I got a grandfather [Houston George Brooks] who's a preacher, so I'm not saying that's a class clown, but that's somebody who is comfortable talking and being around people, all right, and I got my father who is a military guy--his nickname by the way when he was in college was "Rev," you know, 'cause, you know, so he was always a gregarious, outgoing person, you know.  So I mean I think that just flowed to me and my brother in terms of how, the kind of way we interacted with people.  And, you know, we liked to get attention in the classroom, I guess, a little bit too much.  But, but that was a very, very important time for me in terms of getting focused.
Story_ID: 36670
Speaker 1: Now, then my dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] was in--when I was in seventh grade, let's see, it was either seventh or eighth grade--I'm getting the years mixed up.  But my dad was either there in the Pentagon or he had gone to Vietnam again.  And the thing I remember about that time period, that's Oliver Wendell Holmes Intermediate School, was now I'm seeing the height of Vietnam.  We're at the height of Vietnam now.  This is probably '69 [1969], something like that and listening to all the kids who were just kind of going along with all the protests and things of that nature.  They're formative ages, 'cause they're young, pre-teens, and I know my father's over there, you know.  And these people are basically opposing what my dad is doing, which I remember the struggle of--internally, of dealing with that.  It was sort of in this time period too when I got into athletics.  Like, I can recall when I was, I--my very first organized athletic activity was T-Ball in Bryn Mawr Park [Elementary School] in fifth grade.  I was forced to do it.  I didn't wanna do it because I loved playing out in the woods and doing individual things.  Fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth grade, end up playing baseball, end up playing football in youth leagues.  I can recall really enjoying both of those sports, baseball and football, football more than baseball.  And then when I went to high school, then, so it was natural for me.  I wanted to play football.
Speaker 2: Okay, so did you have an idol in football?  I mean anybody that was a pro or--
Speaker 1: Absolutely, my idol, unquestionably, was Larry Brown, Number 43, Washington Redskins, running back.  I was a running, you know, when I was in high school [Thomas Jefferson High School], I was a running back.  I wore Number 43.  I, I had Larry Brown's poster over my bed in my room, big three foot by four foot poster.  And as an adult, matter of fact, as a vice president in Boeing, I actually hosted, co-hosted a golf tournament, and Larry Brown was playing in it.  And so at the end of the golf tournament, which is a fun thing to support D.C. [District of Columbia] College, it's call D.C. College Access program which was what it was, and this organization provides scholarships to D.C. youth.  And so a lot of D.C. former athletes help support that golf tournament, so celebrity golf tournament.  Larry Brown was there.  And I was making some remarks, and I told him, I said--in front of all these people, I said, Larry, you don't know it, but you and I have slept together (laughter) because, you know, his poster was above my bed.  And he got the most bizarre look on his face, like okay, what--(laughter).  What's that all about?  Anyway, so I was a big Larry Brown fan.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember Larry Brown having a lot of determination.  A couple of games, he just, he played through an injury or something and really was just--
Speaker 1: Well, the guy--and I really tried to, I wanted to try to emulate that guy on the football field.  So if you ever look at highlight reels of him, he was just, what you call, reckless abandon.  He just go after it hard.  He would attack a linebacker that was twice his size and run right, try to run right through 'em.  He'd, you know, he--one person couldn't tackle Larry Brown, you know.  He, like you said, he was a tough running back, who, you know, could deal with, you know, fighting through adversary, pain.  And he was so talented and gifted.  So I always loved Larry Brown.
Speaker 2: Okay, your father said you were a running back.  So that's what you, you patterned yourself after Larry Brown.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yep, absolutely.
Speaker 2: And became pretty good.
Speaker 1: Yep, so, in high school, I was a football player and I ran track.  Those are the two sports I played.  Actually, one year, I actually wrestled, my sophomore year.  I, and I only did that because they were just starting indoor track in Northern Virginia.  They didn't have it when I was a sophomore, so I wrestled, and then my junior year, I ran indoor track and outdoor track, plus the football, but--
Speaker 2: So this was--I'm sorry, this was the Jefferson High School?
Speaker 1: This was Thomas Jefferson High School.
Story_ID: 36671
Speaker 1: So I graduated, when I finished Oliver Holmes Junior High [Northern Virginia], that school fed into Thomas Jefferson High School which is now a big science and technology magnet school.  At the time, it was a regular high school.  And so I was, it was interesting.  I, I can vividly recall my weights as I grew in size, which is kind of astounding when you think about it.  When I was a freshman, I was ninety-nine pounds on the roster.  And so I was a little light, tailback, but I was fast and played freshman football.  Then moved up to the JV [junior varsity] towards the end of the season.  And then the one story I'll tell about my dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] that I will never forget was when I was a sophomore, I was playing JV football.  And they were gonna move me up to the varsity.  And I had a quiz in health, regular old quiz in health.  It wasn't even worth a whole lot.  My dad who came, who was in the Pentagon and came home from the Pentagon and something caught his attention, i.e., is that I had not done my homework or practiced for--or studied for this quiz.  And he told me--this was a great honor for me to get elevated to the varsity from JV--and he told me I'm off the team.  It was the last game of the season.  I was being pulled, he was pulling me off the team because I did not have my priorities straight, that studying was more important than thinking only about this thing, wasn't gonna let me play.  And I was devastated.  I missed like one practice 'cause my, you know, when he said you're out.  So I got mad about something.  So I took the quiz, whenever it was given at school.  I got a hundred [100].  I can remember calling him at work, saying I got a hundred on that quiz, and he said, okay, all right, well, maybe I overreacted.  You can play.  Well, but I've already missed a practice and everything, and I'm the little kid coming up, you know, so I--what they were gonna have me do which was return kick-offs and things of that nature, you know, I didn't get to do, but I got, you know, I got to get in for a few plays anyway.  So, that was a traumatic thing for me when I was a sophomore.  I, I'll never forget that.  The, then as a junior, I was a running back and I became pretty accomplished then, was going well for the team, doing well as a running back, got mentioned in several news articles with, you know, and then my dad--one of the things I'll never forget is my father--and I don't wanna just talk about my dad because my mom [Naomi Lewis Brooks] was always supportive of me too, but my dad, as an [U.S.] Army officer, with all the things that they had to do, he missed one game in my four years of high school football.  My parents, both of 'em, incredibly supportive of things that I did, and my brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker] too and my sister [Marquita Karen Brooks], right.  So that was, my passion was football.  Now, they were on me about, you know, the most important thing for you is grades, academics.  But they knew that my passion was football.
Story_ID: 36672
Speaker 1: And, and so the thing that devastated me then was is I found out in my junior year [at Thomas Jefferson High School, Northern Virgiia], towards the end of my junior year, spring, I'm looking forward to a senior year.  I'm thinking about going to play [football] in college and doing some other things in that area.  And my dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] gets orders to go to Sacramento, California.  And I also was a triple jumper and a high hurdler in track.  I had placed fifth in the region, Northern Virginia region, in the triple jump, as a junior.  I had won gold medals in AAU [Amateur Athletic Union], and I was really looking forward to, you know--most of the guys that were ahead of me were graduating.  I was gonna be "the" man, you know, and then I had to move to California.  I can remember vividly opposing that.  And it was a big struggle in our family because, you know, one could make the argument, I had gone from fifth grade through my junior year of high school in the same spot, unheard of for a military kid, right.  I grew up with all the same kids, fifth grade through my junior year at high school.  And I said, I had friends whose parents were willing to let me stay with them to finish my senior year, which to me made sense.  And I can remember that debate going on for a while and my dad saying, we're not gonna break up our family any faster than we have to.  And so, you're going.  And it ended up being a blessing in disguise because what ended up happening is, just like anything, right, I ended up going to Sacramento, California.  There, the public schools were not very good academically, at least the one I would have gone to, which would have been Hiram Johnson High School. So the person my father was replacing recommended that we look at going to the local Jesuit High School, and a couple things happened out of that that were really important.  So first thing that happened was is, the rumors started floating out to Jesuit High School, like I was a good football player.  But I wasn't an All-American or anything of that nature, right, but the rumors were floating around out there like, hey, we got this All-American coming out here from Virginia, you know.  So--
Speaker 2: So you--
Speaker 1: --so I came in with a, you know, good credentials as it were to play at their--the second thing that happened to me was, is when I was in Virginia, I was solely an offensive running back, you know.  That's what I did.  When I got to California, I--maybe initially because they thought I was, you know, this super hero or whatever, they were training me to play both ways.  I was the outside linebacker and I was a running back, tailback.  And the thing that I remember about that was, is in the end, I actually--I mean I spent all that time being a running back growing up.  I loved being an outside linebacker so much more.  It was so much fun.  I enjoyed it, and actually won a big award for it, which, you know, it's still out there.  I actually went out there as a brigadier general in the [U.S.] Army and spoke at that high school, and saw my--the award with my name on it, called "The Iron Man Award" for being the toughest, hardest hitter, right.
Story_ID: 36673
Speaker 1: And so that was a, that was an interesting time to move out there at that phase of my life, to a, again, a very homogenous environment.  There were, I think, three black people in my entire school [Jesuit High School, Sacramento, California], two of them being me and my brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker], you know.  I'm now being exposed to something I'd never been exposed to.  For example, I grew up a Baptist.  I'm going to a Catholic High School, so I'm going to Mass before football games and things like that.  I'm learning about another faith that I had never really been exposed to.  It was very eye opening, very enlightening for me.  And it was a really good experience, and it was really good also in terms of, that was a college prep high school.  Almost everybody that went to that high school came out of there and went to college.  And the other thing that happened, at that high school is, it was a--just like a lot of big named parochial schools, they were, they used to dominate at sports.  And so I went from Thomas Jefferson [High School, Northern Virginia], which was mediocre in sports.  You know, we were, you know, we were mediocre in football as a team, to going out to there where, you know, you're playing in, you know, big games, things that count on a really good team out there, so both in track and in football.
Story_ID: 36674
Speaker 1: So when you look back on your sports experiences in school, do you think, how do you think they influenced your life as a career military officer?
Speaker 2: Oh, significantly.  So, again, my primary sports were football and track.  Football is a team sport.  Nobody can do anything just by themselves.  And the events I, the positions I played totally depended upon that, you know.  I can't shoot a gap and go after somebody if a defensive tackle doesn't do what he's supposed to do to, you know, to--if I charge in to try to stop an option, I gotta count on a quarterback that's gonna come up behind me to take the pitch man if I go for the quarterback, all those kinds of things.  I mean you learn to trust, depend upon your teammate.  I learned out there, I'll tell you what, that was tough football in Northern California.  And fighting through adversity, fight--you know, the summer, the blood, sweat and tears of working to becoming a champion.  I mentioned to you that I had, I was in a program in Virginia which really wasn't all that good as a sports program.  And in California, I was in a very good program.  The difference in terms of the intensity of our commitment to win was totally different.  Out there it was, you know, well, yeah, we're gonna win.  It's just, you know, we're, we're honing our skills so we continue to maintain a winning tradition as opposed to in Virginia, it might have been, I hope we can win some, you know, this year.  In track, it was more individual, you know.  Again, I was a high--triple jumper.  I was long jumper, and I was a high hurdler.  And, you know, that's, that was my individual skill solely, and it's on display.  You know, if I win, I win, and everybody sees it.  If I come in last, everybody sees that.  So, but again that total dedication of, you know, it wasn't just some skill in terms of can you catch or whatever.  This is, I had to hone my body to be able to be, you know, either faster, have more endurance, have more strength, more power, in order to dominate whoever else I was gonna complete against in those sports, in those events.  I've--sports were very important in my life, still are from that aspect.
Story_ID: 36675
Speaker 1: What about coaches and such?  I mean were they mentors or--
Speaker 2: So, so when I was in--I'll go back, if you don't mind, I'll go back a couple of coaches when I think of coaches.  I had a coach when I was youth league.  His name was Buddy.  I don't even know what his last name was.  But anyway, Buddy, when I was probably sixth grade, used to tell me that I wouldn't, I wouldn't amount to much.  He was very negative.  And I can always recall feeling down and like I couldn't, like you know, every--the world was on my shoulders and that I, you know, I'd never be successful because Buddy said I wouldn't be.  And then something happened that was very interesting.  So when I got into high school, I had this guy.  He says, ah, you're not gonna make it, you know.  When I got into high school, again, I was very fast, small, I was ninety-nine pounds [weight] when I started high school.  By the time I was, in my second year, I can remember vividly, I was 126 [pounds].  As a junior, I was 152.  As a senior, I was 165.  So my senior year, I was 165 pounds (unclear).  So I grew sixty-six pounds from my freshmen year football to my senior year football, in those four years.  So anyway, I had this real negative experience with that guy.  It wasn't reinforcing.  And when I was at Thomas Jefferson [High School, Northern Virginia], I had a coach by the name of Rayburn, Coach Rayburn.  Coach Rayburn was a good influence on me as a man.  We weren't, wasn't, I won't say we had the best, wasn't the best coach, but he was a, he had a good influence on me in terms of being a good, decent human.  Now, you're talking that time period, remember this is 1971-ish, '72 [1972] time period, a lot of racial strife.  Some of that manifested itself in my high school a little bit.  We had a small group of African American students, very, you know, maybe fifty, you know, out of a population of 1,000 or so.  That group tended to sit together in the mess hall, I mean in the cafeteria or wherever, right.  Well, I'm an athlete.  So I'm sitting with my friends, you know, my teammates.  I can recall vividly one time where my coach had heard a rumor that somebody had called me an ethnic slur, called me in and asked me.  He says, hey, did someone call you a chocolate drop or something like that.  That's exactly what he said.  I can still hear him saying it.  I go, Coach, what are you talking about?  And what somebody had said was is, said, you're a reverse, says we got a reverse Oreo here.  One white guy was on one side of me and one white guy was on the other side of me.  And I'm black in the middle, and says, we got a reverse Oreo here.  He heard that.  That rumor got back to him and he was, you know, he wasn't having anything to do with that.  So he was like really on, making sure we didn't have, you know, we were focused on team, individuals being collective as a group, not racial stuff.  But so he was a decent influence as a human, not a great coach.  Bob Seveari (ph.) was my coach in, when I was in Sacramento [California].
Speaker 1: At Jesuit.
Speaker 2: At Jesuit, Jesuit High School.  That's where I learned about being a winner.
Story_ID: 36676
Speaker 1: And also my track coach and I'm drawing blanks on his name, but I'll tell you a story.  My brother, Vince [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker], can fill you in on this 'cause he's the one that told me about this.  So, I told you I was a triple jumper.  I was a long jumper, and a high hurdler.  Well, they were gonna have, they started to have the 330 intermediate hurdles.  It was sort of a new event back then.  Now, they got the 400s, but now it was 330s.  And so my coach said to me, hey, I want you to run that.  I said, I've never run that in my life.  He goes, ah, it's just a regular dual meet, you know, between us and another school.  But why don't you run it?  And so, I mean that takes a lot of, you're basically running a quarter mile and jumping over, you know, a bunch of hurdles.  So the thing I'll never forget about it was the two coaches were standing there in the infield of the track, near where I was.  I was in Lane 1, and I started out, when the gun went off, I took off way too fast.  And I made up the stagger on virtually everybody before I even got in the turn, you know, before I even got 200 yards.  I came out of the turn, and my, the coach--one coach said to the other coach--my brother was there watching this 'cause he was on the track team too.  He says, he's going too fast.  He's going out too fast, and then the head coach said, but he's winning.  And I ended up winning that meet, but the last two hurdles, I was like crawling, but I had made such a distance that as people started to close on me, you know, I mean I was able to get across the finish line, you know, and win even though, you know, I had done that.  And so the next thing you know, I'm running that in the regionals (laughter), you know, that particular event.  But, but--
Speaker 2: But you run it at a different pace (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, and starting out at a different pace.  And then, you know, literally, what I recall is then is, 'cause I was brand new at it, but I did well in it, and I qualified to run in the regionals in that event.  I just naturally fitted.  It, and I'm a senior.  So I didn't really get the prep for it.  They would literally put a coach at about 190 yards out, and he'd say, you know, when I got near him in the race, he'd say, now, now, now, now, you know, telling me, now, accelerate, you know.  He said, just keep pace with the pack when you get there, and then accelerate, you know.  And so I could--that's how they trained me to be a 330 hurdler.
Story_ID: 36362
Speaker 1: Now, what about academics?  You say you kind of turns the corner, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in junior high school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And started making much better grades.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So were you taking the hard sciences in high school?  Were you--
Speaker 2: So, in high school, I took the--I didn't really take a bunch of AP [advanced placement] courses that I recall in high school.  But I then, but I started again, as a result of some of the work of Adeline Waters with me, and the realization instilled in me by my parents [Leo Brooks, Sr. and Naomi Lewis Brooks] that, hey, you know, if you're gonna go to a good college, you're gonna have to have some grade and having a bunch of Cs and Ds isn't gonna get it.  And so I, it was really motivation partly, I would say of my parents instilling in me that, you know, all this stuff we did in elementary school doesn't count.  It's a freebie.  Once you start ninth grade and you start building your transcript for college, that counts.  Okay, that, and so I don't think I ever got a C the entire time I was in high school.  I don't recall getting a C, certainly not end grade, maybe, you know, a quarter in one thing, almost never.  So I just really put my nose to the grindstone in terms of focusing on, on my eye on the prize.  And my eye on the prize was being able to give myself the best possibility of going to a college I wanted to go to.  You know, when I was in high school there in Virginia, you know, I wanted to go to Ohio State [University] 'cause I wanted to play football.  You know, and back then, you know, everything was, Ohio State was national champions and everything was Ohio State, and that's where I wanted to go.
Speaker 1: Was that the age of Archie Griffin and--
Speaker 2: That was before Archie Griffin.
Speaker 1: Before Archie, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: You know, and I just loved Ohio State, and my parents were Ohio residents at that time because when they moved to Xenia [Ohio] earlier, they kept that residency because they didn't have state tax or whatever.  And, you know, I mean I was Ohio resident almost until I went to college.  And so I focused on good, on getting my grades.  I got, I did well in school.  I always struggled--it's interesting, I always kind of was mediocre in math.  Part of the reason I think I was mediocre in math then, and I ended up being, it ended up being a strong thing for me later in life.  But it was because my head football coach was my math teacher.  And I can recall, and this is in Virginia, when I was a junior, and when I should have been buckling down on my math work, I can recall vividly having my friends say to me, hey, get him talking about the game next week against Woodson.  And if I were to say in the classroom to the head football coach who lived and breathed football, if I were to say to him, "Coach, how are we gonna defend against that Vere (ph.), you know, that Vere offense next week?"  Instead of doing math, he'd be drawing, you know, football symbols on the board and we'd spend forty minutes talking about that and five minutes talking about, you know, trigonometry or whatever.  So I literally was not well prepared.  Then I went to Sacramento [California; Jesuit High School], and now we're talking about a really strong college prep program.  I mean that's, it was just focused.  And there, I mean those folks, they took a dull knife, okay, I was a good student.  Again, I got all As and Bs, but I would say the rigor in that program was good, but it--in Virginia, but it wasn't top notch rigor.  The Jesuits, that was, that was top-notch education, focused, and, you know, specificity and demand for excellence.  And, you know, I excelled there.  I just needed to be pushed.  And very, very much that was an important thing for me, educationally.
Story_ID: 36363
Speaker 1: I applied to West Point [United States Military Academy].  I applied to several other schools in Ohio because my parents [Leo Brooks, Sr. and Naomi Lewis Brooks] were Ohio residents.
Speaker 2: I think Bowling Green was one.
Speaker 1: Bowling Green, Bowling Green State University, Ohio University.  I had a couple of colleges looking at me for football, Boise State [University], University of Hawaii, Rice [University], [United States] Air Force Academy, West Point, all were looking at me for football.  So I had all those things kind of in the mix.  I applied, so what is interesting is, I had a, I got accepted to West Point.  And I, and when I did, my parents were just doing back flips, you know, like, ah, this awesome, this is great and everything.  And I wasn't sure I was gonna go.  I just wanted to apply--my dad said, why don't you just apply to see if you can get in.  It was sort of like a measuring of how well you are academically compared to the rest of the nation.
Speaker 2: So you weren't, it wasn't your childhood dream to be a general or be--
Speaker 1: Not then.
Speaker 2: --in the military?
Speaker 1: Not then, not when I was in my senior year [in high school].  And I also had, you gotta remember, I had the influence of--I'm going to a Jesuit High School in California, very liberal.  And I can recall one of my teachers who was a good man that really liked me as a person, right.  And he said to me--I can still remember this conversation.  He goes, you're such a free spirit.  You have such a wonderful soul and it's free, and it's open and you're engaging, and why do you wanna go to the military and have 'em put you in a box and make you constrained and rigid and was actively trying to get me not to do it.  And I, I actually told 'em at one point that I'm gonna decline.  And to this day, I'm not sure what happened, but I had, I mean I had said I think I'm gonna decline.  Then after thinking about it a day, called 'em back, and said, hey, I don't wanna--I'm not gonna decline.  And, you know, I still got my, you know, appointment.
Speaker 2: What was the deciding factor?
Speaker 1: I was thinking all that.  So I had kind of decided for myself, I was thinking about some of these other places. I thought about Boise State serious, but I, you know, to me it was too isolated for me to go to Idaho, okay, and do that.  But, you know, it has a good, even then, decent football program.  University of Hawaii seemed exotic, but it was way too far away.  I was very seriously thinking about Rice [University].  The Air Force Academy, one of their coaches actually came to my high school and so I was, I was very enamored with that because this guy came to my school and wanted to talk to me and told me he'd fly me out to the Air Force Academy to see the grounds.  His name was Spike Holstrom (ph.).  I still remember his name.  And anyway, the, and my dad said, don't make any commitments, don't make any commitments.  So I don't know he just wanted me to focus on West Point and (unclear).  He said, don't make any commitments.  And he says, let's get an Air Force--'cause there are two Air Force bases near where we lived in Sacramento.  He says, let's get an Air Force guy, colonel, to tell you about what it's like to be a Air Force pilot because you wear glasses, and you're--and you can't be a command pilot.  And that guy, whoever he got, basically told me, he says, you can go to the Air Force Academy, and you're gonna, you know, and you will graduate, and you'll great things, but you're gonna be a navigator or, you know, or something in the support side.  And the people that run the Air Force are command pilots.  And you can never be one because of your glasses.  And, and so he said, so, instead of going to the school that is totally focused on creating pilots--at least how, it was explained to me, why would you do that.  So, you know, so I chose not to do that.  The West Point thing, West Point had somebody come see me too, two people actually.  The track coach came to see me and another recruiter came to see me and came to my home.  So I think that personal attention had something to do with it too, you know, that they really wanted me to, you know, come play football, run track there.
Story_ID: 36364
Speaker 1: But in the end I didn't think--probably maybe because of Mr. Novak [at Jesuit High School], I didn't think I wanted my free spirit, as it were described, as it was described to me, to be, you know, contained 'cause I was enjoying myself as a senior in high school.  And I did like my friends, and I did have solid friends, which is another story about my friendships there in one were strong than the ones I had with all the kids I grew up from fifth grade through junior high school.  We can talk about that in a minute if you like.  But the, the bottom line is, we had such--when I had an appointment, I said I'm gonna go to Bowling Green [State University].  It's in Ohio, it's in my home state.  They wanted me to play football there too.  It would just be easy, and, you know, I'd be playing at a level there, in a league that would be sort of along my capabilities of how I was as an athlete.  And then the more I thought about it, my dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker], you know, my father kind of influenced me a little bit.  He goes, you know, I am not gonna--he always said, I'm not gonna try to influence you.  And he really didn't.  But one of the things, he did do what he's done all his life is, and that is make sure you understand the ramifications of your choices.  And he says, okay, just make sure you understand what you're giving up, you know.  And I thought about that a little bit, and then I kind of changed my mind and said, nah, I'm gonna go to West Point [United States Military Academy].  And so that was a, the best decision I ever made in my life.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so this is 1975?
Speaker 1: 1975, June, 1975.
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 36365
Speaker 1: So, now, did you graduate from high school [Jesuit High School, Sacramento, California] with honors, I mean from high school with honors?
Speaker 2: I was, yes, okay.  So I did graduate with honors, you know, from high school.  I had, so I had my West Point [United States Military Academy] appointment.  I had the, I was--in sports, I had the Iron Man Award, and then I was an honor student as well, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I did, by that time, so once, so you could see an article--if you were to go back and research an article in the 'Sacramento Bee' about me, this was an interesting thing, I didn't know that I was gonna serve a lifetime, but I did have tremendous respect for what my dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] did in the military and his example, right.  And I, it was very comfortable with the military because I witnessed it all my life.  And I, so the high school, the article I remember from high school about me going off to West Point, said, and when asked what he wants to be, he said he wanted to become an Airborne Infantry Officer, which is what I ended up becoming.  And that was in, you know, 1975, before I even went.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right, so West Point, did your whole family go out to West Point with you?
Speaker 2: That was (laughter), you know, I had been on one airplane in my entire life, and it was when I was an infant, so I don't even remember it, prior to that.  And so my family took me, I mean here I'm going to this very scary thing going off to West Point.  They pull up, and took me down to put me on the airplane.  I flew, I guess, I think it was out of San Francisco [California], I flew out to--my parents put me on the plane, and I left everybody and went off by myself, flew out to Newark, New Jersey where my dad's oldest brother, Houston, picked me up to drive me up to West Point.  I was scared to death.  I still remember the plane.  It was a terrible, bumpy ride or at least it seemed that way.  The plane had to do a go-around when it came in to land 'cause I thought it was almost over, and it had to come back around and land again.  So this was my flight in like, you know, 12, 13 years or 14 years, and I'm seventeen [years old].  And then my uncle on the drive from Newark to up there is about, you know, about an hour and ten minutes, hour and fifteen minutes, my uncle, as he's driving me up there, he had served in World War II at the end of the war, you know, as a private, you know.  And my uncle would say, giving me all this counseling, "Now, let me tell you how to do this. Don't take any crap off those people," you know, that kind of stuff.  So that was the kind of counsel I got from my uncle.  So he drove me up, took me to where I got inducted, and dropped me off and left (laughter).  I was on my own.
Speaker 1: Now, is this your father's brother, the--
Speaker 2: That's my father's oldest brother.
Speaker 1: Oh, the chemist?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: All right, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So he experienced what it was like in the old Army before it was integrated, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, so he came in--he was drafted.  I mean so, I mean here's a guy, I mean he's a Ph.D.  He had a Ph.D. [degree].  He got drafted as a private as a Ph.D.  I mean he had, I mean he was a, I think he even already had it or he was in his last phase of his doctoral work, and he got drafted (laughter).  It was towards the end of the war.  I wanna say it was like '44 [1944], '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 36366
Speaker 1: All right, so, well, what was West Point [United States Military Academy] like?  What was the initial reaction to West Point?
Speaker 2: Completely overwhelming.  I mean I'm an athlete.  I know I can physically do anything all these other people could do.  But the, and I'm used to team sports and things of that nature.  But it was so overwhelming.  Everything was, I wasn't used to the exact precision that they were demanding.  I wasn't used to the total negative motivation that, back in those days, they would try to do to try to, you know, build your character, build your spine, right, in terms of yelling at you and making you hold your neck back and doing things of that nature.  It was all games, but at--to the person going through it, you don't think it is.  So one of the things I remember doing very, very, right away is, one you have to really bond close with your teammates, or you'll never get through it.
Speaker 1: Now, this historically, has been, had been very difficult for blacks students at West Point--
Speaker 2: You bet.
Speaker 1: --just recently, before the time that you arrived?
Speaker 2: You bet, when I--
Speaker 1: Historically, the--
Speaker 2: When I was there, I mean obviously, there were numerous black graduates before me, but, you know, we're not talking large numbers.  When I was there I think maybe there was eighty in the class of 4,000, I'm guessing, somewhere in that, somewhere in that neighborhood.  And because young people can be abusive, when not always supervised, just like at night and things like that, there was stuff that was totally wrong, you know, that happened up there.  And I mean, boy, it was really hard.  And one of the things I did, I really grew my faith up there.  I always grew up in the church.  But I was more of a, you know, I mean I went, you know, I worshiped on Sunday, you know, with my family.  I might have gone to Sunday School or something like that, you know.  I wouldn't say I was totally into it, you know, in terms of being focused as a Christian.  When I got there, you know, I mean I was looking for strength from anywhere, you know, and so I turned to church which was really good for me.  And I met one of the most influential people in my life there, Chaplin Richard Camp, and Chaplin Camp was the associate, wasn't the head.  He was the associate pastor up there for the Corps of Cadets.  And that guy, I can recall him always being there to give encouragement.  They would always be out in the field watching you train and things of that nature.  I can recall getting in Bible studies there, you know, as a fresh--plebe, as a freshman there.  I can recall the community putting their arms around me in that regard.  And that was very helpful to get through that first year which was very hard.  I, it was so hard, and to me, in essence, you know, I told you I went there to play football and run track.  It was so kind of overwhelming to me I said, you know, I don't think I can take on sports in terms of football as a freshman and get through here and my main objective is to graduate through here.  So the track coach took me, put--'cause again, I was recruited for that.  They put me on the cross country roster in the fall, even though I did not run cross country.  They put me on a cross country roster so I would have athlete status so they could work with me in terms of building muscle mass and workout and things like that as a soph--as a, in the fall.  That was a hard thing for me because when you're an athlete, fresh--you know, especially, freshmen, when some of your teammates are getting, your company mates in your company are having to do all kinds of things, playing a lot of these games that they would put you through, you're not there 'cause you're down at the track.  So then you come in later that evening, okay, 'cause you're an athlete, when you're in season, you know, they don't want you eating these little square meals and having games played with you, how you eat.  They want, you know, they're putting protein in you and things like that.  So you get to eat normal.  Well, your teammates--or your classmates, resent that, that you got that privilege, even though you're representing them inter-collegiately, right, but they tend to resent that.  The upper class, if they're not athletes, they don't like it 'cause they didn't get a chance to, you know, haze you more during the day.  So then what that would cause is, is at night, extra attention on Leo Brooks and the other kids that were athletes or freshmen the barracks.  That's where we'll go get even, you know, for not being able to get 'em during the afternoon or whatever, which really made me question if I wanted to stay there for a while as a freshman, you know--
Story_ID: 36367
Speaker 1: Did the athletes [at the United States Military Academy at West Point] have a bond themselves in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --matter of fact, I'll never forget, I had one guy come in and was very abusive.  You know, he didn't physically do anything, but just the way he was yelling at me and everything like that and then turned to another guy, my roommate and said, hey, man, how you doing?  You know, like nothing, right.  And I hate that man to this day (laughter), you know.  But I remember there was a track athlete that would--that guy that did that to me was a sophomore.  I was a freshman.  And I can recall going to a junior on the track team who was in my company and saying, hey, this guy, you know, did "x", "y" and "z."  A lot of it was racial in its undertones in terms of the kind of stuff he said.  And the guy I said it to was black.  And he was superior to this guy.  That guy's name was Cranny Butler--I don't mind saying his name.  So Cranson Butler, Cranson Butler looked at me, and he was totally professional.  It wasn't like he was giving me some break because I was black or because, you know, I was on the track team.  He looked at me, and he just had this look on his face.  He didn't even have to say anything.  He was like, he was like infuriated.  And he looked at me, and he goes, "Mr. Brooks, that will never happen again."  And I can recall saying to him, "Oh, don't say anything, don't say anything.  I don't wanna get in trouble."  He goes, "It will never happen again."  And he goes--and I implored him again, you know, "Don't, don't, don't get me in trouble."  And he says, "You just stay straight.  It will never happen again."  And he walked out and slammed the door.  And it never happened again (laughter).  That guy stayed away from me the rest of the time.  So, and it's just like that, I--there's, matter of fact, a guy who's a four-star general right now, in Africa, Dave Rodriguez, Dave Rodriguez was a senior in my company when I was a freshman, that same company.  Dave Rodriguez was an athlete.  He was a football player, and so Dave Rodriguez would just come by checking on the freshmen, but you know what he would do, I'll tell you.  That guy, I could tell back then he was gonna be a really strong leader because he would walk in a room, and he might barge in for theatrics, like all did, you know, it's just part of the game.  But then he'd kind of look around with this kind of scowl on his face, and he goes, "Brooks, how you doing?"  You know, and you'd be scared to death 'cause he's a big tall guy, 6'5" [height], whatever.  And I'd say, "Sir, I'm fine", and he goes, "You better be," and he'd turn around and walk out.  But, you know, it was more of a, messing with you, but at the same time, showing a little compassion in there, real good guy.  So anyway, so I think the athletes did kind of look out for some of the freshmen that were, that were athletes 'cause they probably had the same experience themselves when they were freshmen.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 36368
Speaker 1: Another person, very influential, so when I was a freshman, I had a tact, tactical officer.  Every company has a, you know, has a tactical officer.  And I will tell you when I was a freshman, my tactical officer was a major, and my ratings in terms of leadership potential, (unclear) things of that nature, were low.  And they were low for all those reasons I said, you know, my, I got--you know, you have peer ratings and things.  People penalized me for not being there, not suffering the same things they suffered for 'cause I was out running track, and I actually went from the cross country roster to the indoor tract roster in the winter, to the spring track roster in the spring.  So, you know, I still had to come back and serve and do things that everybody else did on my table--sitting at company tables.  But I spent more time away from my company than most of the other freshmen that weren't inter-collegiate athletes.
Speaker 2: So what were the--
Speaker 1: I was in season all year long.
Speaker 2: So were they drilling or something or doing some other kind of activities than you were?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I didn't do, I wasn't in parades, for example, because I was at track practice.  They'd be in parades, having to go to parades.  People did, having to deliver mail or deliver laundry and stuff like that.  And a lot of times--and the people that do that are freshmen.  I couldn't do it all the time because I was not physically present, right.  And I, understandably, as I look back on it, you know, I mean--and later, even when I became Commandant of Cadets, I always paid attention to that kind of thing.  Understandably, you know, some resented that, that why are you getting to get a break.  Well, okay, you don't see--it's easy for me to say this, and athletes all know this.  But, you know, it's easy to say, but, you know, yeah, well, how'd you like to go down and run, you know, six 440s, you know, under sixty-two seconds, you know.  And if you--and puking your guts out?  How'd you like to do that instead of delivering mail?  But they don't see that, right.  So it's not their fault.  They don't see that.  And you're doing this to represent them, you know.  So, so but they can't see that.  All they see, you know, my--you know, and so that was a problem.  So consequently, my rate, in the ratings, my tact said, this guy is marginal.  He's not gonna make it, you know.  You know, I don't think he's gonna be, you know, I had low ratings from him, this--and the tact is the guy who's taking assessments from the direct reports.  You know, the, my squad leader who was a junior, my platoon leader who was a senior, his own observations, his own counselings, they were all negative.  I'll never forget that.  They were negative.  I went to, that summer, that first summer, after you finish your freshman year, you go to this thing called Camp Buckner.  And when you go to Camp Buckner, you go as an individual.  You're scrambled.  My whole class went out there.  We went to, you know, we're all intermingled.  So I'm not with the same people I'm in my own company with, which was Company I-1.  We, I went to, you know, a company mixed with people from across all four regiments.  And I was just doing my thing, but I loved being outside I loved, this is living out in the environment, right.  I loved doing the military skills.  I loved shooting weapons.  I loved the physical challenges.  I was naturally good at that.  And I demonstrated leadership.  When I got put in a leadership role to do things, I did really well at it.  And I had a tactical officer there assigned to me, okay, who was not the same person I had during the regular year, right, because they're randomly chose to do that too.  And so here's what happened.  I'll never forget this.  So I start my sophomore year, and, you know, and I get a new tactical officer in my permanent unit, my permanent company.  And that tactical officer, his name was Peter J. Ammons, I'll never forget that guy, very influential in my life too.  Peter J. Ammons says, I don't get it.  Here's a rating from your whole freshman year that says, basically, you're a dirt bag, you're not gonna make it.  You don't have any leadership skills.  And then here's a rating for the summer that says, you're the best thing since sliced bread.  You're a natural-born leader.  How are these two things, how is this the same person?  He goes, I didn't even think it was the same person.
Story_ID: 36369
Speaker 1: So, you know, the, I had this, so I had this experience where as a freshman [United States Military Academy at West Point], I'm told that I'm no good, okay.  And I have no leadership potential.  My sophomore summer, beginning of my sophomore summer, I'm told you're just a, you know, this outstanding cadet with great leadership.  And then what happened, that was very fortuitous was, for me, was at the end of my freshman year, I was there during the big honor scandal, okay, of West Point.  Two monumental things in the history of West Point happened when I was a cadet--three actually, happened when I was a cadet.  The first one that happened earlier in my freshman year was one of my classmates was found to have violated the honor code.  And then through some kind of administrative oversight, that ruling of being found guilty was overturned.  And so that cadet then was shunned by the whole institution because he had violated the honor code.  He was found guilty of violating the honor code by the, his peers, cadets, and an honor--
Speaker 2: This was a white cadet, right?
Speaker 1: This was a white cadet.  And then, his name was Stephen Veer, and then that then brought upon the wrath of all cadets because they said, look, you--we don't let people because, when they violate the honor code.  But there was some kind of administrative procedure that allowed it.  That then led to literally, a 'Time' magazine cover about West Point and the honor code, and the honor system.  And whether it was legitimate or not that cadets are ruling on whether or not another student should stay or not, right.  And so, and it was the end, it always had some kind of oversight process, legal oversight process, but they're now more things that help govern it than there used to be.  So that was one monumental thing.  So we were in the front, we were on the cover of Time Magazine about our honor system and our honor code.  It was in the Washington--it was in the 'New York Times', every other week for months when that happened.  And then the next thing that happened--and that guy, that guy did eventually leave.  Then the next thing that happened was they made the announcement that women were gonna come to West Point.  I'm the last all-male class of the United States Military Academy, Class of '79 [1979].  And so we were going from an all-male institution to now this other monumental change where people are having to grasp with how they're gonna accept women coming into the academy.  Some were fine with it, some were adamantly against it, both administration and student body, some didn't know how to process it.  I was sort of, you know, I was sort in that vein.  I was fine with 'em coming, but I, you know, I didn't know how to process it.  I didn't have deep roots at West Point where, you know, of five generations or whatever of legacy where any change would be viewed as wrong.  And I also kind of viewed it like, well, you know, people were probably saying the same thing when they first admitted blacks.  So, you know, so I kind of looked at it like that as well.  So then that occurred.
Story_ID: 36370
Speaker 1: And then in the spring of my freshman year [at the United States Military Academy at West Point], right before the year ended, we had a big, we had a major honor scandal, dealing with an electrical engineering quiz.  And it implicated initially several hundred students.  A smaller number were found to be guilty, but it was a sizable number that actually caused the institution to have a special commission established to look at the system and how that all worked.  It was led by Frank Borman, astronaut.  They called it the Borman Commission, actually.  So I can recall vividly as a freshman, freshman had to come outside and stand in their spot in formation before everybody else.  And I can recall going out and standing in my spot in formation--where I would stand, and there'd just be a few freshman standing around.  And I could see out of the corner, as I'm standing at attention, out of the corners of my eyes, there are officers all over the place, commissioned offers.  And I was, in my heart I was going like, oh, my gosh, we're gonna have the most incredible, unannounced inspection.  This is gonna be terrible, you know, but, you know, whether you didn't shine your shoes or something.  And what happened was, everybody came out, got in ranks.  They took attendance, everybody gave a report of where they were for, you know, who was present.  And then after they gave that, these officers descended down on each of the companies.  In my case, there was a battalion of three companies in this area where we lived.  And they just started walking up and pulling people out of formation.  Would you come with me, please?  Would you come with me, please?  Didn't say why.  They just pulled them aside.  They were all juniors, so we knew something was going on.  This is the Class of '77 [1977].  They took all and locked 'em up in the Earth, Space and Graphic Science auditorium 'cause there was that many of 'em.  And then they told 'em that they were all being, you know, that it had been alleged that they'd all violated or cheated on an electrical engineering take-home quiz.  The rest of us had no clue what was going on that day until at lunch time, there was an announcement in the mess hall, which basically said, everybody was gonna have to report to, I think it was a major ballroom, a major auditorium.  And it was at, in that auditorium where we were all told, you know, hey, there's been a major honor, you know, there's a major honor investigation going on.  It involves a large number of people, blah, blah, blah.
Story_ID: 36371
Speaker 1: So, so that, and so the result of that was, at the end of that year [at the United States Military Academy at West Point]--before we didn't, at that time when I was there, we didn't do what they call "scrambled."  You entered in as a freshman, and you graduated as a senior in the same company, with that same group of people, you know, freshman, sophomore, senior, junior year.  Because of that honor scandal, they decided they were going to, the senior class graduated.  So they were gone.  The junior class and the sophomore class--this is at the end of my freshman year, they scrambled them.  They mixed them up and put 'em in different companies random all over the regiment.  So those who were implicated, but maybe found innocent wouldn't have any taint on them, tainted view of them, you know, because they were found innocent.  And, and it sort of gave everybody a fresh start.  Well, it also gave me a fresh start, okay.  I wasn't obviously involved in that, but it gave me a fresh start because all these people who would normally be the same group of people who my peers and the people right above me would have said, this guy's a dirt bag like he was last year, you know, they're now all scrambled and gone.  There's a whole new group now in my company.  And, you know, it says, some divine providence that that happened.  And, I got a brand new tactical officer, who happened to come in and be assigned.  And this is the guy that looked at my freshman ratings and my summer ratings at the end of my freshman year, I mean at the beginning of my sophomore year, and said, wow, I can't believe this is the same guy.  And that year, I absolutely excelled as a cadet.  And so my tact, his name was Peter J. Ammons, Captain, was missing a leg, had his leg blown off in Vietnam, so still serving at that time.  He was intrigued with my turnaround.  And he was very encouraging of me.  I also had got through my freshman courses, and I started focusing on now, you actually had to go through as a freshman some remedial training in math because I spent all my time talking to my football coach in high school instead of focusing on the hard rigor of the kinds of things I needed to be prepared.  I was naturally good at it.  I just didn't know I was good at it.  And then I actually end up majoring in engineering, you know.  My focus, my area of concentration was mechanical engineering.  So I went through my sophomore year.  I got, continued to get more involved in church-related activities.  I was still getting spiritually grown and, through the mentorship of Chaplin Dick [Richard] Camp.  I got a fresh start in life with Peter J. Ammons in terms of being a tact who's looking at my old and new and saying, okay, hey, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt.  I'm taking what he's doing now.  And I had a whole new, fresh set of people who were looking at me because, and that--therefore, I could get a fresh start, objective look at me from all peers.  I ended up toward the, I excelled in physical things and as well as school.
Story_ID: 36372
Speaker 1: In the, towards the end of the year [at the United States Military Academy at West Point], you have to choose what you're gonna do at the end of your sophomore year for training.  And we were, at that time--they don't do it anymore, but they used to send about fifty cadets a year to Ranger School.  That's our hardest military school.  You know, and they would give one slot per company, and then one for each battalion.  And that equal about fifty.  Okay, so it was thirty-six companies, and then one for each battalion, it's like 12, 12 battalions.  So, you know, you'd have about fifty students.  And I went to Peter J. Ammons and said, I wanna go to [United States Army] Ranger School.  And that's normally you're, you know, you're picking one of your best people to do that because it's so challenging.  And then I heard rumor--and he says, well, I'm gonna put you in for that.  And then I heard rumor that there was a cadet who was not in my organization, but that he was gonna give up his vacation and that he was gonna try to do [U.S. Army] Airborne School which is three more weeks.  Ranger School's like eight, nine weeks, you know.  Airborne School's three weeks, so this guy was gonna give up his summer vacation--normally, you'd go to Ranger School.  If you made it, you'd finish.  You'd have like three weeks to recover, and then go back to school.  Or you'd get three weeks to recover, to have vacation in the front, and then go to Ranger School your last eight to nine weeks, and then come back to school as a junior.  In my case, I said, I'm willing to go to Ranger School and the day I graduate from Ranger School, I wanna go to Jump [Airborne] School and give up my vacation and come back to school 'cause I heard another cadet was doing it.  It wasn't even true, the rumor.  But he said, are you sure you wanna do that?  This guy believed in me.  I go, yeah, I do wanna do that.  He went to my regimental tactical officer, Colonel Bob Day, and Day said, okay, we're gonna give him the shot and let him do it.  And so, and the summer of 1977, I left the day after I finished my last final exam.  I flew, got on a bus, went out to catch a plane with a bunch of, about, you know, twenty-five other guys who were going through their very first segment of Ranger School, went to Ranger School, went all the way--straight through it, had all kind of, I had several big things happen to me that were good.  When I was in Ranger School, they have a competition called the "King of the Pits".  They do hand-to-hand combat, and they put every, they start the whole class, one against each other.  And they keep whittling it down till there's one left.  And I was the King of the Pits, you know, for my Ranger Class 1-77.  And I won our Land Nav [Navigation?] course.  I was first in our Land Nav course.  So I mean it, so, so, you know, this field craft stuff was just naturally, it, you know, I took to that.  I graduated from Ranger School at ten o'clock.  And at one o'clock, I was signing into Airborne School, same day.  And then when I went to Airborne School--Ranger School was incredibly hard, you know.  And I didn't have the, I'll call it the soldier hardness 'cause I'm a student at West Point, right, of hardened feet and things like that, like a good soldier would have that's been training for years to go to Ranger School.  So I had some, those things were more challenging.  But I was fit and determined and, you know, focused.  And so I gutted through that, had no problem getting through there.  Then I went to Jump School the same day, and what I remember about going through Jump School, although my body was kind of wracked a little bit from going through Ranger School, when I had that Ranger tab on my shoulder, I was in, I felt invincible.  And so I would invite, I would invite torment from the Airborne instructors.  And it was all in good fun, but, you know, they would, they'd have--when everybody else was doing side straddle hop, jumping jacks, to a slow cadence, they'd make me do 'em as fast I could do 'em.  And I would be up on the tower and they'd make you yell out something that you would have to say, like, you know, "Four jumpers, right door."  I'd yell out, "Four jumpers, right door, Rangers lead the way."  And then they'd say, okay, Ranger, leg. get down here.  I'm gonna show you who leads the way.  And they'd mess with me, but it was fun.  I actually enjoyed this.  This is going from a freshman where I just hated that kind of stuff to now, I'm actually having fun with it.
Story_ID: 36373
Speaker 1: Graduated from Jump School [U.S. Army Airborne School]--
Speaker 2: So these are like boot camps, basically, both of 'em [U.S. Army Ranger School and Airborne (Jump) School] are--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --really tough boot camps.
Speaker 1: Hard, right, hard.  And--
Speaker 2: So to point that out, so, I mean you're getting up like, how early in the morning--
Speaker 1: Well, when you're in Ranger School, it's like you're living out in the woods continuously for almost nine weeks.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, so it's not like a, I mean in the very first phase of it, there's a city phase, where you're doing all kinds of personal skill, you know, assessment skills and things like that, right, that's in your early morning, four or five o'clock in the morning runs, you know, in combat boots, going through obstacle courses.  They got something called the worm pit which is a water-filled mud pit with barbed wire over the top, and you're crawling under that.  You know, there's all kinds of special skills like, you know, like shooting and combatives that I told you about and land navigation, a lot of that kind of stuff.  And then they take you up into the mountains, and you stay there for a couple of weeks, and you're patrolling, and you're walking miles and miles and miles.
Speaker 2: Now, you're in the mountains of where?
Speaker 1: Dahlonega, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And, and, you know, and they don't give you a lot, right, so they're starving you a little bit.  You don't get a lot of food, you know.  And they're doing that to really, intentionally, they're depriving you of sleep, and they're depriving you of food so that you are physically worn down because that's the closest thing they can sort of do to kind of give you the replication of the strain of what combat would be like.  And can you make decisions?  Can you fight through the pain?  Can you fight through the tiredness?  Can you focus to get a mission done under those--with that kind of stress, which is, replicates the stress of combat.  And that's why they do it like that.  And so you're hungry, you're tired, you know, you're delirious and you're trying to focus and make solid decisions.  Well, I mean, so it's intentional.  So you go through--finished that, and then started Jump School.  Jump School's different.  They're not trying to deprive you of food or anything because they don't want you to make a mistake and, you know, parachute accident.  But, but still, you're in the August heat of Columbus, Georgia, Fort Benning.  For me that wasn't bad 'cause I'd been down there for nine weeks already.  So I was already acclimatized.  You're still doing a lot of physical tasks, running, things of that nature.  And you have to be very exacting in terms of, you know, the skills that's required to learn how to be a paratrooper, how to land and all that kind of stuff.  I graduated from that 3 August.  My parents [Naomi Lewis Brooks and Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] came down for that.  They didn't come to my Ranger graduation.  They just figured we'll just come at the end when you graduate from everything.  So they came down to watch me graduate from Jump School, made five jumps in Jump School and then got back on a plane.
Story_ID: 36374
Speaker 1: Flew back to West Point [United States Military Academy], started class the next day [after graduating from the U.S. Army Airborne School].  So I lost--I wouldn't say lost, but I had zero summer between my sophomore and junior year.  Now, when I show up at West Point as a new junior, right, I am one of three, maybe, cadets in the entire academy that are Airborne and Ranger qualified 'cause one other person did what I did.  And then there was one guy that was prior service who had actually been in the Army, prior service, had a Ranger tab, was Airborne 'cause he was in a Ranger unit before he went to the Academy.  And, you know, so now you're this, you're even this, I'll call it, "super rare"--from a military perspective, okay, person.  And I fed on that.  I wanted to be even more, you know, strict, not strict, more tough, more, more focused, more into the military.  I was very much into the military.  In sports, remember I was an athlete.  So my sophomore year, I had every intention, I was gonna go back to football.  And when I, at the end of my freshman year, I was on the track team.  We were running one day.  And we ran by a rugby field.  And the coach I had at the time was named John Delamere (ph.), and he was an Olympian from New Zealand who was actually in the U.S. Army.  And he was assigned at West Point as a coach for our track team, for the jumpers.  And I was a triple jumper.  By the way, the sprint coach, who trained me in sprint, spring coach, was Mel Pender, Olympic Gold Medalist--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --who was the assistant head coach and ended up taking over as the head coach because our head coach, Coach Crowell (ph.), actually had a heart attack and died in my freshman year.  So, so I had Mel Pender, Olympic Gold Medalist, as my sprint coach.  I have John Delemere, New Zealand Olympian and these guys were in Munich [Germany; Olympics], and Mel Pender was in Mexico [Olympics] too.  Mel Pender, a gold medalist, I have this guy and then, and on top of him, we had a guy named Tom Hill.  He was the high hurdle coach.  Tom Hill was a Silver Medalist in Munich.  So these were my three--these were my coaches (laughter) in track, you know, when I was there.  So, me, you know, I became a much better athlete as a result of being with that kind of caliber of coach too, which is, by the way, you know, you think about West Point, you know, Bobby Knight was a basketball coach there.  Vince Lombardi was a football coach there.  Coach Mike Krashefski (ph.) who was the basketball coach there.  Matter of fact, Coach Krashefski was a coach--I have another story about that with my brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker], how my brother got in the Academy, you know, related to me, related to that.  (Simultaneous)
Story_ID: 36375
Speaker 1: Incidentally, now, did you notice your brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker] was there [United States Military Academy at West Point]?  I mean with all this going on in your sophomore year (laughter), I mean--
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: --your brother came in as a freshman, right?
Speaker 2: Well, okay, so he came in as a freshman.  So I went over and messed with a little bit when he was a freshman.  So, you know, and I would kind of look out after him.  I'd go check on him and stuff like that.  But he was having his own little personal experience.  The way that we were just coincidentally were assigned, I was in the first regiment--there are four regiments.  So it's, on one side of the campus.  He was in the fourth regiment on the very far end of the campus.  So I was in I-1.  He as in I-4, okay.  So, but then when I--remember I told you about the, we started scrambling people.  So then when I became a junior, they decided that was a good practice.  So then I got scrambled.  So I left that company.  I went to Company G-4.  So my brother and I were now assigned in the same battalion.  So I see him all the time.  Before we, you know, we went, different class schedules, went, you know, came in the mess hall at different times, went to different wings of the mess hall.  Now, we're in the same battalion.  I used to see him, and our barracks were right around the corner from each other.  So as a junior, and he's a sophomore now.  He can look around (laughter), you know.  I used to see him quite a bit when I moved over to G-4, when my whole class scrambled, and I end up going to G, yeah, Company G-4.
Story_ID: 36376
Speaker 1: And so, anyway, we were running track--again, I'm a sophomore [at the United States Military Academy at West Point].  It's in the fall, and we stopped, my New Zealand coach says, hey, let's stop and look at this.  And it was a rugby match.  I'm, at this time, I'm probably 175 pounds [weight], 175, 180 pounds.  I'm very muscular at that time.  Remember I had started out as, when I entered West Point, I was 165 [pounds], and I was, you know, so I was growing up a little bit.  And so when I was there, and looked at that, and those guys knew that I was a recruited athlete for football, the rugby players, and they knew I was a--I'm a track athlete--I am a varsity track athlete, next thing you know, they started--and they saw me interested in the game, they started doing some covert operations, coming up, hey, you know, you'd be really good at this, you know.  And I was enamored with the game.  I missed the contact of football that I didn't get in track, and I missed the camaraderie, the teamwork of football that I didn't get in track.  And so I then, the spring season of my sophomore year, that's when the main--they had two seasons, fall and spring, but the spring season's the big season that counts, I joined the rugby team.  And I've been playing rugby ever since (laughter), you know.
Speaker 2: So you still, are you still playing?
Speaker 1: Every once in a while, playing like the alumni game, like I'm not on the team right now, but like every year, like when I was a commandant at West Point, I played against all the seniors, which was an interesting experience (laughter).  But, you know, so I'll play like in the alumni game against the old, the "Old Gray," they call it.  That's the alumni team, against like the seniors and stuff like that.  Every once in a while, I'll play.  I love the game, but so, I had that experience.
Story_ID: 36377
Speaker 1: So now, I'm a junior [at the United States Military Academy at West Point].  So now, I'm thriving in, academically, I was doing well 'cause I'm taking courses that are in my--I'm not just taking general courses.  I'm taking courses that I like and I'm taking 'em in engineering disciplines.  And it really suited me well, thermodynamics, mechanical, you know, vibrations, aerodynamics, all those things, I really--fluid dynamics, I really liked that kind of stuff.  And I was doing well.  So I was doing well academically.  I'm doing really well militarily.  I was having a great time sports wise with my rugby team.  I was thriving on the rugby team.  I was a wing, I was a left wing on the varsity rugby team, and I just, you know, things were just really going good for me as a junior.  That's when I really kind of blossomed.  I started now becoming a leader like in the Sunday School, okay, of--and this was a Sunday School to teach children of the faculty.  This was not me going to Sunday School.  I was still doing individual bible study with Chaplin Dick Camp, you know.  So, man, I was really kind of in a zone there when I was a junior.  Light bulbs were all on when I was a junior.  Next thing you know, when I became a senior, I was selected--well, the, in the summer between my junior and senior year, they gave me a senior leadership position.  I did real well at that leadership position.  It was out in a field environment, this place I told you, the Camp Buckner, the place where you go, where I went after my freshman year to the summer training.  And I was the Number Two person for the whole regiment out there.  And they were impressed with me enough that I was elevated from that level to one of the most senior cadets.  I was a regimental commander.  At that time, that's the highest that any African American had ever served at the Academy.  There had been a couple others who had done it, but no one had ever been--the only thing higher than that is the regiment--is the brigade commander.  So I was a permanent six-stripe captain.  And there are seven of those at West Point, and I was one of them, okay.
Story_ID: 36378
Speaker 1: And, so, and then led my senior year, and I did follow my heart and became--chose infantry as my assignment, tried to get to the, went to the 101st Airborne Division as my first unit, duty unit.
Speaker 2: This was after graduation [from the United States Military Academy at West Point]?
Speaker 1: This is after graduation.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, is there anything significant about graduation that you--
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, so I'd be remiss if I didn't mention there was a couple of other people that were really important.  So in my, beginning of my senior year--no, in my junior year, I had a classmate in my company who, you know, everybody gets assigned a sponsor, right.  And the sponsor is somebody who, it's like a family place where you can kind of go and relax and have a home kind of experience, you know, while you're at the Academy.  And this friend of mine had a sponsor who's, who died of leukemia but his wife and their five children were still living on the installation 'cause he had just died.  He was a colonel.  And this guy took, he said these people just love people.  So he took me and about four or five other of my classmates over there just to be with that family, just to be around because they liked cadets.  And that ended up becoming a, the--that woman, the widow ended up becoming like a lifetime, like surrogate mother to me.  Her name is Bobby Pollock and she has mentored more cadets (laughter), mothered more cadets than anybody I know of.  And, you know, and still lives right outside the gate of West Point now.  So, but I, so when I--the thing I remember most about graduating was, is I was so, that was such a significant accomplishment, and I'd worked so hard to accomplish that, that when they said, "class dismissed," that's the thing I remember.  I turned and saw one of my best friends who was another guy who was with Ms. Pollock, one of the Pollock crew, and we, we looked at each other and had tears in our eyes and just had this incredible embrace--his name was Lloyd Darlington and the--African American graduate too--and just, you know, felt, I just couldn't believe how overwhelmed I felt and how proud I was to have done that and accomplished it.  That's the thing I remember most about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was an incredible day.
Speaker 2: All right, so this is in 1979?  That's in--
Speaker 1: That was June 6, 1979.
Story_ID: 36379
Speaker 1: All right, so the [U.S.] Army, after the Vietnam War, the Vietnam War closes in '73 [1973]--
Speaker 2: '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: '75 [1975], really.  Okay, all right, and so many people watched on television as American troops left Saigon [Vietnam].  A lot of people felt, oh, we were over there a long time, but not a lot got done, you know.  The Army starts regrouping--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And there's, in '73 [1973], the Army becomes all, a volunteer force.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And no more draft.  Also, a total force policy is adopted by the chief of staff, you know.  So were these, all these changes, like I suppose were discussed at West Point [United States Military Academy], right?
Speaker 2: Yep, pretty much, yes.
Speaker 1: And what was--well, tell us about the direction of the Army as you were (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: As I was entering, so, boy, do I have some strong feelings about that.  I worry that we're heading to some of the things now that we had then.  So when I entered the Army, we were drawing down significantly.  We under--our units were all under strength.  I'm in one of the most ready units in the Army, the 101st Airborne Division, I'm supposed to have forty-four men.  I probably had eighteen.  We're supposed to have a complement of five officers, a company commander, an executive officer and three rifle platoon leaders.  We had three officers, total in our company.  I'm supposed to have, I was supposed to have squad leaders that were staff sergeants that had experience that would probably be, you know, eight, nine years experience.  Some of 'em I had were Sergeant E-5s that might have had four years experience.  We had problems with drugs in the barracks.  We actually had to carry weapons, okay, to, when we, when, as staff duty officers at night, to patrol our barracks.  We had to carry a weapon.  And--
Speaker 1: That was, that's new.  That's what you're saying.  This is something new.
Speaker 2: That's 1979.  Well, I mean it was happening in the mid-'70s [1970s] too.
Speaker 1: It wasn't--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Well, okay, but I mean it wasn't regular procedure for that--
Speaker 2: During that time period, during the '70s [1970s], yeah, we had racial unrest.  You had a lot of drug issues.  You had--remember now, these are people who, you had a lot of people who were, some were not motivated to stay.  They were using the Army just as a means of, you know, having a paycheck.  The Army was not motivated to get rid of people that couldn't meet the standard 'cause they were trying to keep, because they were already short.  So when you only got eighteen people in your unit, and somebody's not doing something, you might let 'em slide with something that by 1984, '85 [1985], you would have got rid of 'em in a heartbeat.  Back then you wouldn't have.  You would have kept them.  It'd be harder to get rid of somebody that wasn't meeting the standard.  I busted a guy with a marijuana joint sticking out of his pants leg standing in formation, in uniform.  I could see it sticking out of his boot, walked up behind him, and what, "What you got in your boot?" you know, and pulled it out.  It was a joint.  I mean there was a big problem with drugs.  There was a problem with thievery.  There was a problem with AWOL [Absence Without Leave].  In fact, in--they created, it was around that time, as I recall, that if you had 101 AWOL, as in the 101st Airborne, if you had 101 AWOL-free days, you got a four-day pass for your unit.  And so, you know, they were trying to do things to even, just incentivize people to, you know, not leave work and skip work by giving them, you know, a pass.  So training.  We didn't have ammunition we needed.  You know, we--if I were to go out for a platoon live-fire, I might have, you know, two magazines, you know, sixty rounds of ammunition wherein in say, 1986, '85 [1985] time period, I might have seven, eight.  I mean, you know, I would be equipped with the ammo I would need.  We did not have fuel for our vehicles to take 'em all out and use 'em like we would want to.  I can recall people using golf carts to simulate armored vehicles to save gas, just so they could practice moving in formation and not use the big armored vehicles.  It was, it was not a good time.  And a lot of people left.
Story_ID: 36380
Speaker 1: And then thankfully, there was a core group of really solid leaders that had a lot of combat experience.  My very first battalion commander was a guy named David Brambling, David C. Brambling.  He was a wonderful man, a wonderful leader.  He was smart, he was articulate.  He was gifted.  He was combat experienced, ended up being a four-star general, four-star commander before he retired.  And David Brambling, or David A. Brambling, I guess it is, but Dave Brambling, you know, he--despite all those things, you know, he kind of focused on training or how to train, how to train right.  So that was a, I learned the power of leadership.  At the same time, I saw how bad it could be in terms of how, yeah, how bad it could be in terms of readiness 'cause we weren't ready.  And consequently, it was during that kind of time period when you had Miquez (ph.).  That's when you had Desert I, all those kind of things were kind of happening in that late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s] time period, right.
Speaker 2: Well, that fall, the Iran hostage situation.
Speaker 1: That's Desert I, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, you know.  And these were supposed to be "the" most trained, right, with night vision use, interoperability between units, you know.  All of those things were challenges.  Then we had Grenada right after that.  And in Grenada, we had where we couldn't--communications were a problem between the Navy Seals and between the ground forces.  There were problems in terms of conducting the airborne operation in terms of trying to get all the planes over the drop zone.  There were challenges between the 82nd and the Ranger Regiment in terms of coordinating on the ground.  There was problems in terms of sharing intelligence, all kinds of problems.  So that's '83 [1983], October '83 [1983].  And so it was sort of like after that, I think, everybody said, okay, I mean well, the president, enough is enough.  And they really kind of turned around and put money, resources, incentivized having quality leadership and, you know, and not only in the Officer Corps, in the NCO Corps too.  And that's sort of like when the big turnaround started.
Story_ID: 36381
Speaker 1: For me, I started out, I was a platoon leader in Bravo Company [B Company], 1st [Battalion] of the 503rd [Infantry].  That was my very first assignment.  My platoon sergeant, Gary Phillips, I'll never forget him because here's a guy, I was worried to death.  This guy in my case was a Sergeant First Class, Vietnam veteran, hardened later, but he, I almost, in some regards, he was like Sergeant Bilco.  He had so much stuff going on behind the scenes or whatever.  He could get anything, he could anything.  Everybody knew him, and he had actually been serving as the platoon leader because they didn't have one for like seven months when I showed up.  So I was concerned that he wouldn't wanna give up that authority.  But in true, noncommissioned officer [NCO] fashion, I remember standing in my formation for the very first time.  He's in front of the formation.  I'm behind it, and he says to the troops, he says--I can still hear it.  He basically said, all right, Second Platoon, you see we've got a lieutenant back there.  He says, he's harder than woodpecker lips.  Thank God we finally got one.  I'm tired of being an officer.  I'm ready to get back to being a platoon sergeant, doing my job.  But we're gonna take care of him and support him, you know, 'cause he's our lieutenant.  That kind of informal, but very important, transfer of authority, that NCO giving that to me in that way was so awesome and it wouldn't have worked any other way.  The guy taught me a lot.  He taught me a lot, you know, about fighting, you know.  I mean he had had the experience.  He helped me reason through how to deal with disciplinary issues that we might have in our platoon.
Story_ID: 36382
Speaker 1: For instance, can you give us an example of a discipline issue and how you would deal with it?
Speaker 2: Okay, so, for example, if I had a, you know, there was no physical abuse or anything of that nature, but let's say somebody came late to formation because they overslept or something, okay.  When you're young, and you don't know any better, your first inclination is, Article XV.  I'm gonna write 'em up.  I'm gonna punish 'em.  But a more reasoned person might say, okay, well, I got all the other, I got a whole lot of other tools I can use that just, doing nontraditional punishment, taking the guy's, busting him in rank.  I could have him do remedial training.  I could have him, you're gonna--okay, since you did that, you're gonna come do this.  You're gonna do this duty we need done in the day room, you know.  You're gonna clean the floors in the day room because it needs to be done by every--instead of having the whole platoon doing it on the weekend, you're gonna do it, you know, or something like that, you know, looking for alternative ways in terms of remedial training as opposed to just punishment.  And trying to find some things maybe that would be commensurate with whatever the offense was in terms of what you were gonna do in terms of remediation of that individual.  And not always reverting to yelling at somebody, like something you see in the movies, but talking to 'em as an adult, treating 'em as an adult when you're talking to 'em, and making them realize why, what they did was not the standard.  And in the end, you got them thinking, yeah, I do deserve it as opposed to, you know, having a confrontation where both sides are putting up their shields and, you know, one's digging in and one's, you know, directing.  Now, certainly for anything more serious or that was serious, right, you had the Uniform Code of Military Justice to use as a tool.  But those are some examples of where you might do that.  You might do some other things.  Now, I'd encourage people to not always use litigious means to solve problems.  I mean, you know--
Speaker 1: So those punishments would not be entered into their record?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's not on their record.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is not on their record.  That's just something you're gonna do and take care of and boom, and all right, we're done with it.  Now, you do it again, maybe, you know, maybe I might write it up as a, in your counseling statement, so I have it for the record.  But that's not any official document.
Speaker 1: So did you find soldiers grateful for that kind of a--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sure, I'll tell you a story later about where I gave a cadet, when I was a commandant, a second chance in life, and then later on, I--years later, this guy came up to me, and says, you don't remember me, but you gave me a second chance in life.  And now, I'm here, serving in this role where, you know, I wouldn't be if you hadn't given me that chance.  But see, I didn't forget the lesson that Peter J. Ammons, when I was a, when I was finishing my freshman year, and I started my sophomore year, you know, about giving people a chance, about seeing--trying to look in their heart, looking in their soul and seeing, okay, is this person remorseful or is this guy just, you know, flim-flam man and, you know, he's gonna do it again tomorrow.  You know, so if I--that's a gut call.  You know, there's nothing that tells you the answer.  That's a gut call, how well do you read people?  I felt like I read people pretty good and could tell.  You know, I've made mistakes in those assessments, but not many.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so this is your first assignment, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you were where in this first assignment?
Speaker 2: I was what?
Speaker 1: Where were you assigned, I mean?
Speaker 2: Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Oh, Fort--okay, so I do--we do have it right, in Fort Campbell.
Speaker 2: 101st [Airborne Division].
Story_ID: 36383
Speaker 1: And then, you know, so as soon as I got there, the first thing they did to me, my unit was deployed.  They said, hey, we're gonna send you to [U.S. Army] Air Assault School.  Are you in shape?  I said, yeah, I can do it.  Went to Air Assault School.  I was the Distinguished Honor grad [graduate], so I--of that course.  So it helped me starting out because the very first thing my unit saw was, is that their lieutenant and in their battalion was named the Distinguished Honor graduate of this course, this Air Assault School course.  I, I had a really good assignment there.  I was thriving there.  I moved to another assignment where I was the, I had a specialty platoon, anti-tank platoon.  And from that experience, I got identified as a potential to be aide de camp, you know, to a General Officer.  And that guy's name was Claude T. Ivy, Claude Talton Ivy.  He was the Assistant Division Commander for Operations.  And so he hired me.  So for a year, then I got to serve under this general who was really good at training.  He was known as a trainer.  He was a really hard guy on people, but really good trainer.  And, and going with him, we would go--because he was responsible for training of the whole division, I would go around with him, kind of following him around, and I'd witness what was good training, what was bad training, what was in the realm of the possible, what was not.  You know, what was too standard, and what wasn't.  And I witnessed that for over a year, so when he left, I had several commanders that were saying, you know, hey, you've had all that wonderful experience, I'd like you to stay, come down here to my unit and I'll make you a company commander.  Now, a company commander is normally somebody that's a captain and has, you know, anywhere from five to, you know, eight years of service.  And at this point, I probably have three and a half.  And, but I mean I had chance to command a rifle company in the 101st Airborne Division, Air Assault.  So I said, I'd love to have that opportunity, and--
Speaker 2: So by assisting the general for that period of time, you actually deepened your knowledge of--
Speaker 1: Totally, I totally deepened my knowledge.  And I also had, you know, I was excelling in my battalion and was known in my brigade, but because I was now this guy's aide de camp, where I was a sponge and sucking up all this, knowledge--you know, information about what's good and what's bad about training, you know, my universe expanded from my battalion to the whole division.
Story_ID: 36384
Speaker 1: And then what it also did was it gave me, it happened, it gave me great exposure to other leaders in the division [101st Airborne Division], who then, some of whom sought me as somebody who might have some talent that would add to their unit.  And so then, some asked me, hey, I want you to come command a rifle company I my brigade.  And so I went from the first, from the 3rd Brigade is where I started, 3rd Brigade, 101st.  When I came, left that aide [de camp to the Assistant Division Commander for Operations] job, I went to command a company in the 1st Brigade.  As a, I was still a lieutenant.  Something I'll never forget about that, at that time, there were about six black infantry company commanders in the division.  I mean I knew 'em all by name.  And--
Speaker 2: About how many in total?
Speaker 1: Oh, ghee, in a, well, let's see, a brigade's got eighteen.  There's like, you know, three maneuver brigades, each with eighteen, plus, let me is that right?  Yeah, something like that.  Then there's probably another, you know, fifteen or so in the Aviation Brigade, another 10, 15 in the Support Brigade, another, you know, then the separate battalions, there's some.  So, you know, you're talking, it's 150 company commanders, I'm guessing.  I'm, that's a swag.  But here's the thing I'll never forget about that.  So all those blacks that were commanding.  And while I served at the division headquarters working for that general, so I know there was no overt decision to do what I'm about to say, but it sure was beyond coincidence what I experienced.  And that is, you know, you have--in an infantry unit, you know, everything sort of circles around the rifle company, right.  That's the point of the spear, the rifle company.  The rifle company is augmented by either the combat support company that provides like anti-armor weapons capability.  But they normally detach their stuff out to support the rifle company.  And then there's headquarters companies.  That basically is admin, service support for a maneuver unit.  And it might have some specialty units in it like, you know, logistics platoon or transportation platoon.  Well, like three of the brigade-level--there's three infantry brigades.  Two of those infantry brigades had black company commanders.  The HHC Company, the headquarters company, the service company, the guy that's just responsible for making sure, you know, you got right supplies and you got the tents set up right, right.  And I'm diminishing the assignment because they're all important.  But they weren't putting these guys at the point of the spear.  They were putting 'em in the service support, one level back position.  Two of 'em had the Delta Companies.  One of 'em had a battalion HHC.  There was only one other guy, besides me, that had a rifle company, at the time, you know, at the time I was there.  There was one other, a guy named Arnold [Gordon-] Bray [also a HistoryMaker], who ended up being a general, okay.  So, guys were just not getting the opportunity to get in these rifle companies.  They were all going to these service support organizations.  And so, you know, people promoting their own image, and so what ends up sort of happening is, is they start looking at their top guys or whatever, they're tending to be your rifle company guys, in a light unit, right, in an airborne kind of unit.  Nobody wanted to really do the headquarters thing.  So that was very interesting.  And I noted that.  I had a wonderful assignment as a rifle company commander.  It went beautifully.  I was like one of the youngest ones in the entire division because I, I was in command probably a year as a lieutenant, maybe six, eight months as a lieutenant.  And then maybe ten months as a captain, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I hadn't even been to Advance Course which is the training you normally go through before you--
Speaker 2: Become a captain?
Speaker 1: --become a company commander.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 36385
Speaker 1: So I came out of the 101st [Airborne Divison].  I ended up being there like four and a half year.  I commanded there for eighteen months.  I found that I had no problem leading troops.  I had a really good unit.  I got ranked very highly as a company commander.  And so when I was towards the end, and they said, well, what do you wanna do?  You ought to think about going to be a professor at West Point [United States Military Academy], you know.  You could go do this, that and the other thing.  I said, I wanna go to a ranger battalion.  Grenada had just happened 'cause that was October '83 [1983].  This was like, you know, I left there in like, probably summer of '84 [1984], no January '84 [1984], I mean like three or four months afterwards, Grenada.  And so I went to, I applied to do that.  And I can vividly remember one of my battalion commanders, former battalion commander, saying to me, Leo, don't do it.  I go why would you say that?  He goes, okay, I'm just gonna be candid with you.  And he was trying to be helpful.  He says, you have gotten excellent efficiency reports as a rifle company commander.  You're gonna go, try to go to a ranger battalion, where it's all white, virtually, okay, where you unknown, and you're gonna--and if you stumble, then it's gonna be a risk.  They're gonna say maybe you didn't do well, and then over here we said you do well, so, you know, you're, you know, you're not--there's no definitive.  You're this thumbs-up guy we're saying right now.  Why would you take that risk?  I can still remember that guy saying that to me.  And I remember saying to him, I said, well, sir, I'm an infantryman.  And the rangers are supposed to be the best infantry in the world.  Why wouldn't I want to not--why wouldn't I wanna be part of something that's the best there is?  That's what I wanna do.  So anyway, I applied.  I put in a packet.  I got great endorsements to go.  And I was selected to go.  And I went to the, I had to go literally to this Advance Course that I should have gone to before I could even command a company.  I went there, and--at Fort Benning, Georgia, to the Infantry Officer Advance Course.  And interestingly enough because I delayed a year, because I was in command, you know, normally I would have gone a year before.  But I delayed leaving to go because I was commanding a rifle company when I normally wouldn't be doing it.  So it caused me to go a year late to the Advance--later than my peers were going.  And so my brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker], who is now an infantryman, goes when he's supposed to go to the Advanced Course.  We're in the exact same course.  We live in government quarters, and we are assigned quarters on the exact same cul du sac.  We live four doors away from each other, you know.  I'm getting ready to go to ranger battalion.  He hasn't gone to, he's coming out of the 82nd Airborne Division.  And he's getting ready to go to Europe to command a company, his first company in Europe.  I can remember my parents [Naomi Lewis Brooks and Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] coming to visit us.  And so, you know, I'm living here, he's living right down the street from me.  And, you know, my parents learning, okay, so how do we deal with that?  We got two sons.  They've both got families, blah, blah, blah.  So my parents came, they stayed at my house for two days, packed their suitcase, walked down the street, three doors, four doors, and they stayed with him for two days.  So I mean that's the kind of thing that--it was just, but it was a really cool time to share, you know, be in something with your brother.
Story_ID: 36386
Speaker 1: I graduated from that course, that Advanced Course [Infantry Officer Advance Course], and because I'm going to a ranger battalion, I immediately was lucky enough to get a slot into the [U.S.] Army's Jumpmaster program.  So, to me, if [U.S. Army] Ranger School is the most physical course I ever been through in my life, Jumpmaster [School] is, by far, the most difficult mentally.  It's zero defects, okay, in terms of procedure, where your hands are, nomenclature, 'cause you're affecting people's lives, how you actually check somebody to parachute out of a plane, very exact.  I did that before I went down to ranger battalion.  And I was very blessed that, you know, I was the Distinguished Honor graduate of that course before I showed up.  So I showed up in that unit with that, having done that, which kind of put me in a good place starting out.  When I arrived, I was the only black officer in the ranger regiment when I arrived.  There had been a couple--one or two before, at different times.  But when I was there, initially, I was the only one in the whole regiment.  I had great, I mean when I first got there, I had an awesome battalion commander, a guy named Wesley B. Taylor.  And I, you know, that guy was just as level as they come.  I really learned when I was in the rangers about what you can do when you're given top-quality people and basically unlimited resources.  The stuff we were doing, I mean I just couldn't believe the level of proficiency that these people had.  And the confidence that they had in their ability, and to be a part of that, it was the most proud thing I, you could ever imagine, you know.  I mean these guys, if you need to go through a wall, that's who you want, you know.  I mean they were unstoppable.  They were relentless.  They're hard, and it was great to be a part of that.  I, it took a while for me to break in to sort of the, get accepted.  I started out on the staff.  And after about two years of waiting on the staff, serving on the staff, doing a good job on the staff, I got the opportunity to command a Ranger Rifle Company.  So, you know, point of the spear in the most tough thing that we have, you know.  And I took command of Alpha 175 in about July of--June or July of, it would have been probably 1986.  And just had some incredible experiences there too.
Story_ID: 36387
Speaker 1: So I started out as a Ranger company commander in 2000--in 1986 and, at Alpha Company, and had something really tragic happen very early in my command.  We were actually doing a rehearsal, a real-world rehearsal for a real operation--rescue operation.  And part of that rehearsal involved using explosive charges.  And in an explosion that I actually had the, was talking on a radio and gave the command for the explosive device to be set off.  A piece of shrapnel from the explosion actually blew back, a bunch of it, right back where I was laying with my assault unit.  And I had, the radio that I gave the command to detonate this thing, was on the back of a young PFC [private first class] named Michael Ruddis (ph.).  And a piece of shrapnel hit Ruddis right here on his left side, right next to me.  And my shoulder was touching his shoulder literally, as we were laying next to each other and killed him, cut his aorta and killed him.  And on my immediate left side was another young man who had another piece of shrapnel hit him and tra--you know, traumatically amputated his hand, his right hand.  And so, and then there was a lieutenant that got hit in the head by a piece of shrapnel from that same explosion.  And the thing I'll never forget about that was, another one of my heroes is a guy by the name of Joe Stringum (ph.).  And Joe Stringum was the ranger regimental commander, fearless wartime hero from Vietnam.  He's not a commander of the range regiment.  So as this accident occurs, and again, this is a rehearsal for a real op, it was in Dugway, Utah and we're doing it.  I called in the Medivac [medical evacuation] to extract my wounded, and PFC Ruddis after we were treating him and the other soldier.  And the range regimental commander didn't see it, but he was in the general area.  So he came over to the location where I was.  I'll never forget this.  You know, we're still dealing with the tragic, tragedy of this, you know.  And I'd been, I hadn't experienced this kind of thing, per se, before.  And he looked right at me.  He goes, okay, Ranger, tell me, tell me what happened.  I told him where we were, what happened, what I thought happened 'cause this was three o'clock in the morning in the dark.  And he goes, okay, you got your wounded evacuated?  I said, yes, sir.  He goes do you have your sensitive items accounted for?  I says, yeah, we got all their stuff together.  And then he said to me, looked me in the face--he didn't do what some people would have done, which would, might have been, okay, well, let's stop.  Let's take a statement from everybody.  Let's, and I'm not saying we shouldn't pay attention to safety.  I'm just the opposite.  But this is an important thing.  He said to me, he goes, "Okay, Ranger.  You still got one hour and fifteen minutes to get to extraction."  He was telling me, you know, you don't get to quit just because that happened.  Move out.  Keep moving, continue the mission, Charlie-Mike.  I've never, ever forgotten that.  And that profoundly impacted me in the, several major decisions later in my life when I was sitting in his role in life.  But so, we did move, get our--move to a desert-lake bed.  We did get picked up on aircraft, and we did get out of there and did mourn our dead.  And I did get to, later to provide a, you know, go hand--it was a tragic thing.  I witnessed this guy die, and then I'm now handing a widow, his widow is nineteen [years old], you know, a flag.
Story_ID: 36388
Speaker 1: So this was the first casualty you've ever experienced in the [U.S.] Army, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm gonna call it casualty in a killed, while doing something in training; not like a, you know, I had people like, maybe got killed in a car wreck or something, but not like that.  I mean and that one was up close and personal.  You know, it was, we--this guy's right next to me.  This is my op--radio operator.  I spent nights in a hole with that guy.  The night before he got killed, we were in a old hide-hole with a little net over the top of us, you know, all night or all day rather.  I mean this, you know, so, yeah, that was hard.  But you know what it did?  So two things happened.  So after we did that, got back, I'd been back a week maybe, back in Savannah [Georgia] where my headquarters was.  And then I got alerted, and my company got a no-notice alert to fly to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and the mission was to do a live fire breach of a wired obstacle, basically, the exact same thing I had to do in Dugway, Utah.  It was get back on your horse, you know.  I mean I had no notice, alerted my company, boom, flew us up there, told us to--we had this mission to execute this raid.  And that another thing I'll never forget.  It was get back on your horse.  Of course, we did all the assessments and why did it happen and all that kind of stuff.  But it was get back on your horse.  We haven't lost confidence in you or your unit.  And I'm gonna tell you, as a result of that, as a result of that, that unit galvanized.  We were "the" experts in demo 'cause I know what, I understand, understood what it could do more than anybody 'cause I witnessed it in terms of what it does to a human.  We were "the" experts in demo.  We were "the" best rifle company.  We shot more, we fought harder.  We road marched [ph.] further.  We just galvanized.  It was incredible.  In fact, my company--I have a picture, right over here is a picture of me getting a big plaque from the Ranger Regimental Commander a year later as "the best" ranger company in the Ranger Regiment.  And so, you know, while that was tragic, there was something, the silver lining was learning from that experience and growing.  So I served there for longer than most officers do.  I was there for four years straight in that kind of unit and was just thriving.  And I was surprised when I left, when I was leaving there, they then wanted to go to--wanted me to do something short.
Story_ID: 36389
Speaker 1: They sent me to Korea, and I was like, you gotta be kidding man.  I've been basically unaccompanied for four years, and you wanna send me to Korea.  And they, ah, it'll be good for your career.  I said, I don't want (laughter), I don't wanna go to Korea by myself.  I got over there by myself, and then worked to find a way to get a command-sponsored job where I could bring my family over there.  And I ended up moving into a joint billet for the command and served there for three years actually.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, let me ask you at this point, now, how did you meet your wife?
Speaker 1: At Fort Campbell [Kentucky] when I was actually working for the, as the aide [-de-camp] to that General.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is early on in your, you know, '82 [1982]?
Speaker 1: It was about--
Speaker 2: --eighty--
Speaker 1: '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Right, 1981
Speaker 2: All right, so by 1989, I guess, here, how many children did you have?
Speaker 1: So I had one kid per my initial four duty assignments.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So my oldest daughter, Bethany, was born at Fort Campbell, my first assignment.  The next one was born when I was going through the Advanced Course in [U.S. Army] Jumpmaster School at Fort Benning [Georgia].  The next one was born when I was in the 75th Ranger Regiment in Savannah [Georgia], and the final one was born when I was in Korea.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 1: All girls.
Speaker 2: All right, okay.  So let's pick up then.  So you're in Korea at this point?
Speaker 1: Right, and so I had to, serving on the joint staff I got the opportunity one day, they said, we need somebody to brief.  And I'm, at this point, I'm a senior captain.  I'm still a captain, but, you know, I'm now wearing Master Parachuter's wings, I'm Pathfinder.  I'm Air Assault and Ranger, all these things.  So I look like a nice candidate to stick in front of the senior leadership to do briefings, command briefings.  And so I briefed the--one time they put me in front of the Commander in Chief of Korea, Lou Menitre (ph.).  And, you know, I think part of my West Point [United States Military Academy] training was, you know, you have to do a lot of mental recall, a lot of memorization, a lot of sight memory.  So I was able to really kind of look at a map and learn all, remember all kinds of details about what was happening, battle wise on that map.  And so I would be able to flow naturally in my speech to this guy.  And then he really liked the way I presented it, and the next thing you know, I become his command briefer for all, every day, his war updates while I was over there for two years.  Wonderful experience.  My first joint experience.  I made lifelong friends over there.  My, one of my best friends, from over there, a guy named Jay Paxton is now Assistant Commandant, [U.S.] Marine Corps, Marine four-star.  I was with him when he was, we were both majors at that time.  I got promoted while I was over there.  We were both majors together sitting over there.  We used to together, go patrol.  We would get in a helicopter and fly from one coast to the other coast, right along the demilitarized zone [DMZ] to check boundary warnings and markers and things.  That's the kind of stuff we used to do.  We were down together when the--they exploited, they found the North Korean tunnel that was dug under the DMZ.  They found that while I was there.  And we were together on a team that exploited that--not that went in it, but the planning for that.  So, really good friend, and now it's cool to see him as a four-star.  Another, since we're, doring African American history, you know, another person that was with me there, another Marine was a guy named Walt Gaskin, (ph.).  Walt Gaskin is a Marine three-star right now and another great professional who I met over there.  There was a really good group of people on that staff.  They were, I guess, I think part of--they were sending people over there to get joint qualified in a theater that was real, you know.  And there was a lot of good people that came out of there during that group.  We worked for a guy by the name of Colonel Marty Steele, ended up being a Marine three star.  The Plans, Policy and Operations leader of, for the Marine Corps.  And at the time, he was a colonel and just a tremendous--that was another guy.  I learned about how to be a staff officer from that guy.  It was just incredible in terms of what he expected and the kind of products we produced.
Story_ID: 36390
Speaker 1: I left there [Korea], went to the Command and General Staff College [CGSC] of Fort Leavenworth [Kansas] where I served for, you know, I was just basically going to school for a year.  And then I went to the 82nd Airborne Division, and, you know--
Speaker 2: Okay, so Fort Leavenworth is in--
Speaker 1: Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Speaker 2: Not, yeah, yeah, and that's in 1991, right?  Is that right?
Speaker 1: Let's see, '90 [1990], '91 [1991].
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: '90 [1990], '91 [1991] time period.
Speaker 2: All right, so now--
Speaker 1: Let's see, my daughter was born February, '90 [1990], and I think I would have left there June, June of '90 [1990] to June of '91 [1991] probably.
Speaker 2: Now, the, in terms of the national focus, people were focused on the Desert Storm in 1990.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Colin Powell came to the attention of many African Americans who didn't even know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who he was, you know.  But at that time, he's appointed head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, so did you play any role in Desert Storm?
Speaker 1: I was in Korea during that.
Speaker 2: Okay, right.
Speaker 1: And so when I got to the Command and General Staff College, it was loaded with people who had just come back from that 'cause that was a pretty quick event, you know.  So, yeah, because I was in that theater, I did not go.  I stayed in Korea during that time period.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but this was--
Speaker 1: You know, Colin Powell, my father [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] probably told you.  I mean he and Colin Powell were like contemporaries at the same time, kind of growing up, along with, under [Julius] Becton [also a HistoryMaker] (laughter).
Speaker 2: So did you know these, did you know Colin Powell at this point?  I mean had you--
Speaker 1: Not really.  I didn't.  My dad did.  I knew General Becton.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: For sure, you know, I knew him when I was a cadet.  And when I was a senior I remember going down there and he was either getting ready to take over the 1st Calv [Calvary] Division or maybe he had already or he'd just come out of it, one of the two.
Story_ID: 36391
Speaker 1: So you're in Command [and General Staff] College [CGSC] at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  Okay.  Well, tell us what happened?
Speaker 2: I mean that was just regular school year of education and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: And I got selected to go to the 82nd Airborne Division [Fort Bragg, North Carolina].  So I went there as a major.  I was, you know, I'm coming in with a ton of airborne experience from my four years in the Ranger Regiment.  But I had never done big, giant airborne operations.  Rangers do small things, you know, smaller sized things.  And I was the executive officer, Number Two of a battalion when I came in.  My brigade commander was David H. Petraeus, was my boss.  I--oh, I take that back, I take that back.  That was later.  It was a guy named Bob Harper.  And so when I, as soon as I got there, started immediately training to go, back then, the Multinational Force and Observers was a big mission.  This was the organization that sat between the Israeli's and the Egyptians in the Sinai Peninsula.  And so I deployed over there for six months as the second in command of that battalion.  I had a great experience doing that, being away, by yourself, with your unit, being in a senior leadership position of that organization, getting to tour the--as a Christian, getting to tour the Holy Land, and I had an opportunity to do that on mid-tour break and climb Mount, you know, Mount Sinai.  I mean that was pretty cool to do that kind of thing.  So I had that experience.  I came back from that experience to finish that year, and then I was picked up.  I did well in that assignment, and then so the division commander chose me to come up to be his Deputy G-3, so the deputy operations officer of the division.  And I went to do that.  I had a great experience under a guy named John Scroggins who was my brigade--my G-3.  I was the Deputy G-3; learned a lot about airborne operations at a grander scale, serving in that role, which then really helped me later in life.
Story_ID: 36392
Speaker 1: So while there [82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, North Carolina], one day I remember my one-star, over top of me, walked into my office.  And that's unusual, and he walked--I was a major.  He walked in and he goes, hey, do you have anything, you know, got any hidden things in your closet that would prevent you from doing a very sensitive position?  I go, no, sir.  I don't know what you're talking about.  And he goes, you're being considered for something very significant.  I can't tell you right now, but you're being considered for something very significant.  And he says, I just wanted to check.  Anyway, a couple of weeks go by, and the next thing you know, I'm getting, I get a call saying, you've been selected to interview, to be the aide [-de-camp] to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, Gordon R. Sullivan.  And I said, holy mackerel, I don't even know him.  I've never met him.  How did that happen?  I went up.  I interviewed.  He sat me down on a couch.  He talked to me for about twenty minutes.  I, he goes--and I didn't think I got it.  And he said, well, you know, he said, you know, if you get this job, you're gonna have a lot of people trying to get through you to me.  He said, you're gonna have to deal with a lot of senior people in that regard.  And I said, sir, I can handle that.  And I, our karma just kind of clicked, and then he goes, well, we'll be in touch with you.  So when he said it that, he didn't say, hey, you got the job.  And I figured, okay, well, I don't think I got it.  I went home.  About two days later I got this phone call saying, "Congratulations, can you be up here next week?" (Laughter)
Story_ID: 36393
Speaker 1: And within a week, they flew me back up there to go on a, like a seven-country trip [as the aide-de-camp of the chief of staff of the U.S. Army], swing with the old guy I was replacing so that I could--that's why they wanted me to come so fast, so I could see how to do the kinds of things I had to do in that role.  And there's probably nobody that has had a greater influence on me as a military professional than that man, Gordon R. Sullivan [former chief of staff of the U.S. Army].  My father [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] certainly has been a tremendous influence in terms of character and work ethic and things like that.  But this man had that, plus how to lead, how to lead, how to think strategically, how to, you know, use your position to get things done, but not be overbearing.  He was a masterful, brilliant man.  And I was with him for two years.  And I kind of got him in stride.  And so he was on his last two years as chief, so, you know, he knew exactly what he was doing, and I was witnessing all these things.  I kept a journal.  I mean I've been to every place you can think of, you know, from Mogadishu [Somalia] to Rwanda to, you name it, and anywhere there was a soldier.  And--
Speaker 2: Now, is '94 [1994] when they had the Rwandan crisis.
Speaker 1: I was there (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, so that was, I think that probably would have been, it probably would have been '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, I think it is.  I think you're--that was '94 [1994] and--
Speaker 1: I can remember landing at the--you know, again, I'm, you know, in my roots, I'm a paratrooper at heart.  So, and I'm a ranger.  So, you know, one of the Mecca locations for special operations is, events was the Entebbe raid by the Israelis in Entebbe, Uganda.
Speaker 2: Uganda, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so when we flew in there, we flew into that airport, and you could still see the 707 that the, that was hijacked, still sitting there in 1994 from whenever that was, which would have been probably fifteen years prior to that.  And you could still see bullet holes in the tower.  They had built a new part of the run--of the airport, but the old part of the airport still looked like it had just been hit.  And that was a very interesting experience to see that.
Speaker 2: So you were in Entebbe, you were in Rwanda.  You weren't there during the crisis, but afterwards to see--
Speaker 1: Well, no, we were there during the crisis (laughter).
Speaker 2: Entebbe, that's the--
Speaker 1: Oh, no, not during the--
Speaker 2: You saw the aftermath of that.
Speaker 1: Yes, correct.
Speaker 2: But you were there during the Rwandan crisis--
Speaker 1: Correct, correct.
Speaker 2: And Mogadishu, right?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Now, the Black Hawk Down incident took place, what, in 1993?  Is that right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, October, '93 [1993].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was, I think it was October.
Speaker 2: Right, right, so that was--
Speaker 1: I was there right after that, a little after that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Somalia basically didn't have a government really at--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, it didn't.  Matter of fact, it was very interesting to go, you know, we're all bunkered in where we were staying, and then when you go out, you know, fly in a helicopter to go look at the site where that happened, you know, and how you stand off, to make sure you're not, your helicopter doesn't get whacked, you know, it was pretty interesting.
Story_ID: 36394
Speaker 1: So was the U.S. Army there as a part of a U.N. peacekeeping force or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: There was a multinational force there, Pakistanis, French.  There was a bunch of countries that were in there.
Speaker 1: And that's still--
Speaker 2: And they had a U.S. commander.
Speaker 1: I think the country still basically doesn't have a government--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --even today.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right, you're right, very unstable, which is, unfortunately, because that's the kind of place becomes a safe haven for terrorists.
Speaker 1: Right, I know they still have pirate activity off the coast and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So, so you're getting a--once again, you're getting this mentorship and tour as a--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --aide-de-camp to someone who's doing a lot of different things--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you're able to shadow them.
Speaker 2: Right, Bosnia, everywhere, Bosnia, all, everywhere that there was something going on.  And, you know, and witnessed, some very historic kinds of things occurred too, fiftieth anniversary of D-Day.  You know, we--I went with him on a contingent over there, and we had, I witnessed, I got to meet men and women that were involved in that fight.  And, you know, Saint-Mere-Eglise, where paratroopers landed, Omaha Beach, you know, where the 29th came ashore on--I mean you're in all these places where, you know, history was made, to be there and because he's who he was, obviously, you have people walking him through what happened there in a deep--level of detail that you wouldn't normally get if you were just your average tourist.  We took with us a medal of honor winner, Walter Ailers (ph.), was part of our party, won the Congressional Medal of Honor.  And his brother was killed there on the beach, you know, to see--interact with this guy and for him to go up and touch the monument that has his brother's name on it, see his reaction, forty years, fifty years later--
Speaker 1: So you're there in '95 [1995], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1995.
Speaker 2: It was incredible.  President Clinton [President Bill Clinton] came over there and did--you know, all these heads of state from all these governments, all of them came, were there.  It was incredible.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you were with Gordon R. Sullivan through the end of '95 [1995] or--
Speaker 2: I was with him until June of '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36395
Speaker 1: And then I was selected to go command a battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division, and I went right back to the same battalion I was in when I was a major, same battalion, 1st of the 504, 1st Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the Red Devils.  And I commanded that battalion, I actually got there in October.  I commanded it from October of '95 [1995] to October of '97 [1997].
Speaker 2: Now, this is what you have said is your most wonderful experience as a commander, right?
Speaker 1: Well, my most wonderful experience was when I commanded the brigade.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, which is coming, so I commanded for two years there.  And just, I had a great experience there too.  I mean it's hard.  I mean my Ranger Company experience was phenomenal as a shaping experience for me.  I also loved being the aide [-de-camp] to the Chief of Staff of the Army [Gordon R. Sullivan], but from a command, leadership, interaction perspective, I'd say Ranger Company Command and, well, probably brigade commander in the 82nd, Ranger Company Command and then probably battalion command were the things that really, just were phenomenal.  And then probably being the commandant of West Point [United States Military Academy].  I can't throw that out.  And, and they're, but they're all different kinds of experiences.  When I was a battalion commander, I can recall, you know, having the experience of, you know, because one--the Airborne Battalion in Italy was in Bosnia, and then they thought they were gonna have to do a noncombatant evacuation operation out of another country, Burundi which is right below Rwanda 'cause all that violence was moving down there.  And I'd been there.  So I can remember one really freezing, cold January getting called to get all my officers or all my planning staff and flew to Italy, to plan to go do neo-operation Burundi.  I mean I had all kinds of good experiences like that when I was in, a battalion commander.  And when I was a battalion commander, that's when David Petraeus was my brigade commander for the vast majority of it, and then the last three or four months, I had a guy named Carl Horst who's a friend of mine.  So Petraeus was a great boss to have.  He really, that guy taught me how to, about training too.  He was a really good person for being innovative, very innovative leader, very focused in terms of having a PT physical culture.  And, you know, just I was always raised to make sure my units were ready to do what they were gonna be called to do in action, right?  So being physically fit, being well equipped and trained, being mentally straight so that they were clear in terms of what they had to do, having clear guidance and having the right resources to prepare themselves.  That's sort of like really the essence of what I was trying to do when I was in command.  And that, a lot of that kind of came from some of these other leaders, especially when I was in the Ranger Battalion, but also Petraeus was really good about that, in terms of teaching me that.
Story_ID: 36396
Speaker 1: Okay, so what do these statistics sound like?  We have some stats from 1996 that say that African Americans comprised about 21.9 percent of the total enlisted forces in the United States, 30.2 percent of the [U.S.] Army, 18.5 percent of the [U.S.] Navy, 17.1 percent of the [U.S.] Marines and 16.8 percent of the [U.S.] Air Force, and all these figures are above the proportion of African Americans in the total population which is about 11.5 percent.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think what you're seeing there is, is the Army--you know, I talked a long time ago here about, even when I was a little kid, about the Army was colorblind.  I had opportunity in the Army.  My, when I lived at Fort Leavenworth [Kansas] as a little kid, that was the first real integrated place I'd ever really lived.  So I think minorities, in particular, see that, can see the military as a place of opportunity and where they can get an equal shot.  I also, though, see that, you know, you tend to see a lot of minorities, African Americans, in particular, can be overrepresented in say, the com--some of the combat units.  And some people would say, well, you know, they, they're being put out there as cannon fodder or things of that nature.  But I'm not one that believes that at all because I would say, you know, your most elite forces, those people who are out on the point of the spear, they're not thinking about cannon fodder.  We don't put people out--the military, the U.S. Army doesn't have cannon fodder, human capital is not cannon fodder.  We don't ever, we don't look at it that way.  That might have been some [American] Civil War mentality, but that's not the mentality today, or not my, not since I've been in the Army.  You know, so when I hear that, I don't subscribe to that as being legitimate.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you think for the most part, it's because of the opportunities that--
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think it's the opportunities.  Maybe there's no--you know, we tend to do, when the Army is, the Army does, or the military does best in terms of recruiting when there's problems in the, on the civil section, in terms of job opportunities, and when there is plenty opportunities in the civil section, that's when the military tends to have bigger challenges in terms of recruiting.  And so if there's opportunity, you know, in the military, I think people naturally gravitate to that to seek that opportunity.
Speaker 1: Now, these are figures that represent, figures in an all-volunteer force, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: No one--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and this is no comp--yeah, nobody's compelling these people to be in a particular military occupational specialty.  And nobody's compelling them, right, to be in the military, period.  So that adds to my point even more.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's the lay of the land in 1997.
Story_ID: 36397
Speaker 1: Now, you're in a, you're a lieutenant colonel by this point?
Speaker 2: I'm a lieutenant colonel, right, had been selected for lieutenant colonel.  I came out of the, out battalion command, and I was selected at that time to go be the chief of operations for the 18th Airborne Corps, so the largest war-fighting corps, airborne corps in the world, is the 18th Airborne Corps.  It is headquartered at Fort Bragg [North Carolina] as well.  Well, this same man who I told you about a little while ago, when I was a Deputy G-3 back as a major who was the G-3 of the 82nd Airborne Division, has now grown up himself, commanding a brigade and is now the G-3 of the 18th Airborne Corps.  And he came to get me from the battalion commander to come be his chief of operations, of current operations.  So I did that for a year, and then when it was, which was a phenomenal experience, one of the largest--I participated in one of the largest airborne assaults since World War II, the big exercise they had up there called Purple Dragon.  General Jack Keane was the corps commander then.  And it was really trying to reinvigorate the power of airborne operations and the flexibility it gave combatant commanders.  I, then, towards the end of that year, I had a wonderful thing happen to me.  I had been selected to go to the Army War College.  So I knew I was gonna go do that next.
Story_ID: 36398
Speaker 1: And then I had been nominated and picked to go command a ranger battalion, which there has never been a black ranger battalion commander.  And I was ecstatic that I was gonna go--and I was going to 2nd Ranger Battalion up in Fort Lewis, Washington.  And the regimental commander said, hey, you might--we wanna keep our commanders for two years.  You might actually have to command that battalion, even as a colonel, for up to six months to a year because I gotta keep the continuity.  You know, are you willing to do that?  And I said, absolutely, I'd love to go back and command a regiment battalion.  And so I was all excited about doing that, and then he told me, he says, okay, one caveat.  If you get selected for brigade command which will come out between the time you go to this ranger battalion, and if you come out on the brigade command list, I cannot, I will not be able to keep you as a ranger battalion commander to defer going to a brigade.  That wouldn't make sense.  And the Army wouldn't let me do it.  And that happened.  So good news is I got picked up early to command a brigade.  Bad news is, because I did, it caused me not to be able to go to that ranger battalion.  And so I ended up going to the War College, and then coming right out of there and going straight into brigade command.  And it came right back to my beloved 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the third time now (laughter), you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it is here that I, I'm just, I'm most comfortable, most prepared, best fit for that job of any I've ever had, was that job there.  I mean I knew that place inside and out--
Speaker 2: I would guess (laughter)--
Speaker 1: I'd been the head of operations of the organization above it at Corps.  I've been the WG-3 of the 87--of the division, that, which it was in.  I've been a battalion commander, I've been a major, I mean I was thriving.  That was a great assignment.
Speaker 2: Fort Bragg again, right?
Speaker 1: Fort Bragg.
Speaker 2: Fort Bragg, North Carolina, okay.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 36399
Speaker 1: Now, this is, this takes us to the year 2000, right?
Speaker 2: Yep, so I was, my oldest daughter [Bethany] is about to graduate from college--or correction, high school.  She's been selected to go to the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, which we're excited about.  My division commander, a guy named J.R. Vines, great American, who I served with numerous times, says to me, he goes, hey, as spring comes around, I'm gonna need a new chief of staff of the division.  He goes nobody knows the division better than you.  I'd like you to stay in the 82nd Airborne Division as my chief of staff, after you come out of brigade command for a year.  I'm gonna go seek that now so that, because I know you're gonna get sought to be like a military advisor to the chairman or to the chief or something like that, which a lot of former brigade commanders do.  And I said, sir, I sign up.  I was excited.  It was gonna let me be quasi near my daughter, going to college for her freshman year.  And I had another daughter, Number Two, was gonna be a senior.  So it was gonna let me get her through her senior year.  So everything was great.  I get a call in say, April.  And I'm gonna change command in May.  And I get a call in April saying, Colonel Brooks?  Yes.  Hey, I'm calling you from assignments branch.  You're gonna be, you're gonna be reassigned.  You're gonna go be the special assistant to the commanding general, 1st Armor Division in Germany.  And I said, no, I'm not.  I'm gonna be chief of staff of the 82nd Airborne Division.  He goes, let me try this again.  And this time he said, congratulations, you're gonna be the special assistant to the commanding general, 1st Armor Division.  What he was telling me was that I was on the one-star list which had not come out yet.  But I'm already coming out of command.  So instead of, you know, sending me some place that I, you know, that didn't make sense, they sent me to the job they wanted me to have as a one star.  But they sent me even before it came out that I was gonna be a one star.  And I was, you know, and I said, wow, and this is something I really admired General [Eric] Shinseki. He was the Chief of Staff of the [U.S.] Army at the time.  And so when you think about the, everything I've described to you, 101st Airborne Division, Air Assault, four and a half years, 1st Ranger Battalion, Airborne, four years, three different assignments in the 82nd Airborne Division, okay.  And what do they do to me when I become a general, they send me to the heaviest unit in the Army in Germany, which I've never been, okay.
Story_ID: 36400
Speaker 1: Now, it was, it was a great experience and it worked out because what it did was, it took me totally out of my comfort zone.  It exposed me to a piece of the [U.S.] Army I had not really been involved with.  I got mentored and coached by great leaders over there, and, you know what?  I brought things to them that they didn't know or do because of where I had come from with my experiences.
Speaker 2: So you're saying there might be some wisdom in this--
Speaker 1: Oh, it was great wisdom.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, you know, I thought, you know, in doing that.  It's a risk--I don't know if that's something I'd do with everybody, but it's a risk worth taking if you think you have somebody who can pull it off.  So packed up, went over there, and did that.  Before I went, I literally said, okay, I told you that he called me in April.  I'm changing in May.  As soon as I changed in May, I had a couple weeks.  I said, okay.  I called Fort Knox [Kentucky], the Armor School, and I said, I need the best master gunner, tanker you can find to spend a week with me teaching me about a tank, and about the capabilities of the armored force and whatever, and I--good ole E-7, master gunner, do that.  And then I went to Fort Benning [Georgia], and I had somebody do that on a Bradley, fighting vehicle, the infantry fighting vehicle, the same way for a week.  And so, you know, what I've learned, and this was the thing why I think it's a wise thing to try is that a lot of the things, the nuance, the tactics of fighting and all that, they're no different, may move at a different pace, may have different ranges or weapon capability, but in the end, you need to know how to integrate 'em all, right, bring in fire support, bring in air support, set conditions to let your people get to where they need to be so that they can, at the decisive moment in time, they have an overwhelming advantage.  That's the same whether you're an Airborne guy or you're a Mec guy.  And it's just how you do it.  So anyway, it was a wonderful experience in Germany.
Story_ID: 36401
Speaker 1: I was there [U.S. Army; 1st Armor Division, Germany] on 9/11 [September 11, 2001; terrorist attacks on the United States].  I was actually in Hungary on a deployment.  My division had probably a third of the division, half the division almost, was in Hungary on a major exercise with the Hungarian Army.  These guys were using Soviet equipment.  We had just done a major, live-fire maneuver with a U.S. and a Hungarian armored unit.  I mean we have Hine helicopters flying with Apaches.  We have all kinds of things happening (unclear) jointly.  The president of the country was there.  At that particular event, I was the senior U.S. military official.  And after it was over with, we had lunch out in a tent, out in the field with the president and their leadership.  And it was literally, believe it or not, that was a rehearsal for the next day, a whole bunch of NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] leaders were coming in.  And at this time, Hungary was trying to become part of NATO.  So the president was kind of watching the dress rehearsal before that big NATO event.  And while we were, after the president left, me and my Hungarian general counterpart were kind of doing high five's about, hey, wasn't that great, great show.  And that's when I got the phone call, telling me, you know, over there, it was lunchtime in the afternoon, that it had happened.  And I got--then I called my commanding general, Rick Sanchez, who told me, leave everybody down there--remember, we don't know what's going on at that time, leave everybody down there.  Put one of the brigade commanders in charge, get back here as fast as possible.  And so I literally got on a helicopter which is--that's a long way to fly in a helicopter and flew for hours to get back to Germany to start securing our locations and trying to figure out how we're gonna secure all our population.  The thing I'll never forget about that was, I was down in my emergency operations center.  I was responsible physically--I lived in a town called Baumholder.  The Baumholder concern was one of "the" largest Army concerns or Army locations in Germany, right, in terms of troop population.  It had a high school.  It had a couple middle schools, and elementary schools.  It had a middle school.  It was, it was a, it had a maneuver brigade on it, it had an engineer brigade.  It had a lot of stuff on it.  And that's where I lived.  And so I was trying to synchronize and coordinate how we were gonna secure our base because we had pockets of housing that was out in the community.  And again, at that first few days, nobody knew where this was emanating from, what was, who was another target or whatever.  And as I was in my emergency operations center, working on this plan, my garrison commander walked up to me and says, you have got to go to the front gate.  I said, I don't have time to go to the front gate.  Sir, you have got to go to the front gate.  And I said, why?  He says the mayor and almost, the whole town is at the front gate.  And so I got in my vehicle, and went up there.  And a very touching thing, and that was the mayor, Mayor Peas [ph.], was his name, Mayor Peas and all the citizens of Baumholder.  They had shut down school, and they were there with votive candles and flowers.  And we had 'em locked out, you know, at that point.  They couldn't come in the gate, where before, the day before, it would have been a total open post.  You could do, come in and out as you wanted.  And all these people down there to show their solidarity, you know, with us.  And he says, I'm so sorry.  We're with you, we're with you, very important thing for me in term of I--my love for the German people and how they were with us during that time.  And their local police were incredible in terms of like anywhere we had pockets to secure our people.  And, you know, we had scares here and there, a lot of stuff just because we kind of thought it was something, it wasn't, you know, over there--.
Story_ID: 36402
Speaker 1: And then we start--and a little while later, we start planning for what we were gonna do in Iraq from over there.
Speaker 2: I think first came Afghanistan, though, right?  To try to find the--
Speaker 1: Well, we started, we were never planning--
Speaker 2: Okay, you, okay, you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --to go to Iraq.  We were totally focused on Iraq.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're right.  There was an Airborne operation, my old ranger unit, okay, that parachuted into Afghanistan, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that was the 82nd Airborne?
Speaker 1: No, that was the 75th Ranger Regiment.
Speaker 2: Okay, oh, the rangers, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they did, you're correct.  They did that.  And then there was 101st and 10th Mountain Division went in there, going after Osama Bin Laden, okay.  That, in the (unclear) Shellery Code Valley.  That was 101st, 10th Mountain Division, convention wise, that were doing that.  The very first people, you know, major ground combat, other than special forces though, was like the 75th Ranger Regiment.  They jumped on Kandahar Airfield, as I recall.
Story_ID: 36403
Speaker 1: Now, the U.S., when the U.S. announced the invasion of Iraq or even was, the build up to it, the presentation that General [Colin] Powell before the U.N. [United Nations], did you have any second thoughts about that?  I know soldiers don't necessarily question their orders, but I'm just--I just wonder--
Speaker 2: Not really, and we were shooting (unclear), when we were starting to plan for that, I still remember, my corps commander, Lieutenant General Scott Wallace, called all the generals up to his headquarters and put us in the classified skiff, you know, location.  It was really interesting.  I said, and he goes, "Gentlemen, I've been given a task to start planning something that I have been worrying about for weeks.  And I don't wanna be the only one worrying about it.  So now, you're gonna help me worry about."  And then they briefed us on what was going on and what our plan was.  And then we started coordinating the, you know, what we were gonna do in terms of heavy forces, you know, putting stuff on ships and going down there.  And then, so--and that was probably December, January, something like that.  I left, so that, yeah, so that was September.  By December-January, we were already thinking about it.  Then I went to, but then the summer came, right, and I already thought, this is the second time, one of many times this happened to me, the four star over there, General Meigs, Monty Meigs, said to me, he goes, hey, I want you to stay over here and how'd you like to be the corps chief of staff of the Fifth Corps.  So, you know, now, I'm gonna go be the chief of staff of a mechanized corps, you know.  And I was good to do that 'cause it was gonna go down range and it was gonna keep me another year in Europe, which I was having fun over there.  And I adapted to that well.  And General [Eric] Shinseki came over, witnessed me and my division going through war planning for Iraq, like something, and the next thing you know, my assignment's changed.  I'm gonna be commandant of West Point [United States Military Academy].  And, you know, you're going to West Point, which from--being Fifth Corps chief of staff would have been great, but having the honor of being responsible for training and educating and mentoring and being a role model for the corps cadets was, you know, just a phenomenal honor that I could, I mean it was just an incredible experience.  So that's, so I ended up going there.
Story_ID: 36404
Speaker 1: And I'll never forget.  So I was, I swore in the first class on the first day [at the United States Military Academy at West Point]--they call it reception day of 2002, the first class past 9/11 [September 11, 2001; terrorist attacks], post-9/11, you know.  The kids that came in there all knew what they were getting into.  We hadn't even really fought really yet, but they all knew that that, they coming in time of war.  And--
Speaker 2: This is the first class that's come in, in a time of really, real war since--
Speaker 1: Well, see like Desert Storm, Panama, all those things were fast.  They were short and they were over, you know.  They were months, and they're done, right.  This, this was a, the nation is at war, you know, and I mean, shoot, what's it been?  Eleven years.  So--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I will tell you that in the time since I was the commandant of cadets, there are probably, at least twenty-six students that were there while I was there that have been killed in action between Afghanistan and Iraq, at least twenty-six.  And these young people paying a big price.  But, you know, they're all signing up, I mean they're not--and I'm telling you, and I know a lot of them, you know.  And it's, this is--but they all sign up for it.  I mean they know what they're getting into.  I mean no one's signing up to die, but I mean they sign up knowing that's a potential risk.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I had a, it was a wonderful experience being there.
Speaker 2: So, it seems like I should go back to how you found out you were gonna be commander at West Point.  I mean that's really a big thing and I don't know.  I mean how did you feel about that?
Speaker 1: I was struggling.  It was sort of like when I got, found out I was gonna be the aide [-de-camp] to the chief of staff of the [U.S.] Army and when I found out I was gonna be the commander of a brigade in the 82nd [Airborne Division], I was like, I was like humbled.  I thought about the giants.  I knew who had had that job before.  I thought about the opportunity to touch future generations.  I thought about how I viewed my commandant when  I was a cadet and what that person was.  And at the time, I was really hungry.  I was looking forward to it.
Speaker 2: Who was the commandant when you were a cadet?
Speaker 1: John C. Bard, B-A-R-D, well, so I had--there were two.  So the first one I had was Walter Ulmer, and the second one was John Bard, B-A-R-D.  Nobody forgets their commandant.  You might not remember some things, but you don't forget who your commandant was when you were a cadet.
Story_ID: 36405
Speaker 1: Typically, how long does a commandant stay [at the United States Military Academy at West Point]?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's an interesting thing.  So what they'll do is, is so there's three generals at West Point, right.  There's a superintendent, there's a commandant, and there's a dean.  The superintendent's a three star.  It's by mandate the way the [U.S.] Army does it now is that guy is gonna have that job.  He's gonna do it for four years and he's gonna retire.  And so he can't be influenced by other people because he's trying to get promoted or whatever.  So that's a four-year job, and you get the stability of somebody that's kind of running a university as a president of the university.  You got the dean.  The dean is normally a, is always somebody who used to be a department head of one of the academic departments.  That job's five years.  So this, that person kind of has grown up through the academic system at West Point, wearing a uniform, is active-duty military, but, you know, preponderance of their military career is as a professor.  So then you got the, you have that.  You have those two bookends, right, this academic professional and this senior president, kind of guy, who's over, top of everything.  So then how do you make sure you have relevance in terms of what do we want our, the military aspect, in terms of what we want ingrained and the warrior ethos we want ingrained in our cadets.  How do we make 'em, you know, street smart, you know, how do we make them to be good ambassadors out there?  How do we teach 'em to be good leaders to deal with adversity, those kinds of things.  While all, every aspect of the cadet experience has a role in that, the Office of the Commandant is principally responsible for it.  And that person's only there two years for a reason.  And that's because they want somebody, the mud is still wet on their boots.  They know what the field needs 'cause they just came from it, you know.  And if you stay too long, you lose your edge.
Speaker 1: You get out of touch.
Speaker 2: You get out of touch.  And so that's why they normally just keep that job two years.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now, what does the--well, you know, this is simple question.  What does the commandant do, you know, serves as basically a college president and--
Speaker 2: No, the commandant, I would, the commandant has sort of the role of he or she is sort of the, I would call it the dean of students, serves in that kind of capacity, responsible for some educational things.  For example, on military training, responsible for physical education, which is an academic course, and has academic requirements, responsible for managing and enforcing the honor code in our system.  Responsible for ethics training.  So, and then oversees all the clubs and things like that, extracurricular activities that occur.  So, for example, like, you know, the sailing club, the mountain climbing club, the scuba club, all those kinds of activities and intramural activities, the rugby club, team, all those things kind of fall under the commandant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's like the dean of students and provost or something.
Story_ID: 36406
Speaker 1: What were some of the actual issues that you had to deal with when you were commandant of West Point [United States Military Academy]?
Speaker 2: So, while I was commandant, it was the same time that the [U.S.] Air Force Academy had some issues with command climate or climate as it relates to sexual harassment by students, not by faculty, but, you know, men sexual abuse, or whatever, of men to women.
Speaker 1: Because women are at the Air Force Academy now and at West Point.
Speaker 2: And there were--they all came in together in 1980--
Speaker 1: 1980.
Speaker 2: --the Class of 1980.  So 1976 is when they all, all of three of 'em at the same time.  So, you know, we, you know, same students, same kind of issues.  Okay, we had our share of incidents like that where you might have had, where you had inappropriate relationships between, you know, maybe a freshman and senior or you had female, you know, you had sexual assault allegations.  You know, we had a couple of those too.  I had one real bad thing where I had just this brilliant female student, academically gifted, who, but was involved in selling cocaine.  I mean she got thrown out and went to jail, you know, unusual, incredibly unusual, but we had that happen.  Had a case where a guy, where a student actually--we had to deal with things like pirating information.  So in this day of technology, people download Napster, download songs and things of that nature.  Okay, so that's how they all grew up doing that, that that's acceptable.  But that is stealing, proprietary music from a--and we had to work through how technology--changes in technology, how does it affect our ethical behavior and what is an accepted norm, things like that.
Story_ID: 36677
Speaker 1: So the, at any rate, we had issues like that [at the United States Military Academy at West Point; Brooks was the commandant of cadets there from 2002-2004].  I mean I, thankfully, I don't recall--I had one kid that died while I was there, now that I think about it.
Speaker 2: Was that due to some hazing or something?
Speaker 1: No, this young man, his name was Todd Hoinkling (ph.).  I won't forget him either 'cause I was with him when he was actually pronounced dead.  This young man was a sophomore.  He was trying out for the Marathon Team.  They had like an eight-mile trial run, and it ended about 200 feet from my quarters where I lived at West Point.  And he, just ran, there were water stations and things, but anyway, as he--he ran himself to the point of heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and he was running--he was, I am not kidding you, he was 150 yards from the finish line, and he just collapsed, literally in the, right in front of the dean's house, next door to me.  And he got back up, took about three more steps and then boom, went down hard.  They called the ambulance and took him up to the emergency room.  And he died.  And just unbelievable.  I mean they worked on him hard and trying to get him revived, but died.  And so that was a, that was a hard thing, you know, but, to deal with.  And then to talk, trying to find his parents and tell his parents.  And then I took a contingent of cadets to present the flag to his mother, which was a hard thing.  So that's the one loss I had while I was there or I had, or we had as an academy.  I feel like they're mine too.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, here you are.  This is maybe almost a hundred years since the first African American, you know, attended West Point for the first time.  Was there any incidents of racism when you were there?
Speaker 1: There were isolated, not, not--there were no incidents of racism that I would call institutional.  There were incidents of racism that were individual.  People who would use racial comments, racial slurs.  People that might get you, may focus on you.  You clearly could tell that it was racially motivated in terms of the veracity of their anger, in terms of how they might direct things at you.  I think that the--there were enough, and I witnessed this with women too, by the way, okay, when they came in, a similar pattern because there were some that just didn't want them there, and said I'm gonna do everything in my power to run 'em all out.  And the same thing you had with some blacks, you know, with African Americans there.  The good news was that, you know, if you knew that was the case, and you could prove it, you could sure--you know, no one was gonna tolerate it.  The problem you have is is, if you're--especially, if you're an underclassman, a freshman, you know, you tend as a victim, sometimes people fear saying something for fear that if, you know, the wrath could be even worse if the perpetrator is not thrown out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I take it that a freshman's subject to a lot of wrath anyway, just as--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.  And so I think that--and maybe as a freshman having a little bit less trust in the system than somebody who's more senior might have because they've witnessed the system to be fair.  A freshman doesn't have that perspective.  They know you've told them, but they don't have it.
Story_ID: 36678
Speaker 1: This occurred to me, and I don't know if you had any or not, but were there any Arab Americans at West Point?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Going through?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, not only are there some, there are actually international students at West Point who are actually from those countries as international exchange students, from Iraq, from Afghanistan, both.
Speaker 1: So it--
Speaker 2: And from other countries.
Speaker 1: The 9/11 [terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001] perpetrators were basically from Egypt and Saudi Arabia and I think--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Syria, I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, I know Egypt and Saudi.  I'm not sure of all of them, but, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And I would, and U.S. relations with those countries was still solid, I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, thankfully, we don't, you know, because of the act of a few, we don't say the whole nation is bad, you know.  It's easy for people to generalize and get there, you're right, you know, but thankfully, we don't, haven't had to--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But did they have a rougher time in the population?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean not that I recall.  Now, let me state.  When I was the commandant, right, we didn't have exchange students from those countries 'cause we hadn't invaded there yet, you know, not really.  I mean we were just starting, right, our operations over there.  Matter of fact, the ground war in which my brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker] was the spokesman for, I can remember watching that when I was the commandant.  I was going, I was in the airport going to Paris [France] to give a speech when that happened, you know.  I guess it was March.  And, you know, and I had come in the previous June, you know, June to that role.
Speaker 1: This is 2003, for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --just to refresh people.
Story_ID: 36679
Speaker 1: So, now, what was, how did you feel about, I mean I've read here in the material that we have that you have strong feelings about the role of the chaplain?
Speaker 2: Yep, I do.  I tell you what.  Every unit I've ever been in, I've seen the chaplain serve as a force multiplier.  I told you how important the chaplain was for me when I was a cadet in terms of giving me inner strength and support or help me find inner strength and support, when I was a freshman and then continue on through that.  So, everywhere I've ever been, I've used my chaplains.  When I was a brigade commander, the first thing, and I did it on purpose, the first thing I did when I was a brigade commander, and after I took command, I took command.  I went in my headquarters, and they said, my sergeant major said, sir, who do you wanna see first?  You wanna go see the battalion commanders, you wanna see--I said, I want the chaplain.  What?  (Laughter).  Get me the chaplain.  And the chaplain comes into my office, and I said, you know, I didn't make any public thing with everybody I had--me and him 'cause I knew the word was gonna get out, but it was personal and it was heartfelt.  I said, chaplain, I want you to pray, I want you to pray for me, okay, that I will lead this brigade, you know, honorably and, you know, with integrity, and I would bring, you know, the honor due this organization and provide the best leadership that I can and that you would help guide me in doing that, that God will help guide me in doing that.  And he was like, really?  (Laughter)  So anyway, that's how I started.  When I was the commandant of West Point [United States Military Academy], I used to, once a month, I used to have all the chaplains--there was a chaplain for each one of the regiments, meet with me because I knew just because of my own experience that when something's churning, if there's racial things going on, if there's sexual issues that are happening going on, if there's some serious incident going on at somebody's home and they're contemplating suicide, if those things happen, for a lot of people, they're gonna go confide in that chaplain, okay, for some moral support in terms of how to deal with that they're dealing with.  And I didn't want and didn't expect and didn't get anybody violating some confidentiality.  But they could give me a sense better than almost anybody, in terms of what is the vibe going on in my unit?  What is the, what are issues that are contentious that you might not even know they're percolating out there.  And they really valued that, and they knew, and they could actually tell there's, there are people that come to see them, that, you know, hey, I'm gonna talk to, I'm gonna be able to talk to commandant, and I'm gonna be able to keep you in confidence, you know.  If you got something we need to raise, you need to tell me, you know, and they would.  And they'd tell me.  And then I could go do something about it, okay.  At my level, I had the ability to do something quick.  And so I really valued them as a force multiplier like that.
Story_ID: 36680
Speaker 1: Now, did you kind of dole out punishment the way you were describing when you were commander of a unit or a division of, I mean--
Speaker 2: Ah--
Speaker 1: --in terms of not, of using alternative punishment?
Speaker 2: Right, so yes and no.  So the, the--normally, for me, okay, I was normally an appellate authority or I, at my level, I was--
Speaker 1: So, by the time it got to you, it was--
Speaker 2: Somebody already decided something or they were recommending something, okay.  Now, so that's the "no" part.  So I didn't, I wasn't in as much, you know, I mean things were already happening, and I was maybe checking appellate authority.  Now, here's the "yes" part.  There were numerous occasions where, okay, something would come to me like honor cases are the most common, not a discipline, but an honor case.  I, and it would be in my court in terms of what would be the recommendations to the superintendent?  The superintendent generally is too far away from it to overturn something that I'm gonna do as the Commandant if what I'm doing is legally sufficient.  And so, you know you're the decider.  And you know that what you're doing is, determines whether this person's life is altered for life.  They're gonna have to leave or not.  They're gonna stay, it's still altered, but they stay and get a second chance.  And I would look in people's souls.  I would try to understand who they were, what they were.  And I did try to, if I could, if I could, I'd defer on the side of, okay, if I really thought you were pinned, and you didn't violate something that for the good order and discipline of the organization, I couldn't look past it.  If I could, I would give 'em a chance.  I'd still maybe do something, but maybe I'd give 'em a chance.  Like maybe I'd turn 'em back.  I'd make 'em repeat a semester or repeat a year instead of throwing 'em out, depending on what it was, you know.  I'm not a big believer in people that go everything's black and white, and every situation is the same in each and every case.  I think that's crazy, you know.  There are absolute, we have absolute standards about things, right?  But there're mitigating circumstances around each one of those incidents.  And you have to think through those things, especially when you're dealing with somebody's future.  And I tended to be more like that than not.  A lot of people thought I was hard, you know, but I, but I would be--there are things that were common threads.  If I wasn't, you know, okay, look, if you violated these things, you're gonna be dead, you know.  If you, but if I see that you--it wasn't a, I mean it was a stupid thing or whatever, maybe I'm gonna figure out how you're gonna get punished, but you're not gonna get the death penalty.  That's sort of how I looked at it.
Story_ID: 36681
Speaker 1: Okay, we have a quote that you said at a certain, I guess in a presentation that, the military is a profession with higher ethical standards than the rest of society.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: And, okay, can you kind of elaborate on that?
Speaker 2: I think if you just look at what you see in everyday life, I don't care, even [U.S.] Congress, the things that occur with individuals, okay, in the workplace and in civil organizations, I mean in commercial organizations and, or in government, other branches of government, there is much more tolerance for those people than those who wear the uniform.  We are, I think the country looks at us and expects us in the military to be held to a higher standard.  We're in a profession, and that profession has a higher, moral ethos than a lot of other professions do because it deals with human lives more than others do.  And so therefore, it's, sometimes some might see something happen on television, and you say, well, why?  I can't believe for that they threw this general out or the punished this general for that.  Well, people generally, within the profession, see it and go, well, you know, we hold ourselves to a higher standard.  And by holding ourselves to a higher standard, we keep ourselves pure.  And people are gonna make mistakes, people are human.  Nobody's without sin, you know.  But, you know, we are at a higher level than I would say, the normal society, in terms of what we expect for each other.  And we hold--we keep each other accountable, accordingly.
Speaker 1: Okay, you also said that you believe that a person is obligated to serve their country, whether it be in the military or some other form.
Speaker 2: I agree with that too.  I mean I tell you what, you know, my experiences that, I mean I've been very fortunate.  I've been around the world.  I've been in every crap hole place that the U.S. Army has got a troop.  And Americans don't generally appreciate how good they have it.  We got our warts in our democracy.  That's for sure.  Nobody would say we don't.  Some of the things I see, and what's going on in Congress now, and stalemate, not doing the right things to get, you know, get--for example, our troops funded, you know, I think is abominable, right.  At the same time, we have, we live in the greatest country in the world.  We really, really do.  And you'd know that if you went out and saw, people would die to have what we have.  And I think it's not too much to ask for every able-bodied citizen to be able to give a little bit of their life to keep it that way.  And I'm not saying you gotta pick up a gun.  It could be public service.  It could be counseling in prisons.  It could be mentoring kids in the disadvantaged schools.  It could be planting trees, you know, out in some area that's been deforested, you know.  There are a hundred thousand different ways to help make this country stronger than it is.  And it does include, though, making it safe.  And I think we'd be much better off if everybody else had a stake in it as opposed to feeling like what they had, what we have is an entitlement, as opposed to feeling like it's something I need to cherish and help protect.
Speaker 1: Now, do you embrace the concept of national service as in the Corporation for National [and Community] Service, Americorps, and--
Speaker 2: I do.  I actually do.  You know, I'm not sure how, you know, I couldn't say that it needs to be one year, two years, five years or whatever it is.  But I do.  I think there should be a need for national service in some way, you know.  And who knows, maybe it is in your summers, while you're a college student, you have to--if you chose to, you could do "x", "y" and "z" for, you know, for four summers.  Or maybe it is you got a year, you do something or you use your profession to do something.  But we have, we have interns here at my company.  We have interns all over the place doing something.  Why can't we have interns doing, you know, focused on doing things?  We do, like City Year and other groups like that, you know, that are out there trying to make the world a better place, make our country a better place, and I think there's nothing wrong with expecting people to contribute to that.
Story_ID: 36682
Speaker 1: Okay, we talked about the high standard that the military holds for itself, and there's an expectation from the public that the military, you know--
Speaker 2: I, right.
Speaker 1: --maintains a higher standard.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But if you could change something in the military yourself, I mean just ideally, what would you change?
Speaker 2: So this will not meant to be, sound as double talk.  I think that there is not an appreciation for the sacrifices that we put these men and women through and the--I'll call it (unclear) rules and regulations which are meant to protect the American taxpayer that are absolute silly nuisances, okay, and annoyances that I think just, that just turn off our leaders and make 'em wanna just say forget it.  An example.  I gotta go to a formal event where I'm gonna be, where I, where there'll be alcohol served or whatever at that event.  I'm a general, and if I'm not the chief of staff of the [U.S.] Army or maybe some combatant commander, okay, I could drive myself to my office and I could have and it's unofficially then, and I could have my driver take me, but I couldn't have the driver come to my house and get me 'cause it violates domicile to duty rule.  So you want me to go to the office, get in the military vehicle, have the military vehicle to take me to the event.  Then the military vehicle, 'cause it, 'cause I can go to my, to a military location.  I just can't go to my home, right.  And then drive the vehicle to wherever I gotta go and then come back, and then have to get in my car after I drink a glass of wine or whatever, and go back.  You know, I gotta take a spouse.  I'm in my office in the Pentagon.  I have to go--I live on Fort Myer [Virginia].  I need to go to an event.  That car can't go get my spouse from that government quarter location.  So it's relatively close and come get me, take me to that event.  Nah, she gotta drive in and do it, so therefore, when we come back, we have to go get in--and transfer to a civilian car to go home.  Yeah, there's perks that these people get, but the responsibility that we're putting on us, is incredibly significant.  And I think that gets minimized.  And I see people criticizing them, goes all these, they have enlisted aides, and they have, you know, guys that help cook their meals.  Well, when--well, shoot, these, you know, some of the stuff that we're asking these people to do is so significant and the time we're asking them to contribute to it, guess what?  You probably have it in corporate America.  Somebody who has equal responsibility, you know.  Why are we holding them to a different standard?  [U.S.] Congress gets it.  You know, so I don't like some of the rules that are in place like that, that are meant to protect the taxpayer, but in essence, they burden people.
Story_ID: 36683
Speaker 1: I'd like to see a, I think I'd like to see a system that would help promote--I don't know what's going on, why we're having all these issues with sexual assault right now, sexual harassment in the military, but I do know that what we tend to do is we tend to, I'll say--I'm not gonna say overreact, but we tend to, we tend to, wherever the pendulum is, we swing way to the other side so then every, you know, everything is, you almost can't, you're almost forced into certain actions.  I mean just look what's happening.  So there are members of Congress that wanna take the authority away from commanders, the chairmen, all the combatant commanders, and their ability to perform UCMJ, Uniform Code of Military Justice because they don't think that the commanders will legally do something right.  So we're just gonna take it away from 'em and create a special court for it.  That kind of mentality to me is ludicrous.  What they ought to be thinking about is, okay, well, okay, why did those commanders, if there was a case you didn't like, make that decision?  And, and figure out what it is that you've gotta do to, you know, make sure they get the right training, if it--if there's a trend.  I tell you, I don't believe there's a, you know, that's a trend like that.  What I think you have is, you have people who, they're going off of the law, they're going off of what their legal counsel tells 'em.  They're going after maybe the mitigating circumstances associated with it.  And there's a whole lot of things that go into--and I know this from being a commandant [of cadets] at West Point [United States Military Academy], mitigating circumstances go into every event like that.  We absolutely had to protect all of our people.  We have to protect the women in our workforce, absolutely.  They should feel absolutely safe just like every--you know, men do.  But we don't want an environment where a man gets to the point where he can't even enter into a room with a colleague that happens to be a woman because he's afraid, what if she says I sexually assaulted her?  You're moving to that kind of extreme, I think.
Speaker 2: Have you ever had to, did you ever have to discipline a cadet for sexual harassment when you were commandant?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean in some cases I threw cadets out, you know.  Absolutely, more than once.  And so I think, I mean in one case, did it, and I had the parents come see me to explain to me why--and I knew the parents, why I should give their kid a fourth chance or whatever.  You know, he had had minor things and that's, un-un.  I don't want that going into my Army and then being, bringing that kind of mentality into the Army that you, 'cause that guy was a military professional too, the father, that you and I said we would never allow.  That's one of those cases where I looked into the soul, and I could see, you're not different.  You haven't changed.  That wasn't an honest mistake.  That wasn't a, you know, whatever.  That was the, you're out, you know, so.  I, so absolutely.  I've done it in both cases.
Story_ID: 36684
Speaker 1: Now, was there a highlight to being the commandant [of cadets] of West Point [United States Military Academy]?
Speaker 2: I'd say the bookends [ph.].  So, well, the bookends are two days, are highlights for me.  The first highlight is, the frontend bookend is, I can't tell you what it feels like on R-Day, the day they arrive.  They all arrive, different shapes, sizes, haircuts, different clothes, and at the end of the day their parents are all, the ones that come up there, nervous, sick, you know.  They know their kid's going through some trial.  And they don't get to really see 'em, right?  Then at the end of that day, that first day, they all come marching out.  They're all in uniform.  They all got a haircut.  They all know how to salute, you know, and they, and the commandant is the one that gets to swear them in, to the United States Corps Cadets, you know.  And to have that honor, to do that out on Trophy Point on the Hudson River, have 1,400 of these brand new, highly motivated, charged up, young people getting ready to start their journey in life, in the military, to swear them in is the most powerful feeling, awesome feeling, you know, one of the one's, most awesome things I've ever experienced, to see that and all that that's out there, looking at you.  And then the bookend of that would be those that are experiencing the same experience I told you about when I graduated, of that sense of accomplishment, that total humbleness to think that, God, you helped, you got me through, you know, that feeling of rejoicing, of enduring that hardship at the other end, watching that, both times.  Man, I tell you what, that put tears in your eyes, me, it did anyway, on both ends.
Story_ID: 36685
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you have become, from what I've read here, somewhat of a historian on black participation at West Point, and some of the cadets who have come through and the struggles of your ancestors.  You wanna give us a little bit of history?
Speaker 2: Sure, so, I mean, and so, actually, the, you know, Henry O. Flipper was the first graduate of West Point.  And to think that that guy--I think of the kind of abuse, I'll call it the ritualistic kinds of things I went through in 1975, to think what he was doing back in the 1800s is just unbelievable, you know.  And so, and then there was a number of years, and I don't recall exactly what it is.  It might have been ten or twelve until Charles Young came along after Flipper and graduated.  But then, you know, the system got him and as it got a lot of people in the beginning.  And it's like I used to tell people, and I believe this.  You know, you can't be--when I went to the Ranger Regiment, I knew I had to do this.  My dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] told me this.  You can't be as good as your counterpart.  You cannot be.  If you're as good, you're gonna fail.  You have to be better.  You have to be so good that the people who you are serving with can't afford not to have you on their team, you know.  That's what I kind of went through.  That's what guys like, I think like Charles Young tried to do.  He got, he got accused of stealing payroll and I think it was at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  He was court martialed.  He went out of the [U.S.] Army, but he still wanted to serve his country.  He took an appointment where he actually did something--I think it was Panama or in South America, still serving the Department of--, you know, the U.S. government, but in that role.  You look at guys like Benjamin O. Davis, Class of 1936, was basically, silenced where nobody would talk to him, at the direction of his own classmates.  The head classmate, by the way, his classmate that did that, was William C. Westmoreland, okay, who we all tout as this great leader in Vietnam.  That guy was the instigator for not letting, you know, of trying to run Benjamin O. Davis out because he was black.  Benjamin O. Davis died on 4th of July in 2002.  And I tell you what, I had the great honor as the commandant of cadets to then take, you know, West Point cadets, down there with me to his funeral, to the place that, you know, really didn't treat him all that well.  But he was honored to graduate from there, but never really kind of went back there and did anything because of the bad experience he had when he was a cadet.  And then to go forward to have my, you know, to have my own little brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker] be the first African American, First Captain, you know, I, and I'd like to think I helped pave the way so that he could do that, where I was highest level that had been achieved.  Some others had done that too, couple of 'em, and then the next year, they said, hey, we can have one that can do that, you know, you know.  And, and served honorably, and you know what, there's been one other--well, there's been--there was the second one.  You know when the second one occurred?  The second, there was--the second black to become the First Captain occurred when I made him one when I was a commandant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his name is Ricardo Turner.  And that guy has excelled out in the Army.  He was selected early for major.  He's out doing great things.  He's been to combat numerous times, and just kicking out, in the Army as only--so, you know, these are great leaders that they just needed to have that same equal shot that everybody got.  And he did, and has excelled.  And now, the First Captain this past year, was a football player who is also an African American.  So now there's been three.
Story_ID: 36416
Speaker 1: Okay, so you retired in 2003.
Speaker 2: 2006.
Speaker 1: 2006, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: August 1st, 2006.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so, that's right because you took, you were the commandant at West Point [United States Military Academy] and--
Speaker 2: And then I was the Vice Director of the Army Staff--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was my last assignment.
Speaker 1: All right, well, tell us about that last assignment?
Speaker 2: That was a phenomenal experience too.  So Pete Schumacher was the chief of staff of the Army.  The director of the Army staff was a guy named Jim Campbell, Lieutenant Jim Campbell.  So as the vice director, you know, basically, I coordinated the Army staff.  So I saw all the major actions coming into the, that were going into the Secretary [of the Army] or the Chief.  I met, I spoke with a small group, like about three times a week, with the Secretary of the Army, myself.  It was what was, I'll tell you a really interesting thing about my family.  So when he would have the, me or the director, and normally, he had me, the vice director of the Army staff--this is the Secretary of the Army, he'd have his chief of Public Affairs, which was my brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker], and he had his acquisition executive and his lawyer, and his deputy.  That would be the little morning meeting group.  And so it was kind of cool that, you know, he's having his little group that meets to periodically, you know, to talk about what's going on in the Army, whatever, and two of 'em are brothers.  And another thing that I didn't mention, which was kind of interesting, you know, I talked about my experience as the aide [-de-camp] to the chief of staff of the Army.  Well, about, I was there for two years.  About a year and a half into that, the vice chief of staff, the Number Two person in the Army picked an aide, and it was my brother.  So for about six months, the, when you came into the headquarters suite of the Department of the Army, the chief and the vice chief--there was Lieutenant Colonel Brooks, and Lieutenant--and Major Brooks, you know, were the two aides to those senior leaders at the same time.  I don't think that's ever been, ever (laughter), anywhere.
Speaker 1: All right, so--
Speaker 2: And, you know, I--one of the things I worked there was Abu Ghraib, the prison scandal, which was phenomenal.  So, you know, there were about, I'd say somewhere in the order of seventeen different inspections, assessments, reports, investigations that were associated with the Abu Ghraib abuse, prisoner abuse, you know, fiasco.  And so somebody had to go through and sift through every one of the recommendations that came from all those different things.  And there was a bunch of 'em, over a--I want to say 300 and something recommendations that came out of that.  Some of 'em didn't make any sense, you know, and you weren't gonna do 'em.  Maybe it came from an organization that wasn't even military that did an assessment that just didn't have legal merit, right.  But, but you couldn't afford not to have at least looked at 'em, and done the analysis of whether or not that was gonna be U.S. policy or not in the future.  So the provost marshal of the United States Army sort of had overall responsibility for actually looking at the investigations themselves.  Then myself and the intelligence officer of the Army, which was at that time, Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, the current commander of CYBERCOM [United States Cyber Command] in the NSA [National Security Agency], we more or less had the role of, okay, me, as a tasking order that could task the Army staff and could task major commands.  And my role was to, as we got things, was to task organizations to either do research or to come in with a position or to write a policy position, based upon their, you know, whatever domain they might have oversight over.  So I got to see every single thing that all the photos that were associated with that.  I got to read every one of these reports.  I had the opportunity to brief the Secretary of Defense, Secretary [Donald] Rumsfeld on it, on two occasions, and it was really an interesting experience to be in the Army and have that kind of insight into what was going on and something that was so significant and to be trusted to kind of help pull that together.
Story_ID: 36417
Speaker 1: Yeah, did--what changed as a result?  Was it policy or practice or both?
Speaker 2: Both, so, well, one of the things that they did, there was not a clear standard for what, how all people who are combatants on a battlefield would be treated.  You know, if you were a military combatant, you had these kind of rules.  If you were not under the Geneva Convention, i.e., you were a terrorist, you had these kind of rules for interrogation.  You know, if you were CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], you could do something else, and so it--and people might see these different techniques being used different places, and it was so convoluted that it was no wonder that people made mistakes.  They might have seen something that might have been authorized in one theater, say Guantanamo, that because of the status of those people there, that wasn't authorized in Iraq, with a military combatant.  And so, in essence, what happened is, is now there is one standard.  There is, the Army has a proponent for the field manual that oversees interrogations.  And that's for all government.  That covers all organizations.  Now, there's classified appendixes to it, you know, that deal with certain things that can be done in certain circumstances that have to be authorized to be able to be done by certain groups of people.  But the premise, the general premise, basically, is everybody sort of gets treated the same, which wasn't the case before.  And so there was a big policy change.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And in practice, and just in terms of, you know, let's face it.  We weren't in a war.  We weren't used to having and maintaining a bunch of prisoners and we had people who were trying to do interrogations, that didn't have any authorization to do it.  And in some cases like an Abu Ghraib, there were, the people who abused those people, they weren't interrogating anybody to being with.  That was not an interrogation abuse.  That was just some misguided soldiers that were abusing prisoners, not interrogating them, abusing them.  But there were other cases where it was, you know, there was interrogation abuse.  Yeah, so, it's a combination.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you were vice director of the Army staff through the year--well, from 2004 to 2006?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, and anything else from that period that you wanna share with us?
Speaker 2: Just it was, I had a just, trying to think.  That was a phenomenal time to be in there.  That Abu Ghraib thing was a major thing we worked on, transitioning a new Secretary of the Army during that time was also big for me.  It was interesting to be involved in some cases where me and my brother, from two different directorates were actually having to present our arguments from different points of view, you know, about like who should have proponency over, say a particular office.  You know, as the vice director, I had a group that did some things.  He thought it should be under him.  He's presenting it to the director I'm presenting it to director why they shouldn't.  It's too many--two brothers doing that.  They stay with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 36418
Speaker 1: So now you retired from the [U.S.] Army in 2006, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, August 1st.
Speaker 1: August 1st, 2006.  Okay, now, what prompted your retirement?  Were you, I mean you could have stayed, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I surely could have stayed.  Health, okay.  My wife had health, big health issues, went through big cancer scare.  I had some health issues too which are all good now, but, so that was the main thing and just saying, you know, while I can, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go start a new career.  I've been successful at this one.  The health scare, you know, kind of made me say, okay, I'm ready to make a transition.  And I did and feeling good.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now, did you have this position lined up at Boeing when you retired?
Speaker 2: Not at all.  In fact, I wasn't even thinking about Boeing when I actually retired.  I had several companies, when they heard I was retiring, starting to talk to me.  I had offers on the table for several.  And then it was actually, probably, I actually stopped working--my retirement ceremony was May 15th.  It was probably July that Boeing started courting me.  And I really didn't think about Boeing too much because they're more, I always saw them more as an aviation-focused business.  And I'm not an aviator.  I'm an infantryman.  But what they were looking for was somebody who had a broader, grand vision of the Army and what its overall needs were and where it was trying to go and the kind of capabilities it would need in the future.  And I totally was capable of doing that.  So when they talked to me, and I, I did a couple of different things.  I did my own due diligence.  I looked at a video.  I saw the chairman, brand--at that time, he had been there for maybe a year, Jim McNerney, and it was a video.  And the video was of him talking to all of his vice presidents, right after he had taken over.  And he was talking about the importance of people.  And more than focusing on the product, his energy was going into how we grow people, how we develop our people, how do we give 'em the right tools and equipment so that they can do, you know, make the incredible products that we make.  He was talking about the leader development.  And I was going, man, this guy is talking just like, you know, as if I--like when I would have when I was the commandant [of cadets] of West Point [United States Military Academy], about how you grow, how you make a great organization.  And I was so intrigued with that, I said, man, that's where I wanna go.  So that was, that was the selling point.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and now, did they offer you more than one position or did they--
Speaker 2: No, I was specifically brought in to be the vice president of Army Systems.  So their, they were creating this, actually, I'm the first one they ever had.  They created a customer-facing organization that had three vice presidents that belonged to the CEO, the defense CEO, and an Army and Navy and an Air Force customer-facing vice president.  And I was the first Army vice president that they hired.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I did that for about two years.
Story_ID: 36419
Speaker 1: Now, did, is this, when you worked on the Block III helicopter?
Speaker 2: Primarily, back then, I was working on something called "Future Combat Systems," which was the, where the [U.S.] Army was trying to go in its major modernization effort.  I also worked on the Apache Block III and on the Chinook CH-47F.  Those were the, probably the big three things, and then some radio programs.  And so they ended up not doing the Future Combat Systems.  I didn't--it was a very expensive program, and it changed multiple times in terms of what the requirements were.  And then also, you know, where we were in terms of our pace of getting it done.  There was, you know, it was intended to provide a whole unit, and capability of fighting in the future.  And it was always designed to do that, and we were building it to do that.  But then there was a need to try to do stuff faster.  So then they wanted to take little pieces from it, right, maybe a little robot, maybe a radio, maybe something else, a sensor, and get that out faster.  And just pull those pieces.  Well, so when you started breaking it apart, and putting those pieces out in the force, some people saw that as, wait a minute.  We're spending all this money, and all we're getting is these pieces?  They weren't patient enough to wait for when it was always scheduled to get the whole system.  And so then it kind of lost its support on the Hill [Capitol], and in the Department of Defense [DoD] with the Secretary of Defense.  And then it got killed.  The Block III Apache is alive and fully funded, and today as is the CH-47F.  So those did well.
Speaker 1: I was reading a little bit about the Block III.  How's it different from the Apache?
Speaker 2: Well, so I'd say, it's like the difference between you having a car that has air conditioning and all power seats and rearview camera and a GPS [global positioning system] system and having a car where you gotta roll down windows and, you know, doesn't, and doesn't have any air conditioning or anything of that nature.  So a Block III Apache is, it's a note in the network, this thing has the ability to connect to both Air Force and ground assets.  It has the ability to control unmanned aerial vehicles itself.  So a copilot could actually, in the future, will take over and actually fly.  Let's say a UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] is flying out there and sees a bad guy.  You know, that UAV can shoot a laser and designate where that person is on the ground or that thing is on the ground.  And then that Apache--that's not even connected to it, can fire a missile and go where that laser is pointing. Or that system could actually take control of that UAV and move it to another place so the Apache is out of harm's way.  The UAV flies over the target where you want it to look at.  The UAV then lasers, you shoot a missile that can go there.  It absolutely brings fear to the enemy.  They run when they hear one coming because it's so lethal.  It's got incredible sights on it, night and day.  So it can provide excellent situation awareness to the troops on the battlefield.  And it can actually transmit data that they see down to the battlefield so they can see it or remote viewing terminals.  So you could actually see what the Apache is seeing.  So just an incredible capability that the Army really, really wants, and much more survivable than a Block I or Block II Apache, which they won't even let them deploy at that range anymore because of, it's so much more advanced, the Block III is.
Speaker 1: Now, is that the Block III over your right shoulder in the back?  We can actually see it in the shot so that's why I ask?  Is that it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that is actually, no, that's a Block II right there.
Speaker 1: That's a Block II, okay.
Speaker 2: That's a Block II picture right there.
Speaker 1: All right.  I tried to get the Block III behind you, but I didn't see one (laughter).  All we could come up with was a Block II.
Story_ID: 36420
Speaker 1: So, now, your role has changed a little bit now, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, totally changed.  So interesting story, so, about two years after I was into the job, I got a call saying chairman--I want you to, I'm having a car come to pick you up.  The chairman of the company wants to meet you and wants to talk to you.  And I said, really?  I mean un--no notice.  And so I saw him, and says they were creating a new position.  This is a new position as well.  And I want, I'm gonna create a group where we basically takes all those customer-facing people that I just described, I was, the Army, the Navy group, and added to it, it's got Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Intelligence, like the NSA [National Security Agency] and all those kind of organizations.  It's got NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], Homeland Security, and all those organizations that we deal with, takes them, puts them all together, and then puts them all under the head of government operations here to basically be the lead for advocacy for defense, NASA, Homeland Security and Intelligence organizations for the corporation.  And so I over see that organization.  So it's been a, it's been an eye-opening experience but absolutely fabulous because now I don't just think about a Block III Apache or I'm thinking about F-18 fighters.  I'm thinking about--and the capability they bring, the EATG Growler, the space launch system, the next deep space exploration rocket, the International Space Station, you know.  I'm thinking about things like that, that new Army--the Air Force tanker, the new Navy Maritime domain awareness platform, the PA, Poseidon, all these things, the C-17 transporter plane, all those are things that are in, that the Boeing defense systems, makes that I support with people who are subject matter experts, advocates that can--myself included, can go up to Capitol Hill, can go into the Pentagon, can interact with senior customers that they trust and respect because they know we are credible professionals with credentials from our past.  And we can advise the business in terms of what they ought to be thinking about in terms of strategy, in terms of how to develop new capability and new products and services, you know, to support our Department of Defense [DoD], NASA and Homeland Security customers.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what are your future plans?  I mean I know you're doing this [vice president, National Security and Space Group, Boeing Company] now, but like what do you--
Speaker 2: Well, my future (unclear), you know, as my daddy [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] taught me a long time ago, you know, do your job, do it well, and, you know, be better than every--be better and not be the same as everybody else.  So that's all I'm doing is focused on--I love my job.  I, I'm truly in a unique position because this is, this kind of role is niche in one regard, meaning you need somebody that's got the experience from the Pentagon that knows the products, that knows the customers.  And so I'm, I fit really well in this job.  And my business likes what I do.  So I, you know, and I'm at a very senior level now in the company.  I really love the leadership of the company.  I love the direction the company's going in, and I also really like the fact that it is both commercial and defense.  You know, I focus primarily on defense and national security.  But, but there's another whole half of the company that focuses on the commercial aspects.  So it's great to be part of such a big, iconic company that has such a great reputation around the world.  A lot of times it might not even be for the defense side.  It might be for the commercial aspect of a Boeing jet.  And it also is neat to participate in things like, to help with like, as we start working on international campaigns, as we work on things to sell our products around the world.  So, so I'm fully engaged, doing what I'm doing right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a chance to use your training as an engineer to, in this position?
Speaker 2: Not in the purest sense.  I tell you what it does do though, it helps me to use the engineering discipline in terms of how--critical thinking, as I am reviewing and listening to proposals and, or, solutions that we're presenting.  That critical thought, the analytical thought process that you use has helped me in this business because I'm dealing with a whole bunch of engineers.  And I know, so that's for, that's how they process, how they think.
Story_ID: 36421
Speaker 1: All right, so, now, you do quite a bit of public speaking.
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: And what's your message for--it's primarily to young people, right?
Speaker 2: I do a lot of speaking to young people.  I talk to other organizations too, but, you know, I'm really focused on the fact of, I go back to my roots and really to go back beyond that, I go to my parents' roots.  So when people say you can't make it.  The environment's stacked against you, there's, you don't have a chance.  Yes, you do.  You do have a chance.  You gotta decide for yourself whether you're gonna reach out, grab the brass ring, make yourself a better person or you're not.  And you need to know that there are so many people that wanna root for you, that wanna help you, that you don't have to succumb to all the peer pressure that may be around you.  You can stand strong.  You need to seek support where there are people that wanna help you, you know, grow and have opportunity.  Don't be satisfied with just being average.  Focus on being better.  Don't be as good, be better.  And opportunity will come to you if you do that.  You're not gonna be the CEO in a week.  You're not gonna be Michael Jordan in a week.  You focus on fundamentals and staying morally straight.  And generally, when people do that, and they stay focused, I'd rather have the old saying, you know, I'd rather have a lion leading lambs than to have a lamb leading lions.  You know, so it's that aspect of strong leadership, okay, helping encourage people.  The other thing I like to focus on is leader development.  And I'll focus on the fact of, you know, I've had many positive influences in my life, and they were all people that gave me more energy than they took.  They inspired me to want to be better.  They weren't like my coach Buddy, when I was in fifth grade, who told me I'd never be able to meet, amount to anything in sports.  And, boy, was he wrong, you know.  There was the coach, the coaches that, you know, that inspired me to do, that if I just did this little bit more, I could do better or they'd focus on some aspect of what I was doing to help me grow better.  I got that in the military.  I got that at home, and I think being that positive influence, giving energy--not just a cheerleader, 'cause a cheerleader doesn't add value other than make you feel good for a minute.  But if you wanna feel good, if you wanna really change somebody, you know, gotta really show 'em that you care about 'em, and you gotta have that kind of emotion and passion that makes a difference in their life.  And you have to give 'em constructive ways of how to do it.  You gotta invest yourself if you're gonna help somebody in making sure they know you're committed to help 'em do it.  So that's what I like to talk to people about, when they're mentoring people or if they're trying to be, trying to develop their own leadership skills or if I'm talking to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36422
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done in life so far, is there anything major that you would go back and change or do differently, if you could?
Speaker 2: That's a great question.  That is a great question.  I don't believe so.  I, I'm certainly glad I chose to join the United States Army.  I'm certainly glad that I chose my path to go to West Point [Unites States Military Academy] to meet that, meet that goal, meet that opportunity of serving in the U.S. Army.  I'm so totally thankful that I was an infantryman, and that I served on the point of the spear, the vast majority of my career in tough, hard combat units.  And I am, I value that I'm, I have a bond with those people that I served with.  And I'm very thankful for my four daughters that I have now--I actually have now a son-in-law that actually graduated from West Point in 2009, and now I have granddaughter from that son-in-law and my third daughter.  And who knows, maybe I'll have another generation at West Point coming up after that.  In fact, his father went to West Point too.  So, nah, I'm very thankful for my children.  I'm thankful for the parents [Naomi Lewis Brooks and Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] and the upbringing that I had.  There's not a whole lot I'd change.  I've had a good life.
Story_ID: 36423
Speaker 1: Speaking of your children, now, tell us a little bit about your children.  You have four daughters, right?
Speaker 2: Four daughters.  My oldest daughter, Bethany, it's funny as I look at them, none of them chose the path of going into the military.  But my oldest daughter, Bethany, is a physical education teacher, graduated from the University of North Carolina in, I guess, 2005.  And then she became a teacher here in Northern Virginia, teaching elementary physical education.  Then she went back and got her master's degree in kinesiology and, from the University of Georgia.  And so, now she's happily married, got married in, I guess November of last year.  And so, we're proud of her.  She's about thirty years old.  And then my Number Two daughter, Loren [ph.], is a math high school teacher in Raleigh, North Carolina and just got married this past July--this past June and incredibly accomplished, went to North Carolina as well, graduated in 2006, got a master's degree in math education from Wake Forest University and was named 'Teacher of the Year' for Wake County, which is one of the largest counties in the nation in North Carolina, as a math teacher, so very, real proud of her.  Matter of fact, as we speak, as a result of her Teacher of the Year accomplishment, she is now on some kind of exchange for like the summer in India, right now, as we speak, married to a wonderful young man named Andrew.  And my daughter, Bethany, is married to a wonderful young man named Chris.  And then my Number Three daughter, Amanda, graduated 2009 from the University of Greensboro.  She's a deaf education major.  She signs.  And she married her high school sweetheart, who ended up going to West Point [United States Military Academy], and she graduated like around the 15th of May.  He graduated about the 25th of May, and they get married on the 26th of May.  That was a, talk about putting stress on your old dad's heart, that did it, and all that kind of stuff.  And now they have, have given me a beautiful granddaughter, Hannah Rose Berlin, and so--and my son-in-law, I'll tell you how ironic this is, is so Amanda was born when I was in the First Ranger Battalion in Savannah, Georgia.  My daughter-in-law--my daughter was born there in Savannah, Georgia when I was in the First Ranger Battalion.  My son-in-law is now in First Ranger Battalion, the same Ranger Battalion I was in when I was a captain, you know, twenty-six years ago.  And they have a granddaughter--have a daughter, Hannah Rose.  She's, she turned one in July.  So she's one year and a month.  And then my youngest daughter, Rachel, Rachel Diane.  She went to Wheaton College near Chicago [Illinois], Wheaton, Illinois.  And Rachel's my "save the world, Mother Theresa" daughter, just beautiful soul, beautiful spirit.  Rachel graduated and started out working for, doing an internship where she was working, helping undocumented aliens, okay, from other countries, primarily Hispanics--she's fluent in Spanish, you know, deal with living in the United States and trying to help them get medical care--[phone rings].
Story_ID: 36424
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about your youngest daughter.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so my daughter, Amanda, who graduated from Wheaton [College], went on a six-month semester abroad to Peru, Lima, Peru, came back fluent in Spanish.  She was already really good in Spanish, came back fluent in Spanish.  She, while she was there, she was working for an organization called Paz E-Esperanza [ph.], and basically, it was, down there, it was helping primarily women, battered women and things of that nature, with civil rights and things of that nature down there, in Peru.  She came back from that with this passion for wanting to help disadvantaged people.  So when she graduated, she took an internship with an organization that's really sort of part of AmeriCorps, that was helping undocumented aliens get healthcare and integrate into society.  And so she's doing, she just finished that, and now, she's just taken over a new job doing something similar in terms of the social work and support of, you know, immigrants that are in the Chicago [Illinois], greater Chicago area and having a great time with that, real proud of her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36425
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  When you look back on everything you've done again to this point, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that I am known as a person that was a positive role model, leader, that I, I'm real proud of the fact that I look around and I see a lot of the people who came up underneath me that are now rising up into positions of significance in the military.  I, I like to think that I had some kind of contribution to that, in terms of that.  And so just as a, being known as a person who was a solid professional leader, that cared about people, that knew how to develop and train organizations and people, that could be put in really tough situations, and could deal with it in a calm, professional, courageous way.  That's what I want, that's what I hope is my legacy, that people look back when they look at me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36426
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we haven't discussed we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't think, although I'd say, you know, I've spent a, I'm very blessed to be part of this family.  I didn't talk a lot about my sister [Marquita Karen Brooks] or my mom [Naomi Lewis Brooks] very much, but just the fact of, to have a family that is, the importance of family and support.  We talked a little bit about this earlier.  My brother [Vincent Brooks; also a HistoryMaker], I think mentioned it in his interview, the importance of family.  Now, while everybody doesn't have, might not have a biological family, everybody can have a support network that, and can, that can help with wholesome, healthy focused support to help somebody, you know, and not by just giving 'em everything, but be there to support them as they're trying to achieve their goals in life.  That has been a real important thing in my life, my family.  My sister, my mother, my dad [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker], my brother, his wife, and you know, my children.  It's just, I'm so, so thankful to have had that support, and all my extended family, my cousins and aunts and uncles.  When somebody's in need, they rally, you know.  And I'm very thankful to have that 'cause I know a lot of people don't.  The other thing is the importance of God in my life.  You know, our family's blessed that you're doing this, these interviews because we've been able to achieve something.  But we all know, all three of us know that, you know--and I'm sure every one of them said the same thing, you know, that, it's not because of them.  You know, there is a purpose, there's a reason why God's chosen to give us this opportunity.  And so I first recognize that that's where it all starts, not with me, but with Him.  And I'm very thankful for that too.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 36427
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I guess I almost sort of said that, didn't I?  So, as somebody that was passionate, compassionate, dependable, trustworthy, reliable, committed, dedicated and loving.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  All right, I appreciate it.
Story_ID: 36428
Speaker 1: So the picture you're looking at right here is my command photo as the Commandant of Cadets at the United States Military Academy [West Point].  So you can see the West Point colors, Commandant Cadet colors in the back, in the gray, next to the American flag, and my general officer uniform.
Speaker 2: About what year is that?
Speaker 1: That is 2002, summer of 2002.
Speaker 2: And this picture here is a picture of me standing next to my Command Sergeant Major, Gary Calanosky (ph.) when I'm the commander of the 1st Brigade at the 82nd.  And we're out at a site in Kosovo when we were over there, one of our battalions that was in Kosovo at a monastery up on a hill.  That was about 1999.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably some winter.
Speaker 1: This picture is of the Board of Directors for a nonprofit organization called "D.C. College Access Program" that supports--provides scholarships to [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] high school youth for college.  And it also provides mentorship opportunities for them.  And I'm on the board as chair, but Don Graham, the chairman of 'The Washington Post' in the center and the lady in red is the vice president's [Joe Biden] wife, [Jill] Biden, Dr. [Jill] Biden.  And that was taken probably around May of 2011.
Speaker 2: In my role as Vice President of National Security Space Group, I had the honor of hosting an event with Senator John Glenn because of his role as an astronaut.  Also, with him is Astronaut--
Speaker 1: Deek (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, Scott Carpenter, okay, who by the way, not only was one of the first people to orbit the earth, but he's also, was like, has one of the records for deep sea exploration in terms of being, going to the deepest place that a human's gone in, in the sea also in a Navy vessel.  And then the fellow on the far right in that picture is Jack Daley, a lieutenant general, retired, U.S. Marine Corps, who runs the Smithsonian.
Speaker 1: This was taken when I was the Commandant of Cadets in probably 2004, early 2004, Spring.  And that is Gordon R. Sullivan, the 32nd Chief of Staff of the Army.  And he is receiving the prestigious Silvanis Thayer Award, and I had the honor of being the host for that ceremony at West Point when I as a Commandant.  And we're trooping the line in a jeep. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSON):
Speaker 2: This great picture, two pictures is when I was a commander of A Company, First Battalion, 75th Infantry Ranger, when I was in the Ranger Regiment in Savannah, Georgia.  And the top picture is me being presented a plaque for having the best company in the 75th Ranger Regiment, Alpha Company, 175, and it's being presented by the Regimental Commander.  That is, at the time, Colonel Wesley B. Taylor, and at the bottom is a picture of all the company commanders of the seventy--of First Ranger Battalion.  And we were about to get a tour battle streamer from Grenada, from then Secretary of the Army, John O. Marsh, in the blue suit.  And that was probably Summer of 1987.
Speaker 1: I'm a great lover of rugby, played rugby all, pretty much all my life since I entered West Point or since my sophomore year at West Point.  And in the Spring of every year, all the alumni Rugby players come back to West Point to play in a match against the graduating seniors of the West Point Rugby team.  The West Point seniors are wearing the gray uniforms.  And all the old alumni who came to play are in the yellow and black and yellow.  And it's called, that, our team is actually called "Old Gray," and this playing that alumni versus seniors match, when I am the Commandant of West Point in the spring of 2004.
Speaker 2: Back in the Reagan [President Ronald Reagan] era, you may recall, we were at a significant tension with the Nicaraguans with the Sandinistas and so the ranger battalions were being sent down there to border to basically train, live fire along the border and do operations along the border.  This is a picture of the First Ranger Battalion commanders and staff during that deployment, and that is about--I am the Commander A-Company, 175.  That is about 1987, and that is on the, vicinity of the border of Nicaragua in Honduras, and from left to right, you have me, A-Company Commander, Dave Morehouse, B-Company Commander, next to me.  The third guy over with glasses, Steve Fondacarrol (ph.) who was the C-Company commander.  The next guy to him, the Major, is Jim Dubick.  He ended up retiring as a Lieutenant General who's the XO, the assistant S-3 was Captain Mick Betenarick (ph.).  In the middle there, who is now a serving three-star General, the guy next to him is Major Earl Atkinson, who was the operations officer of the battalion, came in late.  It was, that time, he came in, he was the third African American in the--officer in the regiment when I came in.  The guy next to him was our doc, and the guy next to him, Doc Mellon, and the guy next to him is our support officer.  And the people in the front, the guy with his hands behind his back in the very front is the battalion commander, Keith M. Nightingale (ph.).
Speaker 1: This is my father [Leo Brooks, Sr.; also a HistoryMaker] in the white who is giving me my commissioning oath when I was a regimental commander at West Point on June 6, 1979.  I wore those same whites in my career as a general officer in the military, the same ones he's wearing right there, I wore.
Speaker 2: You all about the same size.
Speaker 1: Didn't even have to change the name.
Speaker 2: That's right.  It was easy money.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of the First Brigade of the 82nd staff, and every year in May we have something called All American Week, which is a week of activities to commemorate the history of the 82nd Airborne Division.  And my brigade was, happened to be passing in review in the parade, and someone took this picture.  And what's interesting about that picture is that that picture, unknown to me, ended up becoming a poster, AUSA, Association United States Army poster that, with that whole staff in the center of it later.  That was done in probably May of 1999.
Speaker 2: I can see that being on a poster.
Speaker 1: Yeah, looks like a Hollywood (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was actually a rehearsal.  It wasn't even the main event, but, yeah.  I love that picture.
Speaker 1: Okay, is that it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and now, do I--should I do like if I wanted--
Speaker 1: This is my daughter, Rachel Diane Brooks.  This is her high school graduation picture.  This would have been in 2008.
Speaker 2: This is my daughter, Amanda Brooks Berlin, married to my son-in-law, Joseph Berlin, and this is a glam shot, I think when she was in college.  And that she's the mother of my granddaughter, Hannah Rose Berlin.
Speaker 1: This is the college graduation picture of my oldest daughter, Bethany.  She graduated from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Tar Heels, in 2005.  And that's her graduation photo.
Speaker 2: Which one did I not show?
Speaker 1: You haven't done that one over there.
Speaker 2: And this is my daughter, Lauren Brooks Baucom who got married in--that's right, I forgot about Bethany, her name is now Bethany Brooks Sink, married to my son-in-law, Chris.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-I-N-K.  Not this one, the one from--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And so Chris Sink is my son-in-law, and Bethany--
Speaker 1: Now, this is Lauren Brooks Baucom, B-A-U-C-O-M, okay, and she just got married in June to my wonderful son-in-law, Andrew Baucom.  They live in North Carolina.  And that's taken when she was a teacher, probably about 2008.
