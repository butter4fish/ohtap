Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Tim Reid, T-I-M, R-E-I-D.  And I now have to say senior 'cause my son [Timothy Reid II] is forty-some years old (laughter), but just Tim Reid, I guess for now.
Speaker 1: So it's not Timothy or--
Speaker 2: Well, it's, my full name is, but my, my--I've been known as Tim Reid as an actor for the last forty years.  But Timothy Lee Reid is my full name--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --one of them anyway.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth, December 19th, 1944, Norfolk, Virginia, colored town.
Speaker 1: And, sir, what is your occupation?

Speaker 1: Okay, and, sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  Today's date I think is February 9th, 2012.  Man, time is flying.  You know when you get older, I think a year now is in six months (laughter).

Speaker 2: We're at New Millennium Studios in my recording room, and my studio, recording studio which is on the property.
Speaker 1: Okay, here in Petersburg, right?

Story_ID: 291339
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we have to ask them of you, too.  They only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Gotcha, good luck (laughter).
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Anything Italian is my favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Color?  I'm more into earth tones, I think, but I love yellow and royal blue--well, yellow.  Those are my, I guess those are the colors that seem to brighten my spirit.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Spring seems to be my most favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Florence, Italy.  I spend as much time in Florence and have been going there since the early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I guess my favorite saying or what I've said most of my life, is be careful what you ask for, you might get it.
Story_ID: 291340
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [William Reid] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side first, not to get them mixed up.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Augustine Wilkins.  Everybody knew her as Tina.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Augustine, A-U-G-U-S-T-I-N-E, Wilkins, W-I-L-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was November 6, 1922.
Speaker 1: And where?
Speaker 2: She was born in--you know, that's a good question, Norfolk [Virginia], I believe she was also born in Norfolk.  And I say that because my mother was given away at birth.
Speaker 1: Okay, Norfolk, Virginia.  Now, well, then this may be a challenge, what do you know about your mother's ancestors?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, as you know, any one from the South back in the day, it's very hard and very difficult to trace because of the extended family concept.  But my mother was given away at birth because she was, well, to put it quite frankly, she was--there was some question as to who her father was.  My mother was very fair and born into a family that were embarrassed by the fact that she didn't look like anyone else in the family.  So they gave her up at birth, and she lived with a family in Norfolk, the Morrens [ph.].  And they raised her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But most of the family that I've come to find years after were from Eastern Shore, Maryland, oyster shuckers, and that was where her roots are.  And we've been tracing 'em ever since.  Some lead to Cape Verde, Africa.  Some lead to all over the place, but don't know much about my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, they're from--I mean you just gave us a lot of different place, locales.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're still tracing that--
Speaker 2: Still tracing.  I've met some members.  It was in a strange relationship, so, you know, my mother was hurt by it most of her life 'til she passed.  But she had a very difficult life.
Story_ID: 291341
Speaker 1: So what did she [Reid's mother, Augustine Wilkins] say about growing up?  How did she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother grew up, again, in a very painful situation.  She was, because she was very fair, she could actually pass.  She was ridiculed by other kids and she was about twenty-one when I was born during the war [World War II, WWII].  After giving birth to me, I'm almost sure had there been liberalization of birth control and things at this time then, I wouldn't be here.  But she did have me, and my father [William Reid], who I later found out was my father.  I didn't know who he was.  I thought he was my uncle for many years.  I was a bastard child.  And it was very difficult for her.  And she had to give me up when I was nine.  And then from that point on, she lived, she worked as a domestic, living in homes of wealthy white families in New York until I graduated from [Crestwood] High School [Chesapeake, Virginia].  So, she didn't have a very wonderful life until I was able to provide for her when I graduated from college [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] and took care of her the rest of her life.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did she have a chance to go to school and finish high school?
Speaker 2: My mother dropped out of school in ninth grade.  I'm the only member of my family to ever graduate from high school, let alone college.  My father dropped out of school in the sixth grade.  No, he went, I'm sorry--yeah, he did.  I don't think he finished, he finished elementary school.  But he never went to high school, had to work in the fields.  My grandmother [Beulah Reid] had my father when she was thirteen.  So it's not a family known for its educational values.  It was a hardworking family, rural country on my father's side.  So me going to school and going to college was a big thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories that your mother passed down to you that are, you know, historical or you think are worth telling?
Speaker 2: No my mother, my mother didn't really pass on 'cause she, she was very tight-lipped about--you know, black families back in those days were not as, we didn't tweet, we didn't have--we didn't tweet.  We didn't have Facebook so black families were very, very insulatory in terms of their stories.  They didn't talk a lot about their past 'cause most of it was very painful, especially for those of us in the South who lived in segregation and most of their adult life.  It wasn't a lot of wonderful stories to talk about in the low income end of the family which I grew up--I mean of the community which I grew up in.  It was struggle.  They were not the good ole days.  So my mother was born in struggle, struggled to survive and was alone most of her life.  So she didn't talk much about her family.  Again, a bitter beginning for her.  The latter years, she had probably more fun.  But I would have to say my--looking back on it now, my mother was bipolar and I understood why.  So the stories were not very, it was more living in the present for her than the past.
Story_ID: 291342
Speaker 1: I got most of the stories from my grandmother [Beulah Reid] who raised me on my father's side.  Now, on that side, my God, there were stories galore.
Speaker 2: Now, let's go to that side then.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 1: Father's full name was William Lee Reid, and hardworking man.
Speaker 2: What was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: You know, I knew you were gonna ask me that.  I think July 13, 1916, I believe.
Speaker 2: Okay, and was he born in Norfolk [Virginia], too?
Speaker 1: No, he was born in a little place called Whaleyville, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Whaleyville, how do you spell that?
Speaker 1: Now, that's a good one, Whale, lee ville (laughter), W-H-A-L-E-L-L-, Whaleyville, V-I-L-L-I-E [sic.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I did an approximation.  We'll see what--
Speaker 1: Yeah, see what it comes out with.  I, you know, I never even thought about how to spell that.
Speaker 2: So, was he raised in Whaleyville?
Speaker 1: He was, he was raised on a sharecropper's farm.  My, his grandfather was born and died on the property that his father, his grandfather was a slave on.  They came from sharecroppers and when emancipation happened, as you know, a lot of families had never even been more than a few miles from where they were born or enslaved.  And so they, particularly, they decided, not being an educated group, to stay on the land and work as sharecroppers, the new form of slavery.  And so they were sharecroppers up until my great-grandfather passed away.  He was a sharecropper, and literally, the day he passed away, word got back to the owners of the land.  And they came probably a few days later and had everybody move off the property, that their contract had been broken, contract between his father's father about they could stay on the land.  This little small--I don't think it was more than an acre that my family was on for the whole.  And he raised eleven children, and they were, they were Vanns [ph.], my grandmother was a Vann, and my father became a Reid, of course, based on his father.  But he never really knew.  And so, but so the Vanns are that family of the bloodline that goes back to slavery were Vanns.  And they were quite (laughter), quite well known in the area, very notorious.  It was the eleven brothers--I mean nine brothers and two sisters.  And believe me, history still talks about the Vanns.
Speaker 2: Now, the only other Vann I've heard about is Robert [Lee] Vann who owned the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], but--
Speaker 1: Who knows?
Speaker 2: --I don't know where he's from.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he may trace it down to Virginia, North Carolina border.
Story_ID: 291343
Speaker 1: But the Vanns [ph.] were--and still are stories about them, quite unique (laughter).
Speaker 2: Can you tell us one?  Is there a particular (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I mean one of my favorite stories about my uncles, my great uncles, I should call them, who were very instrumental in my upbringing, very powerful, very serious men.  I mean they ruled.  And they went into various areas.  One of my great uncles became a numbers runner and was quite successful, owned a boarding house and gave it to my--his sister, my [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid].  She owned a huge boarding house and she sold whiskey illegally as well as running the numbers.  And then my other uncle, there was this guy that I would hear about as a kid.  His name was Uncle Rufus [ph.].  I mean that's what I called him Uncle Rufus.  His name was Rufus.  And what Rufus' claim to fame was, as a little kid, nine years old, ten years, I'd hear the stories of Rufus, Uncle Rufus.  Well, he was in prison here in the state penitentiary [Virginia Penitentiary] in Richmond [Virginia].  He had killed a man; forgot what the disagreement was, but he had literally kicked him to death.  And he was notorious.  He was the enforcer of the family.  And I'd heard about this man.  His legend had been such that as a little kid growing up, you know, when everything was good, they would say, "Well, you know, when Rufus got into it," and you'd hear "Rufus, Rufus."  And I mean this image of this man and his power was part of psychology for many years.  Well, many years later, I'm now grown.  I have my own children.  I'm taking care of one of my great uncles who, who was paralyzed on one side and had--from a fight that he had gotten into; man hit him in the head with a jackhammer and paralyzed.  I actually was there when that happened when I was about thirteen.  But anyway, I'm taking care of him, and I go back to see him, and I take my children to see my Uncle Joe [ph.] who was a wonderful man, player, but he was a wonderful man, taught me to dress, told me wonderful stories.  So I'm sitting in the room, has been sending him clothes and I'd send him money.  So I was back visiting, and I had my kids.  I said, we're going--it's his birthday, we're going to Uncle Joe and celebrate his birthday.  So my kids, my daughter [Tori Reid] and my son [Timothy Reid II] and my first wife [Rita Reid] and I went.  And we took him a cake.  And he had never had a birthday party with a cake, and he's an old man now.  He'd never had a cake, and he was crying and I was crying.  And I noticed a gentleman sitting over in a corner.  I mean I'd seen him before, but he was quiet.  And he had on a sweater that I had given my Uncle Joe.  And I'm looking at this, and I'm getting angry.  I'm going, this man is probably taking my Uncle Joe's clothes.  And I'm looking at him, I'm trying to give him a hard look.  And this man gave me nothing.  I could look in his eyes, and growing up in the streets, you learn a lot about danger.  And I could look at this man's eyes and see that he was not to be fooled with, never said a word.  But, and I knew not to go too far with him.  I kept trying to give him a look, and I asked Uncle Joe is everything.  He said, "Oh, yeah, everything's fine."  I said, "Is he"--he said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, he's fine."  So I started to leave 'cause I had to go catch a flight, and as I walked, I got down the hall.  I went wait a minute.  I walked back in.  I said, "Excuse me, sir, but are you Uncle Rufus?"  He said yes.  He had just been released from prison.  He had been there for over twenty-five years.  And he had come back and spent with my Uncle Joe.  And I sat down, and I just sat down and I wept.  I said, "I've heard about you all my life, sir."  And we chatted, and, of course he was--he was stiff, but he was in great shape for a guy to be that old, he was, I mean--I was sitting there and I'm looking at him.  Those guys in prison who survive, they're very healthy (laughter).  So we talked for a few minutes.  I said, "I gotta go catch a plane, sir, but I'd certainly like to keep in touch with you."  And he, you know, he's soft spoken 'cause he had, you know, he didn't have a lot to say.  And I shook his hand, and I left.  And my Uncle Joe died before I got back, and I never heard from him again.  But I had heard about him all my life, this Uncle Rufus, Uncle Rufus.  And he had done, I mean the tragedy of the murder, but he had done--he was the enforcer of the family.  When anything went round, went down or needed to be taken care of, Uncle Rufus was the man who would do it.  And he did some things that were--that was great for the community.  He also did some bad things.  But he was a very serious character.
Story_ID: 291344
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Vanns [ph.] were involved with, you said the numbers?  They had a boarding house (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Numbers, illegal whiskey and successful businessmen, too.  One of them moved to Pennsylvania, I mean Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], was a very successful businessman.  The Vanns were, they were a different kind of black people in the area of Whaleyville [Virginia] and Suffolk [Virginia].  I mean many of them left the fields and went out and made their way.  They stayed close as a family.  I have some cousins directly through those family--those are the only people I actually stay--when I say, family, I think of the Vanns.  When I tell my kids [Tori Reid and Timothy Reid II] about their history, you know, I talk about the blood of the Vanns as opposed to the Reids or opposed to my mother's [Augustine Wilkins] side of the family.  Don't know much about them other than my great uncles, and they were a unique bunch.  They were a tribe that survived.  They had a lot of respect for their father who was a very hard man.  I met him, very tough, very serious man.  They used to send me to the country--I call it the country, Whaleyville.  On summers, my [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid] would make me go down there, and I hated 'cause of my--all of her sisters who lived on the property with their father, all of her sisters' children were all girls.  They had four girls.  And they would terrorize me.  And they had an outdoor toilet and a mule, and I'm going, "Don't send me down there," and every summer they'd have to send me down there for a week or two weeks.  And I would go and they would humiliate me.  I would get in the bed at night 'cause I had to sleep in the room with all them sisters.  I mean we're all in the same room, two bed, three, we're all sleeping together.  And they would tell me stories about ghosts and haints, and I'd go to the outdoor toilet.  I stayed constipated 'cause I didn't wanna go in the outdoor toilet (laughter).  I'd go out there, and they would say, "Snake, snake," and they would chase me and run me.  They just terrorized me for two--I'd come back.  I'd be sick.  I'd be constipated.  I'd have mosquito bites.  I hated that most of my childhood (laughter).  But they would send me to the country, mules and snakes and all kinds of things.  And--
Speaker 1: Did the Vanns have a big place there?
Speaker 2: No, it was this sharecropping.
Speaker 1: Sharecropping.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sharecropping.  It was a big house.  I mean everything was built.  They built their own house.  They built everything.  They worked the land very hard, peanut farmers at that time 'cause you know Suffolk was the home of Planters Peanuts.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, you know, it was a hard life.  It was a hard life for them.
Story_ID: 291345
Speaker 1: They all grew up.  My Aunt Dora [ph.], I think one of the reasons I'm in show business is because of my relationship with that part of my family because I became the storyteller.  And when those things would happen to me, I would come back home to my [paternal] grandmother's [Beulah Reid] house.  And she said, "How did it go?"  And I would tell these stories about what they did to me, and, of course, I would exaggerate.  So, you know, the snake which was about the size of, you know, eighteen inches, was always a python, you know, (laughter) everything was exaggerated.  And my grandmother would just laugh.  And then my Aunt Dora would come to visit, and she would ask me to tell stories about what was going on there.  So I became the storyteller.  And I became very good at it because I was, I was--I would exaggerate and I would act out the scenes, and I think it started in my grandmother's living room, talking about what happened to me down in the country with these country yokels.  And then they would come and visit me and, and ask me to tell stories about the city slickers and I became the storyteller.  And I remember, I remember the first time I made my Aunt Dora laugh so hard that she cried, and I was telling her about, I was in high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia] at the time, and I ran in the Penn Relays [Penn Relay Carnival], the 69th Penn Relays on the track team.  I was on the track team.  And we (laughter), we should have won that event, but we had a few missteps to say the least.  And I would reenact the race and, and tell the stories of how, what happened to me, and they just would--and from that point on until I didn't see her anymore, any time I'd get together, she would say--she called me Junior, "Junior, tell that story about when you ran in the thing up in that thing."  And they'd heard it I don't know how many times, but each time, they would laugh and cry and laugh and cry.  And I think that's the reason I became a storyteller.
Story_ID: 291347
Speaker 1: Now you were raised by your [paternal] grandmother, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Raised by my grandmother.
Speaker 1: What was your--give us your grandmother's full name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Beulah Reid.
Speaker 1: That's B-E-U-L-A-H.
Speaker 2: B-A-L-U-H [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Beulah Reid?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Beulah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and she had been a Vann [ph.].
Speaker 2: She definitely had been a Vann until she, she married my father's [William Reid] father, but they didn't stay together long.  She had him at thirteen, and then I think he took off, moved them to Washington [D.C.] I think by the time my father was two or three--no, actually, my Uncle Johnnie [ph.], about five, six.
Speaker 1: Now, when was your grandmother born?  What was her date of birth?
Speaker 2: That's a good one.  I don't know when my grandmother was born.
Speaker 1: I thinking--
Speaker 2: Yeah. That is a good question.
Speaker 1: About 1900 or so?
Speaker 2: About 19--probably 1904, 1905, 1906, something like that.  I got to go back.  Let's my father is '16 [1916], and he was--she was thirteen when she had him, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We'll do the math (laughter).
Speaker 1: And she was born in Whaleyville [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Whaleyville, Virginia, on the farm.  All of us, including myself were born in the house.  I was born in the house by a midwife.  None of my, none of my--I think I probably was the last one born in, born in the house.  But they were born on the farm.  I was born in the house in Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: And you were saying before that you were one of the first to graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Only one in my direct line of the family to ever graduate from high school or college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well or if you don't get to high school, you don't get to college (laughter), but let's say both.
Story_ID: 291349
Speaker 1: You thought your father [William Reid] was your uncle for a (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, see, again, I was--I've had a lot of names, but you gotta remember, I'm writing now about that part of my life.  I was born, I was a war baby, you know, a lot of people think I'm a baby boomer.  But I'm a little older than a baby boomer.  I'm what--you don't hear that term much now, but those of us who were born during World War II [WWII] were known as war babies.  And I contend, and I would like to sit down with some psychologist, some people in the historians or anthropologist or whoever it is, and see if I'm right, but I think there were more bastard children during World War II in this country than the history of this country.  I know everybody says it now, but you gotta remember, women were running America at that time.  All the men were overseas.  They were building the planes.  I mean more women have, women have more flying hours in [Boeing] B-52 [Stratofortress] bombers than men.  They built the planes, they played baseball.  They, they ran this country.  They were in the factories, Rosie the Riveter and all those.  So you gotta remember that all these women were around.  And the few men who were not able to go in the [U.S.] Army, either too old or physically for whatever reason were not involved, they were the players.  And my father, although he was in the [U.S.] Navy was--he played in the Negro Leagues Baseball.  He was a left hander, and he was a very good pitcher.  So when he got drafted--he joined the Navy rather.  He went down.  They took him to Florida to send him overseas, and (laughter) the Florida unit had one of the best baseball teams, and they would always win the championship.  And they needed--they didn't have a left hand pitcher.  So when it was time for him to be sent, shipped overseas, the base guy says, "Wait a minute, we got a game coming, we got the championship thing coming up and this is a left hander.  We're not sending him.  He's staying here," (laughter).  So my father literally stayed in Florida for most of the war pitching.  And when, and therefore, he was given leave a lot.  So he was hanging around, he and a few other men, and met my mother [Augustine Wilkins].  And he was a player, and I was born.  Now, he was married at the time that I was born to someone else, of course.  And so they kept that quiet.  And the gentleman whose name I took, who I've never seen, never met, his name was Timothy Isabel, and I was known as Timothy, on my birth certificate it was Timothy Isabel, Jr.  That's why I was called Junior.  And this man for many years, until I was probably sixteen, probably thought that I was his child 'cause he used to send a little check.  And I thought I was his child until I, at nine years old, my mother, her second husband [George Bright]--I was then called George Bright, Jr.  He was a heroin addict, and he was a very violent man, attacked my mother once and almost killed her.  And she had to get, she had to give me up 'cause she couldn't--we were living in Baltimore [Maryland].  So she called my [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid] to say, "I gotta save this kid.  I'm gonna lose him 'cause this is too dangerous for him."  So they came to get me, and along came my uncle, William Lee.  And I remember to this day my grandmother sat on the bed, and she says, "We're gonna take you back with us.  You're gonna live with us."  And she said, "But I got something to tell you.  Your uncle, William Lee, is your father."  I was delighted 'cause I loved my Uncle William Lee.  He was a wonderful man, I thought.
Story_ID: 291351
Speaker 1: I went back to live with my [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid].  I couldn't understand why I couldn't live with my father [William Reid] until I realized he was, he had a wife and--so anyway, that's how I found out, and we became friends.  And then finally about three years later, I got in some trouble, and they were gonna send me to reform school, and I needed some--my grandmother--I love her dearly.  She was, she was a wild spirit.  I mean I used, I used to say when that song came out 'Bette Davis Eyes,' that was my grandmother.  My grandmother was a tough, tough woman.  She didn't take anything, you know.  She would--if a boarder was late on the rent and he gave her a lot of, a lot of flack, she'd knock him out (laughter).  My grandmother was tough.  She didn't take anything from anybody, ran a tough boarding house, sold whiskey illegally and religious woman but serious.  And she kind of let me run wild.  She, she believed--she was a wild spirit and she let me have one of these wild spirits.  She kept me in her field of control, but that left a lot of leeway on the other side.  So I got in with the wrong crowd at that time and got into some trouble.  And they were gonna send me to reform school.  So my father who was pretty strong in the community, he came and--
Speaker 2: Now, is this in Norfolk [Virginia] or--
Speaker 1: This is in Norfolk, yeah, colored town.  I mean it was segregation.  I didn't speak socially to a white person 'til I was in the Civil Rights Movement in college [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] my freshman year.
Speaker 2: Now, is this the incident about the window being broken out or--
Speaker 1: No, no, this was the incident, we broke into a school.  This was, this was serious thievery (laughter).  And the neighbors turned us in 'cause you know, back in the day, the neighbors didn't take any stuff like that.
Speaker 2: How old were you then?
Speaker 1: I was twelve going on thirteen, I think, and--elementary school.  And so they were considering sending me to reform school.  They, you know, most of the kids that I ran around in those days, I said it was about eleven of us, and I can say right now that I only know--well, I did know, I don't know if he's still alive, only one of us, two of us were alive--well, three, but he's destined to die in prison 'cause he was sentenced to, I think, almost life in prison.  But all the rest of them were killed before I left Norfolk in violent deaths or whatever.  But when it came my time to be determined whether I was gonna go to reform school, my father came in my life and he, and because he was well respected in the community and the church, they gave him rights to me in terms of, you know, he could decide.  So he legally adopted me and on my birth certificate, you'll see a line through Isabel, and you'll see Lee Reid on the top.  And that was the day and the year that I legally became his son.
Story_ID: 296818
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm gonna back track a little bit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --to kind of put it in some kind of chronological perspective.  But one question we always ask, is when you consider your parents' [Augustine Wilkins and William Reid] personalities, and their dispositions, their talents, their looks even, and I would include your [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid] in this since she had a part in raising you, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: You know, as I look back I think I am a composite of, of a third, a third, a third.  And depending how I feel that day is which third rules.  My grandmother was sort of passion, complete passion, uncontrollable raw, as we say in Brazil, pasion crua [ph.], raw passion.  She taught me, and from her I acquired the taste for survival, for living, to the extent of life.  I mean she, she, she was unafraid, and didn't let anything or anyone get in her way, volatile, had a temper, you know, and I have tried to control that part of my life as much as possible.  My father was a man of character and despite the fact that he fathered me and a few other kids, he was a, he was a man of character.  My father was someone who word--whose word was his bond.  If he told you something, good or bad, you could count on it.  It was gonna happen; very quiet, introspective, introverted, very, very well-respected, had charisma, women adored him, adored him.  I adored him.  There were times when we did not understand each other, but I will always respect the fact that at a time when I needed to be saved by someone who would come and straighten me out, he stepped up and took me into his family.  I mean, you gotta think back then, for a man to come home and announce to his wife, "I'm bringing my bastard child into the child.  He needs to be here.  We need to save him," and to have the power to do that without anybody, you know--today, few men would, would go that far.  So he, he is responsible for making that change.  So there are some times, I think from him, I have a sense of character that I rely.  My mother was one of the most creative people I ever met.  I think my creativity, my instincts, my art, my love of art, colors, fashion, came from my mother.  And my mother was incredible with her hands.  She was not well educated, but my mother could do anything.  She could lay bricks.  She could, she could build furniture.  She could, she could--she made her clothes.  She made hats.  My mother was--crochet, knit.  She's one of the most resourceful people that I've ever met.   And despite her past pain, she was always creative.
Story_ID: 296819
Speaker 1: One quick story that I'll always remember, my mother [Augustine Wilkins] and I had a lot of conflict.  We argued a lot.  And I think we argued because my mother, in my estimation, quit very early.  I started taking care of my mother when she was about thirty-two years old.  She just quit.  She had very poor luck with men, just horrible luck with men.  I don't know why.  She was a beautiful woman, gorgeous woman, but just did not have a great relationship with men.  They all abused and used her.
Speaker 2: Now, was she bipolar as you said?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean looking back now, yeah, but we didn't know what it was.  You know, evil (laughter).  But I look back now--
Speaker 2: So she was subject to change her--
Speaker 1: Yes, her mood could go, you know, and, and, but she was loving, very loving.  On the loving side, she'd give you the clothes off her back.  But she had very bad, her--and I think a lot of that comes from her, she loved men.  She just loved them and wanted to be loved.  And she never got the love.  So I became the center of her world for love and attention and when I, when we were--when I started taking care of her and she lived with me for a while off and on, and I would get a place for her, and I always kept her near me, even to the day she died.  Out in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], she was--I'd always have a place for her and take care of her.  Well, I began to resent it as a person because I became the parent.  And I'm like, I'm the son.  You know, and I lost my [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid] and my father [William Reid] the same year in '73 [1973], and it just, it rocked my world.  Two thirds of my being left this planet at the same time.  And so my mother and I had a lot of conflict, but I knew we had to settle this.  I just knew we had, and we (unclear).  But so, the year that she passed away some strange things happened.  I was nominated for an Emmy [Award], for two Emmys as a matter of fact for a show called 'Frank's Place.'  I was at the pinnacle at that time of my creative career.  Plus, I was moving up.  I was being called upon.  I, William (unclear), I mean it was just, it was an incredible part of my life.  I was making a lot of money and living well.  And I knew I had to make peace with my mother.  So one morning about seven [o'clock], I was outside in my, my estate.  And I was, for some reason, I always had to work with my hands when I get troubled, and I was nervous about the upcoming Emmy Award, I mean Emmy, I was nominated, and I was very worried, you know, worried about this.  Am I gonna win?  The show was on the cusp of being cut off, not being picked up.  I went out and started building a concrete wall in my property.  I had cleared it away, and I had been up very early, sunrise.  I was out building, and I had gotten the wall up, and I was laying this concrete brick, putting the mortar down.  And I could sense somebody over my shoulder.  I looked up and there was my mother.  And she was smiling, and she says, "How did you learn how to do that?" 'cause I never took any bricklaying class.  And I looked at her and said just as honestly and true, I said, "You taught me."  My mother, I had never seen her cry.  And my mother and she had of me, and of all the things that I've done, we connected.  She knew that that third of me, that creative side of me came from her.  She was so proud, and our--we settled.  Everything behind us, every--you just knew, we just knew that we settled.  And I think we embraced.  And I was like, wow, and she was happy.  And I was leaving to go to New Orleans [Louisiana].  Well, she died the next morning, had an aneurysm and died.  And I think back, had we not made peace, I would have the guilt of that relationship with me for the rest of my life.  But because we were able to make peace that morning, that next morning, when she passed, it was an interesting sort of experience in my life for me.  But I loved her dearly.  It's just that it was that--and I understood after a while.  It all kind of came to me after that what it was all about.
Story_ID: 296820
Speaker 1: In those early days, did you move around quite a bit with your mother [Augustine Wilkins] when you were a little kid (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh gosh, my mother moved--do you know, I, I moved so much.  I think I, I don't think I ever lived in the same place more than two years, three years of my life.  When we were young, every time rent was due, when I lived with my mother until I was nine, every time rent was due 'cause she could never pay the rent.  And my, as I say, her husband at that time, George Bright, was a heroin addict.  All the money came, he'd shoot up in his arm, and--
Speaker 1: And so you actually took his name at a certain point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--I've had three names (laughter).  I think I told, talking about bipolar, I'm a third of a third of a third.  Well, George Bright, Jr. was a smart little kid who had been moved up in school.  I was in Catholic school [St. Mary's, Baltimore, Maryland] at a time, baptized as a Catholic and was in Baltimore [Maryland], but poverty, oh, God, poverty.  We couldn't, I mean there were days, two, maybe two days that we didn't eat.  And she would hustle together and get twenty-one cents and she'd send me down to a little Jewish grocer.  I will never forget this little man and his son and his wife.  We'd go to his little store in Baltimore and he knew who we were.  And I would say, "Mama said, could we have some baloney and some bread and she'd like to have three cigarettes and a Stanback--a BC Powder or Stanback," 'cause she always had headaches.  And he said, "Okay."  And I would have to sign the back of a brown paper bag for the amount, and he'd let us run up a bill.  And had that man not let us run up those bills, there were days we wouldn't eat for many days.  And I used to play with his son occasionally in the yard, and I just remember that for about--I mean that's vivid in my mind, going to that little Jewish grocery store--
Speaker 1: So you were in Catholic school in--
Speaker 2: I was in Catholic school.
Speaker 1: And about how old were you when you took the name George Bright and--
Speaker 2: Probably from four to nine, for about five years, I was George Bright, Jr.  I was Timothy Isabel [Jr.] up to that point and then George Bright, Jr.  And (laughter), one of my favorite, I was no longer--when I moved to my [paternal] grandmother's [Beulah Reid] she baptized me as a Christian.  She said, "No, we're not gonna have any of this Catholic stuff." (Laughter) So she baptized me as Christian, as a Christian when I was, as soon as I got there.
Story_ID: 296821
Speaker 1: I'll tell you this story.  Actually, it's a story in one of the books that have been written about that part, the early part of my life.  (Laughter) The, one day--I don't have to tell anybody about Catholic school in terms of the corporal punishment.  But one day I was out in the back, in the yard with all the kids in recess.  And it was at St. Mary's in Baltimore [Maryland], down at the end of Pennsylvania Avenue where it all kind of comes to a little point in this little Catholic school and church, St. Mary's.  And we were at--we had recess.  And they would always keep the younger, lower grades from the upper grades 'cause they didn't want us to be influenced by these older kids.  And, of course, what do all the young kids wanna do?  They wanna be near the older kids.  And there was a little area of the playground that had, divided by a wall, an opening in the wall about that big that we, all the older kids would go back there 'cause they would, somebody would smoke or whatever they would do.  And, of course, all the young kids wanted to be back there.  But we were told, "Don't ever go back there."  So, of course, where do we wanna go?  And it became my time to try to get back there, and I was like, nah, man, they--so one of the kids, "Come on, don't be a sissy, get on with me," (laughter).  So we go back there, and as soon as we get back there, the head sister, I mean she was like, she, she was a tough, like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the habit (laughter).  This woman, every stereotype you can think of a nun, she had, tough, mean-looking woman.  She came in and we all saw her.  She was the enforcer.  It's like, oh, my God.  So she took out her strap, and those were the days of corporal punishment.  They had this leather strap like nine tails almost.  Just like, she says, "All right."  And she let all the big kids go by.  She wouldn't touch them.  She, she scolded them.  She said, "I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm writing your name.  I know who you are."  And the little kids, about four of us, now we're cornered.  You can't get out.  There's a chain link fence and this opening.  She took her habit.  She pulled her robe like that and made a crawl space.  She says, "Okay, come on."  One kid would go and try to get under it.  She'd stop, clamp her legs down and hit him with the strap on the butt. Bam, bam, about three or four licks, bam, let the kid go.  He'd cry and run off.  I'm sitting there going, oh, God, I don't want to get hit.  So everybody had gone.  I'm not moving.  She said, "Come on, George [HistoryMaker Tim Reid]."  She said, "Come on."  No, no, no.  She said, "Oh, you're gonna come."  No, no, no.  So finally, she just stated, she said--and I said, all right, you might as well come.  So she was angry and red in the face that I had made her wait this long--the bell had rung, that when I got there, she clamped down on my neck and started hitting me with these [cat o'] nine tails.  And she hit me quite a bit, and then she let me go.  I cried and went back.
Story_ID: 296822
Speaker 1: That night I'm home and my mother [Augustine Wilkins] was very, very serious about me staying clean and she bathed me two, three times a day.  I'm in the bathtub.  She said, "Go get in the bathtub."  So I'm in the bathtub.  She comes in there, sees the welts on my back and loses it.  "What happened?"  I tell her what happened?  She said, "What?"  She said, "Oh, we'll straighten this out."  My mother did not sleep that night (laughter).  I'm sitting on, I slept on the sofa.  She didn't sleep.  I could see her arguing, yes, she's angry all night long, building up.  So that morning, dawn, I'm up.  She walks with me now, well, she walked.  I flew because she drug me.  I mean my foot touched the ground maybe three times between the house and the school [St. Mary's, Baltimore, Maryland].  When that bell rang and all the people--we had to form outside in lines before they let us in class.  She got there.  The people were standing.  She says, "Which one?"  And I pointed to the sister.  I said, "That one."  She let me go.  She went over.  She grabbed this woman by the shoulder, and spun her around, and she says, "You hit my son."  And the woman said, "Who are you?"  She says, and she pointed to me.  She said, "That's my son.  You hit my son."  The woman said, "Well, he wouldn't"--she hauled off (laughter) and hit this nun (laughter) and attacked her.  And the place went into pandemonium, just went chaos, kids screaming, (laughter) people running.  I'm standing there, and she's wailing on this nun.  I mean they're going at it, and the nun outweighed her by at least sixty pounds (laughter).  So finally one of the, some of the other sisters came over and pulled my mother off her.  And the monsignor or whoever came out, and next thing I remember, we're all sitting in the monsignor's office, and there's the nun, my mother and me, and we explain what happened.  And she says, "No, no, no, you don't hit my son, you don't hit my son.  I don't, I ought to"--and he's trying to calm her down 'cause when my mother went there, you either had to lock her up or (laughter), you just didn't, she was not to be dealt with calmly to say the least.  Well, anything--anyway, long story short, he knew he had a situation here that was not one that he wanted to go out in public.  So they settled it.  From that point on, that nun became one of my best friends.  She used to give me slingshots and bean shooters (laughter).  I got promoted to the next grade (laughter).  I was, I became an altar boy, but I will never forget that day (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, that's interesting 'cause I expected the next thing was that you'd be kicked out of school or, but they didn't do it.
Speaker 1: She was, she so wrong.  And, you know, what was interesting, I had to say that the nun confessed.  She said, she said, "Yes, I lost my temper."  And I think it was because of that that the monsignor, of course, he didn't want, you know--it was different times back then.  This is, this was in the early '50s [1950s].  Korea [Korean War] was going on, you know.  It was a different time in the country.  You know, they didn't, the country was more focused on survival, the war in Korea and people coming back from World War II [WWII] trying to settle.  I mean it was a whole different time.
Speaker 2: So how old were you then?  About--
Speaker 1: I was about, let's see, about five or six years old.
Speaker 2: Okay, sounded like--
Speaker 1: Yeah, about six years old, yeah, about six or seven--nah, wait a minute, no, I was seven.  I was seven years old when that happened.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, fifty--
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951], '52 [1952] something like that.  Yeah, yeah, I was in Baltimore [Maryland] in the early '50s [1950s].
Story_ID: 296823
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were in Baltimore [Maryland] until you were--?
Speaker 2: Until I was nine.
Speaker 1: 'Til you--
Speaker 2: Well, remember I moved around.  We were in Nashville, Tennessee.  We were in, God, my mother [Augustine Wilkins] moved so much.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you start off--do you start off in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: No, I started off in Norfolk [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Norfolk.
Speaker 2: And then she left Norfolk after having a big battle with my father [William Reid].  She got, she got, got in some trouble.
Speaker 1: This is a battle with George Bright?
Speaker 2: No, no, my real father.
Speaker 1: Oh, your real father.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother attacked him (laughter) because--and she was pregnant with me at the time.  She didn't know my father was married, and when she found out, she lost it and went to the church [New Calvary Baptist Church, Norfolk, Virginia] where he was a member.  And in front of everyone one Sunday morning, took a brick and broke out every window in his car (laughter), pregnant, in front of him and his wife (laughter).  So my mother was, it was suggested my mother leave town (laughter).  So she left Norfolk after I was born.  I think I was about a year old, maybe two years old, year and a half, she left Norfolk and moved to, I think Nashville, and stayed there for a while and then moved to Baltimore for a little period.  And then when my uncle, I mean my father at that time, George Bright, because of his addiction, there was always very bad times and so sometimes we would come back to Norfolk.  His, his sister, my Aunt Belle ran the largest whorehouse in Norfolk at that time.  So I lived with my mother and my then father in this whorehouse for about, off and on, for about a year for a few months at a time.  Whenever things were really bad, we'd go stay there for six months.
Speaker 1: In Baltimore?
Speaker 2: In Norfolk.  The whore house was in Norfolk, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, in Norfolk, okay.
Speaker 2: So I would stay there for a while.  So I've had a colorful past to say the least, all of which to go into making me who I am, good and bad (laughter).
Story_ID: 296824
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, it's a funny thing about, about how I grew up.  As strange as it sounds in today's world, it was an exciting community I grew up in.  I grew up in two communities that were exciting when it comes to black community.  Norfolk, Virginia, Church Street, was a vibrant community, music, sounds, juke joints, speakeasies, dance, all this stuff was happening.  You know, we were, Norfolk was on the Chitterling Circuit [Chitlin' Circuit], so you might see in any given night, you may walk by--I saw Pigmeat Markham.  We used to sneak in, as kids into the theaters for the 'Midnight Ramble.'  Moms Mabley, Lash LaRue, you know, all these people would come through these towns--
Speaker 1: Lash LaRue (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lash LaRue.  [George] "Gabby" Hayes almost killed me.  The first time I was ever on stage in my life was in, we used to have, we used to have Saturday matinees for movies.  And I think I was nine years old, and it cost fifteen cents to go to the Saturday matinee.  You'd go in there, and you'd see two movies, double play, and you'd see the, the short, 'Flash Gordon' or whatever it is in between the movies, right.  So I go to this movie.  It was 'The Rio' [ph].  The movie was called 'The Rio,' and they would sometimes, instead of a short, they would have a, whoever was visiting the area.  So that day they were showing 'The Outlaws' [sic. 'The Outlaw'] with Jayne Mansfield, and (laughter) in between, out comes Gabby Hayes.  He's on stage.  Kids are going wild, Gabby Hayes, you know, 'cause he was, Howdy Doody, you know, all that stuff, Gabby Hayes, oh, wow.
Speaker 1: These were the Roy Rogers--
Speaker 2: Roy Rogers, I mean this was like, you know (laughter).  And so this was unbelievable.
Speaker 1: And cowboy culture was big.
Speaker 2: Oh, I, we--I had the six shooters and everything.  So Gabby Hayes got, so he says, "All right, young whipper snappers," or whatever he said.  He says, "I'm gonna bring two of you up on stage.  How many of you believe I can lift you with two fingers?"  He said, all right, so some guy from his group came out to pick the kids.  So he's walking down the middle of the aisle.  I'm sort of like four or five in.  And he says, "I'm gonna pick a kid."  And the kids were just screaming, "Ahh, pick me, pick me."  Something said to me, if you stay calm, you'll stand out.  That's all I remember something saying to me.  So I just kind of went calm.  He came up the aisle.  He looked at me.  I looked at him.  He says, "You!"  And it shocked me.  He picked me, it worked.  So I get up, and he picked a little girl.  The two of us go up on stage.  And I'm looking--I had never been on the stage in my life.  Kids are screaming, the lights in my eyes.  I can't see anything.  And these sights and sounds (laughter).  And so he looks at me.  I'm standing next to him, and he looks at me and says, "Hey, young whipper snapper, and I look up at him, and it's Gabby Hayes.  He said, do you think I can pick you up with two fingers.  And I said, "Unh-uh."  He hit me right here in the throat, like this.  He went bam, he picked me up right off my foot, bam dropped me down.  Well, when he hit me, he hit me so hard, that he jammed--I'm choking up thinking about it now, he jammed this back, so when he let me down I couldn't breathe.  I was (heaving).  And so I can't breathe.  And now, he's going, oh, and all of a sudden he noticed that this kid now is having a problem.  So one of his guys looks and Gabby looks at the guy and does that.  The guy comes and grabs like this.  I'm going (heaving). (Laughter) He takes me over to a door.  Now, I don't know what he's gonna do, takes me over to the door.  He hits the door, the door flies open.  It's bright light 'cause it's the exit right outside of the theater, and they push me out of the door and slam it (laughter), true story.  So when he slams the door, I go outside, the bright light, the shock of coming out of darkness and light caused me to gasp (heaving) and in gasping, I managed to get some air.  So I went (heaving).  And I finally get it back and a little bruised, and I went, ah.  So now I wanna get back in the theater.  They won't let me in (laughter) and I don't have fifteen cents.  So I cry and walk home, and that's the first time I've ever been on stage.  Gabby Hayes tried to kill me (laughter).
Speaker 1: That sounds like a Krusty the Clown-type story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she (laughter) tried to kill me.  I'll never forget that Gabby Hayes tried to kill me (laughter).  But I made my stage debut (laughter).
Story_ID: 296825
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sights and sounds were exciting.  It was oysters on the street, hustlers, vivid activity, color, noise and, and characters.  My background is, and I think that, again, it fosters sort of the storytelling opportunities for me, I was always surrounded by characters, transient roomers coming into my, into my [paternal] grandmother's [Beulah Reid] place with stories to tell, some sad, some fun, some--a longshoreman.  You know, we lived in--Norfolk [Virginia] was the home of NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization].  So when I was a young kid, if you lived in Norfolk when I--I mean from the time, nine, up, you'd have to say greetings in at least three or four languages because all the sailors wanted to come down to try their luck to get a little colored girl.  So they were always in all the bars.  All the bars were named after ships, the Enterprise, and so the place was busy.  It was, they used to call it Little Harlem.  Music was coming into its own.  When I was in high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia], Gary U.S. Bonds, The Showmen, Chairmen [of the Board]--I mean all these musical--the Birdland record store on the corner was where--was the hub of music.  We had seven movie theaters in walking distance of my home that were either run or managed by blacks, clubs.  So it was a vibrant community, all black-owned or operated.  So that it was a--I didn't know anything about white America.  I was very content in my world.  It was all business, a black newspaper, a black cab company.  I would never think to bring a, you know, a white cab.  We had black, Broadway Cabs.  The newspaper was the [Norfolk] Journal and Guide [New Journal and Guide], the mortgage company, the insurance company, North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina].
Story_ID: 296826
Speaker 1: It was an interesting community [in Norfolk, Virginia] for me to grow up, which, by the way, as my character developed in this environment, and I went to all-black schools, segregated 'cause we had massive resistance in Virginia.  Remember, we didn't, when they--after Brown v. Board [of Education of Topeka, 1954], Virginia ignored it until the '60s [1960s].  So we were in segregated schools.  But because Virginia is a very unique state even in its segregation and racism, when they said, "massive resistance," it was the, the way they passed the rule, if they built a white school, they built an identical black school, unlike the other South where they didn't build anything.  So my high school, Crestwood High School [Chesapeake, Virginia] was an identical copy of Great Bridge High School [Chesapeake, Virginia].  So we were segregated, but we had, at that time, interesting opportunities.  Our teachers were unbelievable.  The schools had everything--in high school, I took woodworking.  I took electronics.  I took tailoring.  I took brick masonry.  All those things that I know how to do today, I kind of honed them.  I know how to make clothes.  I mean I can, I know how to sew.  I know--all those things you could take as, like art, they had art classes.  Things that are missing in high school today, we had.  And we had great teachers.  They were coming out of these black colleges [HBCUs], and the only place they could get a job were these black schools.  So massive resistance in the sense of segregation was, was bad, but it nurtured a generation of young kids who went out and accomplished all around the world, many things coming out of the era.  I was the first black hired by DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company] in management.
Story_ID: 296827
Speaker 1: Can you--and I know this'll probably be difficult to do, can you actually give us a rundown of the schools that you attended, leading up to high school?
Speaker 2: Leading up to high school, I went to Laurie [E.] Titus Elementary School [Norfolk, Virginia]--well, first the Catholic school was St. Mary's in Baltimore [Maryland], and then when I moved back to Norfolk [Virginia] to live with my [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid], I was in Laurie Titus Elementary School.  And then from there, I went to [William Henry] Ruffner Junior High School [Norfolk, Virginia], but that's when I got in the trouble, and they took me out of that.  Rather than take me to reform school, they let me go, I went and lived with my father [William Reid].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he put me in Crestwood High School [Chesapeake, Virginia], which no longer exists.  And then from Crestwood High School, I then went to Norfolk State University--or Norfolk State College [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia].
Speaker 1: So you graduated from Crestwood?
Speaker 2: No, I graduated from Crestwood High School, and then college Norfolk State University.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  So I just wanted to get that.  Now, along the way in grade school, before we get you in high school, did you have a favorite subject in grade school, or focus (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Play hooky (laughter).  No, I was not a good student.  I was not a good student in elementary school.  I was a good student in Catholic school, very bright.  And then I got to--again, my grandmother sort of loose freedom.  But, you know, I look back on it, and say, yes, my grandmother was loose, she--liquor house and all that, but she was aware of the life that I had lived, the restrictions and the fact that I was confined and the life that I had seen as a young kid.  And I think she gave me the freedom that I had missed, and it was more freedom than I should have had.  But it was an unusual freedom, and I never wanted for anything.  Although she had some difficult times when roomers didn't pay, I never wanted for anything.  And so my father gave me restriction.  He taught me rules.  He, you know, "You will abide by my rules in my house or I'll kill you," kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, so you had one life as George Bright [Jr.] in the Catholic school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --with a lot of restrictions--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --nuns that would beat you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and George Bright, himself, was a--
Speaker 2: Heroin addict, died a heroin addict.
Speaker 1: And, but he was a heroin addict.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then you go from that to, you know, another name even--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I became Timothy Reid.
Speaker 1: --and another role.
Speaker 2: Yeah, another role and complete freedom.  I mean it was like turning a horse loose in a wild thing, you know, and said, go back to your wild life (laughter), you know, so, in the wilderness kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my father stepped in.
Story_ID: 291387
Speaker 1: So when you're twelve, and you finally get with your father [William Reid], you're at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I moved to--
Speaker 1: --[William Henry] Ruffner Junior High School [Norfolk, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, but he took me out of that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he took me to, back to the country.  It was called Crestwood [High School, Chesapeake, Virginia].  And Crestwood was the country.  It was then called Norfolk County [Virginia].  It's now Chesapeake [Virginia], but it was called Norfolk County.  And that was like leaving Rome [Italy] and, and going to Puerto Rico (laughter), I mean it was just a complete change of lifestyles.  And it was the country.  And I hated it.  I just, I just hated it, and now I was thrown in this school.  And my father had importance.  He was then the president of the city league or like the local little city council kind of thing.  And so I was, I was under the microscope, and he was pretty, pretty restrictive about what he expected of me.  And, but he worked a lot.  He was always working nights.  He drove a cab at night, and he was a brakeman on the Norfolk and Western [Railway] coal car, so he worked very hard.  And he didn't have the--he wasn't there a lot.  And my stepmother and I had a, a most unusual relationship.  She was very cold, but she yet, I give her nothing but respect in the fact that she let me in her home.  She wasn't warm to me, but she was not, she respected my father and his wishes.  But she, she stayed out of my way, but was never rude and never warm, and yet never did anything to endanger my, my being.  She, she accepted who I was.  So I spent a lot of time out of doors with friends.
Speaker 1: What about your half brothers and sisters?  Did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, there was no other ones at that time, well, there were, but we didn't know about 'em (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I found out about them much later.
Speaker 1: But none in that household.
Speaker 2: No, I was the only one that he took in.  I was the only one he took in and gave his name.
Speaker 1: But you had other brothers and sisters out in the--
Speaker 2: Had one other, one other sister, and then later in life, my, when my father passed, there were a few.  But--
Speaker 1: But he didn't have any children with your stepmother?
Speaker 2: No, they were, she was, she was not able, she was unable to have children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 291388
Speaker 1: And [Crestwood] High School [Chesapeake, Virginia] was--I didn't apply myself in high school.  I didn't, I didn't think about school as an alternative, as again, it was not something in my family that was, you know, like you're expected to go to college in black families.  You're expected to get a, you know, to do well in school.  I come from a very working class mentality in my family.  I mean it was very structured in terms of survival.  I'm a survivor.  I'll survive in just about any condition.  I was taught to do that.  I feel capable of surviving in just about any condition.  There wasn't a lot of victimization in our family.  We were, we were people who would survive, come hell or high water, even if someone had to suffer.  I mean we did what we had to do.  So it was a very frontier (laughter) kind of attitude in my family.  Education was, you know, okay, if you can do it.  If not, but what you've gotta do is survive.  You gotta eat and you gotta support yourself.  So you'd better learn how do to do that, however, you wanna know how to do that.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, you were starting to tell me about the teachers and the high quality of teaching at Crestwood.
Speaker 1: The teachers in both elementary school, but in high school.  We had a high school that was, the teachers were unbelievable.  I mean it turned out Super Bowl heroes, scientists, I mean these--the people that came out of the segregated school system in Virginia were extraordinary, the science, the math.  I remember--matter of fact, the first gentleman hired by NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] was in high school.  He was a couple of years ahead of me.  I remember [HistoryMaker] Julian [Manly] Earls.  He, I mean it was just amazing, these teachers, art.  They, they took special care.  They were hard on us.  They were, they expected the best of us, and there was structure.  You didn't, again, this was corporal punishment days in high school and in college.  You could stand up to 'em if you wanted to, but they would, they would, they would stand you down.
Story_ID: 291389
Speaker 1: I remember one day in math class [at Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia], we had a little tough guy in there.  He was a pretty tough kid.  And we respected him, you know, not necessarily afraid of him, but we knew he was, you know, you didn't push him unless you expected to go with him, go down with him.  And one day he said something to one of the teachers.  The teacher said, "Young man, you know you--sit down.  You don't talk that way in this class."  And he stood up and charged the teacher.  Boy, that teacher took him out (laughter).  I mean he took him out.  He was a military guy (laughter), he took him out, had him down and escorted him out, you know, and threw him out of school.  And so you saw that, and you were like, don't mess with that one.  We had a gentleman there who, to this day, I don't know if he's still alive, but if he is, he's, he's got respect at any age.  His name was Hiawatha Windley, but you were never allowed to call him Hiawatha.  It was Mr. Windley.  And he was a tailor, and he taught tailoring, and he was also a football coach.  Well, Mr. Windley--and I actually, when I said, Hiawatha, I felt odd by saying that, thinking, look out, I hope he doesn't hear this or see this tape (laughter).  But he demanded, he was the coolest, he was the sharpest dresser.  He always came in with a sport--he was the first fashion plate I ever saw.  This guy used to wear it with a handkerchief coming out, 'cause he was a tailor, he made his clothes.  He would take a design and zigzag it with colors on his pocket.  And I would sit there, awing with ascots.  And he was a [U.S.] military retired guy from--he fought in Korea [Korean War].  And he had been wounded so he walked with a limp, handsome, respectful man.  Those were the kind of images we saw.  The coaches, Coach [George] Quarles, Charles [Charlie] Stukes, he went on to win, be a Super Bowl, some of the great basketball players that went through his program, football players.  They were, they were men, and they, they respect--while they respected us, they also demanded a certain kind of reverence and respect for who they were and what they were.  And we did.  I don't know when that all changed, but I think it has a lot to do with the '70s [1970s], the late, mid-'70s [1970s] when that all changed.  But it was a different world then.  And I have nothing but utmost respect.  My ability to survive was also fed by what we learned from these men, what they demanded and what they expected (background noise).
Story_ID: 291391
Speaker 1: I mean I can't say enough about that era of teachers, that era of education, whether you expected it or not.  They expected more of us, which I took with me all of my life.  You see I never, they never allowed you to even conceive of being a victim.  There was no victimization being taught.  There was no victimization being--you know, this was, there was no welfare in the system then.  Had there been I'm sure my family would have wanted to use it.  There was nothing like that.  So you were expected to survive at your wits with your, whatever you had, you had to survive, hustlers or whatever it was.  It was a different world, a different, different kind of thing.  There was no victimization.  I, I grew up--again, I never spoke socially to a white person until I was in the Civil Rights Movement in the '60s [1960s], sixty--I would say '63 [1963], maybe '64 [1964].  I didn't have a white friend, and when I say, friend, someone that I respected and spoke to until '65 [1965], never worked for one until I got to college [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia].
Speaker 2: That's after high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia] 'cause--
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was, I'm talking about college.  The first time I ever worked for a white person was my summer year of '63 [1963] when I was going, I decided to go to college.  Well, I take that--I worked at Sears [Roebuck and Co.] one year in high school, but never, never had an experience.  I'd never, we'd go to--we'd go downtown to, to the white section, we'd put on a different face.
Story_ID: 291393
Speaker 1: We'd just put on a different face.
Speaker 2: Was there overt segregation in the (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh, yes, back of the bus, colored only, all that stuff.  I grew up in that era.  The tail end--well, not even the tail end of, the latter part of it, I should say.  Yeah, segregation, blacks only, I mean white only, colored only, all that stuff.  But that was outside of our environment.  As long as we stayed in colored town, as long as we stayed in Church Street [Norfolk, Virginia] and that area, it was designated by race by segregation, we had a different life.  I didn't, you know, it's amazing.  I see some of these movies now, and I think about, you know, the health and all this, and how important it was for whites to interact with blacks and how these noble white people--I never met any.  I never met a noble white person in my entire life until I got into the Civil Rights Movement, and I started meeting some of the young Jewish kids and people who were involved in the Civil Rights Movements.  I'd never met a noble white person.  Every white person I ever met was one of concern and danger because it, it just did not fit in my environment.  I'm not saying they didn't exist in America, but I'm talking about in my world.  Also, I never feared them because I'd been around people who I'd seen do some extraordinary things and survive and were not to be fooled with, no matter what race you were.  You did not fool with my father [William Reid].  You did not fool with Mr. [Hiawatha] Windley.  You did not fool with Coach [George] Quarles.  These were men, and I knew that.  They were war heroes, and they had fought in World War II [WWII].  I knew Tuskegee Airmen.  I knew people who had come back from Korea [Korean War].  These were serious men.  So I respected them, and so I didn't have that victimization.  I still don't have it.  I've never felt as being a victim, never have.  And I don't allow my kids [Tori Reid and Timothy Reid II] to even conceive of that.  So when I went to Hollywood and I start getting out into the world, when I went to work for DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company] and became the first black hired by them, I went in with a, strangely a superiority complex.  I went with like, ya'll don't know who you're dealing with here.  The same thing in Hollywood, when I got into situations, I, I stood and fought.  I have a reputation, not one that I'm proud of, but a serious reputation is that I hit back, I fight back, you know.  You're not going to sell me a victimization fear factor that you use to move your superiority forward.  It doesn't work here.  It didn't work back in Norfolk [Virginia], it certainly ain't gonna work here in Hollywood 'cause I know most of 'em are poot butts, you know, (laughter).  They, just 'cause they go to the Laker [Los Angeles Lakers] game and sit in the front row, they feel they know black people (laughter).  As they say in the--"Homey don't play that," (laughter).  So in my hometown, you had to earn your status.  You earned it by your deeds, good or bad.  You, if you say you were a bad dude, you'd better have the history to prove it, or they take you out.  So all that came out of growing up in that time.  And I'm not the only one.  I talk to a lot of people who are now my age or in that era, from the South in particular, and they all kind of talk that way.  They all kind of say, "Yeah, it was different back then."  Now, that doesn't mean it was the good ole days.  But it was different.  Certainly wasn't the good ole days.
Story_ID: 291396
Speaker 1: You knew some of the members of the Norfolk 17, right--
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, yes.
Speaker 1: --who integrated the schools.  I mentioned, I think, before we started, [HistoryMaker] Andrew Heidelberg (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Andrew Heidelberg.
Speaker 1: And you probably knew some others, too, but, you know, they integrated Norview High School [Norfolk, Virginia] and some others, some of the other white high schools in the Norfolk [Virginia] area and were really treated bad.  We heard his--you know, did you hear those stories from them?
Speaker 2: Stories?  I was a part of them.  I was, there's an article that was written about me at one point in my--this was in 1963.  And they quoted me in the article as, they called me "Mr. Civil Rights."  My father [William Reid] was one of the founders of the City of Chesapeake [Virginia].  My father lost his job because he stood up to his white supervisor.  That kind of thing--I was part of a group.  I was, I was not the--I was the weakest link in this civil rights group, but we marched.  We helped integrate Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company], the White Castles, we always in the streets--
Speaker 1: Now, was this going on during the same--
Speaker 2: This was in the '63 [1963], '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that's a little later, but I'm talking about the Norfolk Seventeen, that's like 1957 when they start in--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but you've got to realize that the real, the real movement in Virginia predates Rosa Parks, predates all of 'em, and that's Barbara [Rose] Johns in 1951 in Farmville, Virginia, the first resistance movement, stood and resistance movements in the history of Virginia, I mean in the country, happened before [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], happened in Farmville, Virginia with Barbara Johns.  She started what--and her case became part of the Brown v. Board [of Education of Topeka, 1954].  She started the whole resistance movement, and I say that to say when you think of the South, Virginia has a really interesting history in terms of massive resistance, in terms of--both black and white, unlike a lot of cities in the South.  Unlike Mississippi or Alabama or places like that.  It's a different, different mentality of both racism and the fight for equality, a little differently, not better than, just different.  There was, I think, probably more feeling of superiority in the minds of black people I find coming out of Virginia than they have been.  I mean you just start naming the Booker T. [Washington], I mean you just name some of the people, Frederick Douglass.  I mean Virginia--I just did the history of Virginia for a project here, and we spent three years doing this projects.  We've honed the history down to twenty minutes and when you look at some of the history in this state 'cause Virginia was America for about a hundred years, there's some incredible history here, poll tax.  Most of the racial laws that were used, passed down to other states started here, [U.S.] Supreme Court's decisions, and I mean Virginia has a very strange, unusual, sad, but powerful history in terms of slavery.  The most slaves in one state, Virginia.  Slavery started here, Virginia.  The first blacks brought from Africa in 1619 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixteen-nineteen [1619].
Speaker 2: The--Virginia was the state that decided, let's stop buying these slaves from Portugal and from Spain and from England because they're charging too much.  Let's inbreed, and they began the breeding farm system.  It left here and went other places, and, you know, but at one time, most of the slaves in America were in Virginia.  When you look at the Fugitive Slave Act [of 1850], why was it passed?  Henry "Box" Brown, you know (laughter), so when you start thinking about, you know, Virginia and its racial history, it is a very unique one.  I'm not saying better than.  It's a very unique one.
Story_ID: 291398
Speaker 1: Well, growing up in that, knowing the history of Nat Turner, the revolt--
Speaker 2: So did you know that then?  Did you have the history back then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, we were taught that, you see what I'm saying?  It was, there was a pride in the black community here about stuff like that.  And, and we stayed insulated.  And a lot of it had to do with, there was a [U.S.] military community 'cause you had--you know, I remember being, in my, in my aunt's whorehouse, Aunt Belle's whorehouse, seeing white soldiers and black soldiers coming in.  I remember when my [paternal] grandmother's [Beulah Reid] house, I mean you'd see people speaking foreign languages.  Who is this person?  Well, he's from Portugal.  Where is Portugal?  You know, so there was, you'd go, you'd walk down Church Street [Norfolk, Virginia], you saw multi-racial things that you did not see anywhere else at that time for a young kid.  This was my world.  I was fortunate enough because my mother [Augustine Wilkins], when my mother gave me up at nine, and after George Bright lost and I think killed himself with an overdose, she then was lost.  She went to work as a, as the help.  She was a live-in for most of my--from, from, I think from thirteen until I graduated from high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia] she was, she lived in--a white family in Hempstead, New York.  And I was allowed to go visit her during Christmas for one week and two weeks in the summer.  And they lived, this family lived in Hempstead, New York, and then they had a place up in Lake Placid [New York], and in summers, they would go up there in summer, and my mother would go up there, of course, and work for them.  And I was allowed to come visit.  The first drink I ever had in my life, I had in the hotel in Lake Placid, New York.  So I was expected--funny thing.  I'd go visit my mother, but I was expected to work while I was there.  They wanted to teach me a sense of responsibility, and yet I never saw one of their kids ever pick up anything other than a fork and put it in his face (laughter).  But nonetheless, when I got to visit my mother, I was expected to work.  So I washed cars, cleaned up the garage, do little odd things.  You know, I'd pick him up from the airport some time in his red convertible Cadillac, you know, that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 291400
Speaker 1: So I was exposed to, by virtue of life, when I would go visit my mother [Augustine Wilkins] in Baltimore [Maryland] before, before she left to go live with them [in New York], my [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid], smart woman, smartest woman, one of the smartest people I ever met in my life, she would dress me up in a Boy Scout[s of America] uniform.  I'd say, "Grandma, I'm getting on the bus to go to, why are we"--she says, "Because"--remember, this is right after Korea [Korean War], she says, "Because white people like people in uniform.  They won't bother you," 'cause see I had to be on the back of the bus.  When I'd come through Richmond [Virginia], and they'd stop--when we'd leave Norfolk [Virginia], no freeway system at that time, we'd get up to Richmond, and right outside of Richmond, there was the first bus stop.  And you'd get off the bus to go to the counter to get yourself something.  Well, black people couldn't go in the restaurant.  We had to go around the back.  And I remember one day I was very hungry 'cause it was late, and they put me on the bus.  And I always traveled with a tag around my neck like I was luggage.  And I walked in, I was following some people on the, who got off the bus, and I wasn't thinking.  And I followed these people.  I was looking at bodies, not color.  And I walked in following the man, and next thing I know, I'm in the line in the white restaurant.  And I'm standing there, and you could hear a pin drop.  Everybody's looking at me, and a black woman behind the counter, she's going psst, psst, and I look up.  She said, "Get on, get on," like that.  And I'm going like, said, "Get off."  Everybody else is stunned.  They're just looking at me like, white people was going like, he'd better dematerialize quickly.  So finally, I don't know what to do.  I'm standing there in my uniform, and they're all looking at me, and I think the uniform threw 'em for a pause.  And she--I remember her coming around from behind the, the serving place, grabbing me by my arm and forcefully snatching me around, out to a side door and pushed me out and shut the door.  And she did like that.  And I walked around where all the black people were standing in line, and I got in line.  And as I stood in line, that same woman came around and she says, "Baby, over here," pulled me out all the line.  I went over, and she gave me a hot dog and a drink.  "No, no, you don't pay.  Go over here," same woman, whole new thing.  She gave me my hot dog and she says, "Now, you go sit on the bus, go sit on the bus and eat your food."  And I went on the bus and sat and ate my food.  I mean that's the kind of life that I was living here in Virginia.  It was a strange dichotomy, but we looked out for each other.  Black people looked out for each other in their own way.
Story_ID: 291402
Speaker 1: Did your family discuss the story of Barbara [Rose] Johns?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't--we, we knew about that later.  I mean, but you hear about it.  In other words, what we knew about Farmville [Virginia]--what was going on here, I mean, you know, when they closed the schools.  Yeah, we knew about that 'cause I was in the Civil Rights Movement, and the attorneys that were doing that, [HistoryMaker Oliver W.] Hill and--
Speaker 1: Oliver Hill.
Speaker 2: Oliver Hill and [HistoryMaker Henry L.] Marsh [III] and all these guys, you know, they were--and Marsh was a young man, so they--so those words got around.  Our attorney was [Joseph A.] Jordan [Jr.], a gentleman who's paraplegic, and he was the attorney that we used whenever we got arrested.  You know, whenever, before we would go on a demonstration or whatever, we would call two people.  We'd call Jordan and we'd call a Dr. [William P.] Robinson [Sr.], who was my poly sci [political science] teacher at Norfolk State [College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia].  He was the first black since Reconstruction to be elected in the state assembly here.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I didn't wanna get you to Norfolk State--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: I wanna keep it--I was asking about the Norfolk 17. Yeah.
Speaker 2: This was going on while you were in high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia].
Speaker 1: This was going on when I was in high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you knew some of them while you were in high school?  I was wondering if they talked to you about their experiences at Norview [High School, Norfolk, Virginia] and these other--
Speaker 1: Well, we knew of them.  Yeah, but we knew of them, but they were so sporadic.  It was so much going on at that time in '63 [1963].  You've got to remember, we didn't really wanna go to a white school, you know.  [HistoryMaker Andrew] Heidelberg was like one of the few people who would even like, why would you wanna go to a white school.  You're not gonna learn anything there.  I mean literally you were not gonna learn anything in a white school.  They were not gonna give you any information.  I had the best teachers in the state.  Why would I wanna go to a white school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he didn't really wanna go either.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he didn't wanna go.  So they were part of a system that we all knew about 'cause we'd hear about it in church [New Calvary Baptist Church, Norfolk, Virginia].  And we'd go, great.  But it wasn't anything that any of us were anxious to do.  You know, people forget that, that at that time, the concept of integration did not exist in the black community.  The black community was not interested in integrating with the white community.  We wanted separate, but equal.  I mean I hate to bring that up now because I'm not saying it was a right policy, but integration, I didn't wanna live next to no white people or eat with them.  I wanted the right to go and eat anywhere I wanted to go, to go to any school.  That's what we wanted, separate, but equal, and that's what the whole system was about.  That's why Virginia, in a strange way, gave in to that with massive, after massive resistance, it gave in to that.  It was one of the only states that--as a matter of fact, do you know, this is how the politics played in high school.  If you wanted to go to Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and you were black, and you had the grades that you felt made you qualified, you would apply to the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia].  You know why?  They would give you money to go to Harvard (laughter).  So we played the system.  If you wanted to go to an Ivy League school or you wanted to a white school, University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] at that time, you applied for Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia].  You applied for University of Virginia, and they would give you the money.  They would make it possible to keep you out of there.  We played the system.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's one of the most incredible things that--I've heard the story (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Virginia, it's the most unusual thing in the world (laughter).
Story_ID: 291403
Speaker 1: Did you have an academic goal in high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had no academic--
Speaker 1: --for a career or a direction?
Speaker 2: In high school, I had no academic interests whatsoever.  And high school to me was, I wasted quite a bit of time because I really did not have any aspirations.  I never thought I was gonna live past twenty-one to be honest with you.  I never, there was no future in my mind.  What there was, was living in the now.  I wanted to, you know, I was around a bunch of hustlers and young people and, and my city [Norfolk, Virginia] life.  I had like city--they used to call me city life, country life.  In city life, I had this sort of hustler, and my uncle was a hustler, and everybody, and [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid] had a boarding house and it was like fast money.  And, you know, you live in the now.  You don't think about the future.  You don't think about tomorrow.  You live in the now.  You don't think about the past.  It's like, what's going on, what's the deal, what's happening?  And then I'd come to the country, and I had these incredible teachers and this system that says structure and plan and this is where you came from.  And it was a dichotomy that troubled me  So I didn't really--I did what I had to do, but I was very inquisitive, and I loved working with my hands.  So I was in all these things.  I was on the track team.  I was doing these things, but I wasn't doing my grades well.  So when I finished high school, it hit me, oh my God, my life has ended 'cause I was pretty popular in high school.  You know, I was the vice president of the student council.  I had all, I had girls.  I was like, high school was like, hey, out here by myself, this little world in the country.  And then the weekend, I'd go to city life.  But the country life, I was pretty cool.  This was a wonderful environment for me.  Everybody was a little afraid of my father [William Reid] 'cause he had a little power so I could get away with some things that I should have been kicked out of school with.  I got away with.  So--
Speaker 1: Was there anyone in high school that was, that you would consider--I know you talked about the great teachers there, but was there anyone there who was a special mentor or guide for you or counselor?
Speaker 2: No, but there were a lot of role models, but no individual one.  I think periods of my high school life, yes.  I went through phases.  When I was in electronics and trade, there was a teacher there that was very, someone I paid attention to, and I did well in that.  Everyone else, I just kind of passed through.  You know, I didn't, I didn't really--but the totality of it is that I saw incredible role models.  I didn't really get the role models as an importance to me until I got to college [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia].

Speaker 1: Were you involved in any way in the arts in high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took an art class and began to draw and began to acquire a taste for art through an art teacher who had just come from, from graduating from Virginia State College [Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], done his internship, and he was, his first job there.  The irony of that is, talking about life's little circles, years later I married his wife's sister [Rita Sykes Reid] (laughter) and didn't even know it until I met him after I started dating.  But his name was Harmor [U.] Booker, and wonderful artist and a very outstanding man and lived in that area.  And he influenced my interest in art that has stayed with me till this date.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you get involved in any plays or anything?
Speaker 2: Not in high school.  I was--I'll tell you what I did do that probably made it possible for me to get the job at DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company].  In 1958, when I went to visit my mother [Augustine Wilkins] for Christmas up in Hempstead [New York], she gave me a Brownie Hawkeye camera with a flash, first camera I ever owned and the first picture I took was of my mother.  And when I went back to school, I wanted to play football, but I just didn't have the talent for football, and I wasn't big enough.  And I said, well, I like football, I like, 'cause they got cheerleaders, and you know, I'm on the track team, and I knew the coach.  And I said, well, I'll tell you what.  I've got a camera.  I'd like to be the photographer for the school newspaper.  So a gentleman by the name of Nicholson, Mel Nicholson [ph.], who was, had just gotten a job at the school, was gonna create a school newspaper.  And he put together a journalism club.  I joined it, and I became the photographer for the newspaper.  And I would go to all the games and take pictures.  That's how my love of photography began, and it's stayed with me, again, to this day.

Speaker 1: When you get towards high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia] graduation time, it was a--did you have good counseling?  Did somebody say, "Hey, maybe you ought to go to college," or "maybe you ought to"--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, no, when I--see I was, again, a couple things happened.  My father's [William Reid] importance, while it was good for me in some ways, it, it got me through some things that I shouldn't have--they were lenient on me when they shouldn't have been.
Speaker 1: Now, he was a city councilman in Chesapeake [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: At that time, he was president of the Civic League or the mayor, was what the, equivalent of the mayor of Crestwood [Chesapeake, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And a very powerful man in that respect, had a lot of respect in the community.  So he would help the principal, and he would go and fight--my father was a quiet fighter.  So he was unafraid of white people.  So whenever there was an issue to go talk to the supervisor of the school board or whatever, they'd send my father 'cause he had a way, better than me.  He could go and not give that anger, but he can deal with them on a level of, I wouldn't call it respect, but he didn't intimidate them, but yet they knew he was a man of his word.  So because of that a lot of people did not like that I had some of the freedoms that I, that I got.  I mean I got out of things I shouldn't have got out of.  So they didn't pay a lot of attention to me, put it this way.  They paid attention to me from a different point of view.  So no one really cared.  They didn't think I was gonna amount to much.  Nobody ever thought that I was gonna amount to much.  Most people thought that I would end up jail or, you know, a drunkard, drug addict or whatever, except maybe my [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid].  And my father was too busy surviving to, he just made sure, you know, I stayed out of trouble, and didn't have a lot.  He was struggling.  But they did pay a lot of--they, you know, they, they gave you the things that they could give you, and it was up to you to motivate yourself.  I was unmotivated by that time.  So when I graduated from high school--
Speaker 1: This is 1962?
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-three [1963], okay.
Story_ID: 296829
Speaker 1: That summer I had decided that I was going to--well, it's so much story, I don't wanna, just we could go on forever.  My father [William Reid] had built a club, a nightclub.  He wanted to go into the nightclub business.  He built a club.  And a couple of tragic things happened that brought it down on him that same summer.  It all crashed and it eventually killed my father.  I mean he died of a broken heart for what happened that summer.
Speaker 2: Well, this sounds important.  You may as well tell me.  I don't know how we can skim over this--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, well, my father in '62 [1962] decided, he had just been fired for standing up, and he wouldn't bow down to his supervisor and was fired from a well-paying job as a brakeman on the Norfolk and Western [Railway] coal cars.  And he decided that he was going to become an entrepreneur, and always wanted to be one.  And he wanted to build a club.  So he and a friend put together what money they had.  They found a little building and built around it, a thing called the Combo Terrace [Chesapeake, Virginia], which was probably one of the most forward thinking clubs at that time in the area.  It was a nightclub.  It was an eatery.  It was a performance area.  He had Ruth Brown.  His theory was, he had a wall painted with iridescent, three-dimensional lighting on the wall, the characters come out.  And he, he brought in a singer, a comedian--no, a singer--the opening act was a hoochie coochie dancer, not a stripper, but a hoochie coochie dancer, a comic and then a singer.  And the place was packed.  There was so, I mean the business, I thought that summer that we were gonna be the wealthiest people in Virginia 'cause they--the business, just came out of nowhere.  Cars would park along and get, they just clogged up the highway trying to get in this club.  Well, right across the street was a rundown shack called Swing Inn [Chesapeake, Virginia].  It had been there for a long time, and it was a juke joint owned by a black gentleman.  And he was very angry that we had taken his business.  So he, having had some friends with the local sheriff, got together and conspired with the sheriff, who didn't like my father.  And they set him up.  They brought in some young kids.  They planted some corn liquor and before these kids got out of the building, the police, sheriff showed up and arrested.  To this day, it's the largest raid in the history of Virginia.  They backed the paddy wagons up, took about five paddy wagons to take everybody in the club to jail, including myself, my stepmother, my father.  It was over 128 people arrested that night.  And they couldn't convict, it was a setup and everybody knew it was a setup.  So they couldn't convict him on the, the corn liquor charge, the minor charge.  They convicted him on not having a five dollar dance license.  And my father regretted it.  He says, "Why didn't I think of that?  Why did I do the business?  Why didn't I go to business school?"  Well, it ruined him.  He lost the club 'cause he--without a whiskey, a drink license, he couldn't sell beer or wine.  What is a club?  And my father never really emotionally recovered from that.  And it just, I saw part of him just be destroyed.
Story_ID: 296830
Speaker 1: How long did it take for all this to transpire?  I mean about when did--
Speaker 2: Months, literally, at the height of the--when he--it took him [Reid's father, William Reid] about eight months, a year to build it [Combo Terrace, Chesapeake, Virginia], get it going.  Sixty--he started in '62 [1962].  Well, the summer of '63 [1963] was at its peak.  I mean it was just, it was the talk of this--people were coming down from Baltimore [Maryland], New York.  It was, it was nothing like.  I hadn't seen anything like it since until I got into the Playboy Clubs.  It was way before its time.  There was nothing like it in entertainment.  I don't even know where he got the idea from.  But it was an amazing club.  Well, when that went down in sixty--the summer, the latter part of '63 [1963], that fall, he couldn't do anything, lost his license.  It destroyed him.  I decided, well in August rather--go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that summer '63 [1963] is the summer of the March on Washington.  Were you getting ready to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was all part of--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So actually, I got, I was just thinking.  I got my months, I jumped ahead of myself.  This happened in the first part of the summer.  This happened in, they raided him in May, lost the club.  So we were arrested in May.  June was when, 'cause I was still in class [at Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia].  I graduated.  June things were bad for him.  I had to make a decision.  I was gonna join the [U.S.] Air Force to get out of town.  I hated this town because what had happened.  I wanted to get out of town.  My father, I could see what, the destruction of my father.  And I went to join the Air Force, and on the way to the Air Force, I got misdirected and ended up down at Virginia Beach [Virginia] helping somebody find a club.  And, and took a job as a waiter, never been a waiter, first time I ever worked for a white group.  And I made so much money as a waiter that first week or two, the guy says, "Well, if you go in the Air Force, you're gonna need some pocket change.  Work here for a month before you go."  So I did.  Well, I made so much money.  I had never dreamed that--I was making seven, eight hundred dollars a week in tips.  I was making more than faculty members.  So--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What you're saying--
Speaker 2: I was making a lot of money, man.  I had not--I had all this cash.  I didn't know what to do with all this cash.  I said, well, one day I, I was getting ready to get on the bus to go to work, and I saw this beautiful girl get on the bus.  And I went and sat next to her.  I said, "Young lady."  She said, "Stay away from me, you ain't nothing.  You ain't about nothing.  I don't wanna, why--you just a little hustler."  So I said, "Well, you don't know me."  So I followed her.  I stayed on the bus, and she got off in front of Norfolk State University [Norfolk State College, Norfolk, Virginia].  I got off the bus with her, still talking to her, walked into the, she walked--she said, "Leave me alone."  And she walked into the (laughter), what was then the Tidewater Hall [G.W.C. Brown Hall].  And I stopped, and I looked around, and I saw other beautiful women.  I'm going, what is this?  Where is this?  And I realized this was Norfolk State.  I'm saying all these pretty girls.  I need to be hanging out here.  So I went in and I enrolled, and I got in on probation.  My grades were so bad, they put me on probation.  And I enrolled.  I had the money.  I paid my tuition like, like literally, how much is it?  In cash, two hundred and some dollars, chip, chip, chip.  And I enrolled and started taking some classes.  And that's how I got in college, chasing this girl.  And I made money that summer, and then I got enrolled, I enrolled.  We started going to class early.  They started early in August, I forgot when it was.  Then I got involved in the Civil Rights Movement through a friend of mine who owned a barbershop.  And I'm sitting in the barbershop one day telling him about some of the classes and everything.  And he said, he said, "Why don't you ride up with me tonight?"  I said, "Where're you going?"  He said, "We're going up to Washington [D.C.]."  I said, "For what?"  He said, "Haven't you heard?  We're going up to the March on Washington."  I said, "Yeah, I'll ride with you."  He had a Austin-Healey 3000.  I'll never forget it.  He and his brother were sitting in the front.  I was curled up in the window of the back, and we drove up to the March on Washington.
Story_ID: 296831
Speaker 1: Now, I had been a militant.  I had been more into the Malcolm X, the, the Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] philosophy at that time.  And so I go up [to Washington, D.C. for the March on Washington].  We fall asleep.  We get there like predawn.  I fall asleep at the base of the Washington Monument [Washington, D.C.].  I'm awakened by Peter, Paul and Mary singing 'If I Had A Hammer,' and when I woke up I was surrounded by thongs of, you know, (laughter), I was just, more people than I ever, just more than I'd ever seen in my life in one place.  And I was, I just woke up and was taken immediately into this sort of strange alternate universe that I stayed in all of that day until finally I made my way in marching.  We got split up, all the three of us.  And I found myself marching at one point with Roy Wilkins, two rows behind [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  I found myself among the, I found myself standing and talking to Wilt Chamberlain.  I saw [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte.  I saw all these people that I'd never, you know, I heard about.  And then I found myself near the Tidal Basin [Washington, D.C.], and I climbed in a little tree right near there, and I watched the speech.  And those words, they did change my life.  I left there going, oh, man, this is--it was like an epiphany.  I said, this is serious.  This is, this is the future.  This is my future.  So I went back to school [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], and I resigned from the organization that SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] organization, a branch of SNCC.  And I went to, and joined the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] college chapter and later became its president (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, why did you resign from SNCC?
Speaker 1: I bought into Dr. King's philosophy.  I, I believed what he said, and I still do, and I think we have seen the, the, you know, we got so much negative information now, we forget that the dream has come true.  Our president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was judged by the character, by his character, not by the color of his skin.  That deals down.  And we need to accept that and move onto the next deal.  The next deal now is about character (laughter).  It ain't about race.  So I realized that he was right, came back and began to look at my life and, and civil rights in a whole different--got very active in civil rights and stayed active throughout my college career.
Story_ID: 296832
Speaker 1: You stayed involved with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] throughout your college [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Stayed with NAACP.  Then we staged our own marches.  We formed our own groups, SCAD [Student Committee Against Discrimination].  We stayed active.  We helped integrate, you know, we got attacked, and, you know, chased and, you know, the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] and death threats and all that stuff.  And then we, after Selma [Alabama], we realized that they had, the tactics had changed, and they were going to attack us.  So we then began to look for some allies.  And we went to Old Dominion [College; Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia], and there were a group, a Unitarian church group over there, and they--and we said, "Look, we're gonna march, we're gonna do a march after Selma, the next Sunday after Selma, and they've already threatened us.  And they're gonna have dogs and guns and everything else.  We'd like for you to join us," and we went to the faculty and said, "We want white members because they won't attack white people."  So I have a picture of that march in front of the post office.  And there were some young kids, some Jewish kids from well-to-do families in the neighborhood who joined.  And we became friends, and they were on point.  We put them on point.  And they didn't let the dogs loose on us that time.  And that was my first social involvement, and then we started having these meetings at the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this is something that took place--
Speaker 2: Here in Norfolk [Virginia].
Speaker 1: In Norfolk.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was a reaction to Selma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That following week, all over America, not just in Norfolk, there were these reactions.  See, you know, again, the story of civil rights is told through a few eyes.  But--
Speaker 1: So this is 1965, right?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965], yeah, '65 [1965].  Literally, the week and the weeks after Selma across this nation, there were marches in sympathy to what happened in Selma.  And we had one there that was, that was--that they didn't want.  They tried to stop.
Speaker 1: Now, did you go down to the Selma to Montgomery March?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't go there.  We did it here.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) here, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did it here, didn't go to that.  You see, you know, again, you didn't have to go far to find the problem or the solution (laughter).  We had our own problems right here.  So we did it here.  And, and it was very successful here.  I mean we integrated a lot--we, the group of us.
Story_ID: 296833
Speaker 1: In the local NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], I mean, did you have any interaction with [HistoryMaker] Oliver [W.] Hill or any of the other (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Only through, mostly, Oliver Hill, they were having their battles up here, but we would always interrelate.  We always knew what was going on, the grapevine.  It brings me to the gentleman who unheralded leader and should be talked about more was Dr. [William P.] Robinson, Sr., who was the first black since Reconstruction to be elected into the legislature here in the State of Virginia.  He was our political science teacher at Norfolk State [College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], a very powerful man.  He was the man, he and [Joseph A.] Jordan [Jr.], attorney Jordan, were the two that we would go to.  And they would, they would give us our instructions on how to deal with it, you know, what to do, what to look out for.  They were our mentors in the political movement at college, I'm saying.  And so he was my political mentor.  And he also happened to be Doug Wilder's [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder] political mentor.  That's what moved me back to the state.  When Doug ran for governor, I came back saying, you know what?  If this state is smart enough to elect the best man for the job, then I should live here because you couldn't get elected in California.  [Tom] Bradley could not get elected.  If a black man gets elected in Virginia, I need to be here because this is, this is a rapid part of change.   I know this state.  I was born in it.  So when he, he said, "I'll hold you to that."  So literally, on inauguration day, I was at his inauguration, and I also closed escrow on my farm in Charlottesville [Virginia].  So I lived up to my word and that's how it brought me back, was Doug, and because we had the same political mentor.  And I worked with him on his campaign.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you all were in school together at the same time?
Speaker 2: No, no, we were--he's, Doug's slightly older than I, but we had the same political mentor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so when he ran out of duty and respect for not only Doug, but for Dr. Robinson, I came back and worked in his campaign a little bit, traveled with him, you know, not a lot though, but some.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the president of Virginia State [College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] was Robert P. Daniel, right?
Speaker 2: At that, my president was, was, when I was there was Brooks, Lyman Beecher Brooks.
Speaker 1: Lyman Beecher Brooks.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, he was the man.  He didn't, he (laughter), he was a very serious individual.  That's all I can say.  We had utmost fear and respect for him (laughter).
Story_ID: 296834
Speaker 1: Did you know [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Wyatt Tee Walker here in--
Speaker 2: No, did not know him.  I mean knew of him, but I did not--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was up here in Richmond [Virginia] and with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, knew of him.  But I did meet and spend some time with Dr. King when he came to Norfolk [State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia].  At the time that--this was before I went to college.  In '61 [1961] or '62 [1962], I'm not sure of the year.  I think it was '61 [1961], I had gotten in some more trouble.  And my [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid] didn't know what--I think it was '60 [1960], probably '60 [1960], got in some trouble.  And my grandmother--and this time didn't wanna go to my father [William Reid].  So she went to the pastor at our church, New Calvary Baptist Church [Norfolk, Virginia], Reverend [Samuel A.] Wilson.  I will never forget him, one of the finest men I've ever met and a preacher who (unclear) and said, "You need to talk to this boy."  So for my grandmother to go to the preacher, you know I must have been bad.  So he brought, he brought me in and I sat in the church.  And I said, all right.  You know, back in those days, you respect, even if you wasn't gonna listen to it, you gonna respect it.  So I'm sitting there in the, and Reverend Wilson is looking at me.  And he says, "So, you're a tough kid.  You're a"--what do you call it, "delinquent.  You're gonna be a teenage delinquent."  And I'm sitting there, "No, sir."  He said, "No, no, no, I understand you're tough.  So you're tough.  I got a job for you since you're a tough guy."  He says, "I want you to be bodyguard for Dr. King who's coming to the church."  And I said, "What?"  He said, "Yeah, I want you to--two Sundays from now, I want you and I'm gonna pick another gentleman, and I want you guys to be his bodyguard for the whole day he's here."  I said, "All right," (laughter).  So that Sunday came, and it was me and another kid who was a very bright, very well--nice kid from a nice family who we became friends and me, this, the thug life, end up being--Dr. King comes in.  We're introduced to him.  "These young men are gonna mirror you the whole time you're in this church," and yada, yada, yada.  So we spent a day standing next to or walking around with Dr. King as his supposedly bodyguards.
Speaker 1: Oh, well, what year is this now?  You're still in high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is 1960.  Yeah, I'm still in high school.
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960], okay.
Speaker 2: And I will never forget, he was the first charismatic person I'd ever been in the company of.  I mean I'd never been around anybody with that kind charisma and well-spoken and stature, and I was like amazed at this guy.  And I took a picture of him.  I have a picture that I took of him, but we were his bodyguards.  And I will never forget it.  It was like, wow, and I listened to him, and I was like--and I started to begin to follow him except that I didn't like that sort of peaceful, lay down your hands and don't, you know, 'cause I come from a very rowdy family.  My thing is a man smack you, you smack him back.  So I didn't like that about it, but I liked him.  So then it was, you know, I, I followed more Malcolm X than I did him.  But I liked him, and he was the first real--so there was that dichotomy that stayed with me until '63 [1963].  And then when I went to the March on Washington and listened to that speech, I went, that's the man.  That's the guy.  He's the stalwart.  He's, he's the one that the character of which I buy into.  Until this day I believe that it's about character, and, and we need to rebuild the concept of character in our young people if we're gonna save this thing.  You know, it's gotta be about character.  It's not about race.  It's not about gender.  It's about character.
Story_ID: 296835
Speaker 1: In college at Norfolk State [College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], you majored in business, right?
Speaker 2: Business, because of my father [William Reid].  When my father said in front of me, "I wish I had known more about business."  I said, "If I do go to college, I'm gonna major in business."  So I majored in business administration and economics because of my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you do as a student?  Did you focus--
Speaker 2: First year I got--remember, I went in chasing girls.  So the first year was not good.  I was partying.  I pledged Pershing Rifles.  I was, I was working nights, drinking, and hanging out in speakeasies.  I didn't do well.  And they called me in, and they said, "Look, you're below two point."  I was like 1.95.  They said, "You've got"--I forgot how many, "You've got one semester, you can't even go here."  I mean this is the only college who would take me.  Said, "You can't even go here."  So I thought about it, and I didn't wanna leave.  I was actually--it seemed a safe place.  Remember, this is the beginning of the Vietnam [War] experience, the involvement in Vietnam, and I was looking at it going, man, I don't know if I wanna get caught up--things are getting ready to change here.  So I applied myself, picked my grades up, and I did, I think not a complete turnaround, but I began to improve.  Then I met a man or a man came to me actually.  I was out in the hallway talking to a young lady, trying to, you know, get her to see my way of life, and he heard me.  I was booming, I had the--it was early in the morning.  My voice was kind of deep, and he came out and said, "Young man, you're interrupting my class."  He said, "Who are you?"  I said, "My name is [HistoryMaker] Tim [Reid]."  He said, "Young lady, this man means you no good.  Go about your business," (laughter).  He says, "You have a very deep voice."  He said, "How are you ranked?"  I said, "I'm a sophomore."  He said, "Have you taken lit [literature]?"  He was a lit teacher, 10, 110 lit.  He said, "Have you taken lit?"  I said, "No, sir."  He said, "You know you have to come by me."  I said, "Yes, sir."  His name was Stanley Wilson.  He said, "Well, I'll tell you what.  I'm putting together a drama class, and I like your voice.  I want you to come read for a part."  I said, "I'm not interested."  He said, "If you're gonna take lit, you're interested.  Trust me on that," (laughter).  And so it was a threat.  So I said, "Yes, sir, I'll be there."  So that afternoon, I go to this audition, and I auditioned for this piece.  I have no interest in being an actor, and he says, "You're playing the part."  And I get this part.  In--the priest of Zeus in 'Oedipus Rex' [Sophocles] (laughter).  And I have so much fun in rehearsal, again, a lot of girls.  And he then says--we didn't have a drama class, a drama program at Norfolk State, he said, "I wanna create a drama program.  I want you guys to be my base.  So we're gonna do some electives."  So we took improvisation as an elective.  We took makeup and design.  Electives, just stuff that he threw together.  And out of it now exists at Norfolk State the mass communication and drama department.  But we started it, did a few plays.  But then I got married [to Rita Sykes] my junior year, had a child, got married.
Story_ID: 296836
Speaker 1: So I had to drop out 'cause I had to feed my family, and I was carrying a lot of classes.  And it was my junior year that DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company] came through.  It was after the civil--this is now '65 [1965]. Civil Rights Movement has happened.  The civil rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964] has been passed.  So white corporations now have, by law, beginning to come to historically black colleges [and universities (HBCUs)] to do sort of quasi recruitment.  And DuPont sent a, sent some man down to Norfolk State [College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] to recruit.  And nobody took them seriously.  Again, we're like, these white kids ain't, you got coming, they ain't gonna hire us, you know, to heck with 'em.  So nobody really took it seriously then.  Well, I was the head of the internship program for my business class.  And so it was my job to, here I am again, shuffling somebody around, being their escort.  I couldn't get anybody to come.  None of the seniors wanted to talk to DuPont, like, "DuPont, that racist, ah, I'm not."  So finally the young kid was so scared.  He was a young white boy, his first job.  And he has to go to a black college.  He was so scared.  So I calmed him down, and so when it was all over, and he was getting ready to leave, he said, you know, "I only have like, I only have one person.  Would you like to come up to Wilmington [Delaware]," and he said, "Oh, it's just a free trip."  I had never been on a plane.  I had never been on--I'd never stayed in a hotel in my life, you know.  I said, yeah, free trip to Wilmington, yeah, I'll do it.  So he wrote it down.  And about four weeks later, I get this invite to come up and to be looked at.
Speaker 2: This is Wilmington--
Speaker 1: Delaware.
Speaker 2: Delaware, okay.
Speaker 1: DuPont (unclear).  So I said, "Yeah, I'll do it."  So I'm doing a play ['Oedipus Rex,' Sophocles].  I finished the play that night, jump on a train.  I can't fly.  I go up to Wilmington, and I stay in the DuPont Hotel [Hotel du Pont, Wilmington, Delaware], first time I'd ever lived in a, stayed in a hotel.  And I auditioned--I auditioned?  I was interviewed for a potential job at DuPont.  I was loose as a goose.  I'm a junior in college.  I don't care.  So I was really loose.  And I went around.  I had nothing to fear, don't need a job 'cause I can't get out anyway.  Well, lo and behold a few weeks later after I got back, I got a job offer from DuPont in my junior year.  And all I had to do was graduate, and I'd become the first black hired by DuPont in management.  And that's what I--that's how it happened.  And because of my photographic background that stayed with me, they put me in the photo products department, which got me in Chicago [Illinois], which got me into show business (laughter).  So, you know, my life is a series of accidents (laughter), following instincts, you know, just doing what comes.
Story_ID: 296837
Speaker 1: You graduated [from Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] in '68 [1968], is that right?
Speaker 2: No, I graduated in--yeah, '68 [1968], January of '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was a four and a half. I changed my major, and I had to, I stayed a half a semester.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated and then were you in Chicago [Illinois] when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed or were you--
Speaker 2: No, I was on my way to Chicago.  I literally, I was in training for DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company].  I graduated in '68 [1968] January.  I graduated on a Friday and Monday I was working full time for DuPont.  And we went in training at Rochester [New York], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Wilmington [Delaware].  And then they had to decide where to send me.  I was the only black in a graduating group--I mean a group of fourteen college students from Stanford [University, Stanford, California], big colleges, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] and the little black kid from Norfolk [Virginia] division of Virginia State College [Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].  And out of that fourteen, twelve were offered jobs, continuing jobs, and I was chosen.  But they didn't know where to put me.  They couldn't put me in the South because of racism.  They couldn't put me in Detroit [Michigan] because I'd be calling on the auto industry.  And they, I remember the guy saying, said, "Well, we couldn't send you to California," 'cause somebody said, "He goes to California, he's gonna go in show business."  So they sent me to Chicago, and what do I do?  Go into show business (laughter).  So they sent me to Chicago and that's how I got to Chicago.  And I arrived in Chicago two days after the assassination, and when I arrived, it was a riot, the day after the riots.  The city was in flames.  [U.S.] military people were riding around in jeeps, and I watched the city blaze from my hotel window.  So it was, that was the final twist in my Dr. King evolution from a kid, '63 [1963] and then sort of the, the culmination of the dream that he spoke of, I'm a recipient of it.  And here I am now being the first black hired, and he's now gone.  So politically, that--that was a bad year for me, '68 [1968] in many ways.  It was the, Dr. King.  It was the Democratic [National] Convention [DNC], [Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy.  All the things that held me together politically, my father [William Reid] was a delegate, an alternate delegate in the '68 [1968] convention.  I was literally in traffic.  They fought on the hood of my car the night of the riot of '68 [1968].  Literally, I was taking my father to the convention center at McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois].  And we had gotten to it, and they wouldn't let us in, and they start fighting.  Now, we're sitting in the car watching the riot on the hood of my car.
Story_ID: 291418
Speaker 1: So August, 1968, you're in Chicago [Illinois], Democratic National Convention [DNC], and riots going on.
Speaker 2: Riots going on.  They're fighting on the hood of my car 'cause I'm trying to get my dad [William Reid] down into the, the receiving area of the McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois] so he can go to the convention.  He's looking at it.  I'm looking at it.  They're clubbing people, horses.  And I'm going like, my God.  And we finally--they make a way for us.  We go in, and I drop him off.  And I have to leave.  I can't stay.  And I go back home, and I watch it on the news.  And that really bothered me, I mean--
Speaker 1: Where were you living in Chicago?
Speaker 2: I was living in a place called Markham, Illinois.  You know, working with DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company], I had, you know--my life, as I say, I feel like a Charles Dickens character because I graduate [from Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] on a Friday.  I'm living in the projects.  My son [Timothy Reid II], my wife [Rita Sykes Reid] and my mother [Augustine Wilkins] are living in a four-room apartment in the projects, chasing roaches, depending on whose got the Raid that whether they're coming, going.  And I move from that.  In April, when I arrive in Chicago, a few days after the assassination of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], I move into a quarter acre house, I mean a house on a quarter acre with a garage.  So the first house I ever lived in--
Speaker 1: And this is in Markham, Illinois.
Speaker 2: This is Markham, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a suburb of--
Speaker 2: Of Chicago, Illinois, it's South Side.
Speaker 1: It would be considered a Chicago black suburb.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, definitely at that time, Markham was, oh, yeah, definitely.  Harvey [Illinois] was multiracial, but Markham was a black community.  And I move into this black community, I mean this--and well, it was a little integrated then, but not--the whites were moving out.  The [white] flight was happening.  But I bought this nice little house, a little ranch house, first house I ever bought.  It cost me $15,300, I never will forget it.  I had a company car.  I had my own car and a garage.  And I remember taking, I was so enamored, remember I watched 'Leave it to Beaver' and all that stuff, I went and had my initials put on the front of the garage, the R.  I will never forget that.  And it was in a cul-de-sac.
Story_ID: 291419
Speaker 1: So I go back to my house.  My [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid], my grandmother who, who, again, I adore, she had--I wanted her to see my first house, said, "Grandma, you gotta come see my first house."  She said, "Junior, baby, I--that's a long way."  I said, "Well, grandma, you'll fly."  She said, "Oh, I'm not getting on no airplane."  She said, "I'll take the bus."  I said, "Grandma, you don't wanna take the bus.  It's sixteen hours."  She said, I'll take the bus, baby, for you."  So my grandma got on the bus and took the Greyhound bus all the way from Norfolk [Virginia] for twenty-some hours on the bus.  She got off, when she got off, her wig was crooked.  Her hat, her feet are swollen, (laughter) and she said, "Come on, baby, take me, take me."  So I get her in the car, and I said, "All right, grandma, I'm taking you to see my house."  She said, "Before you go, baby, I want you to take me here."  My grandmother loved National Enquirer back in the day when it was, "Baby born with two heads," "Man kills," you know, "self" (laughter), just they had the worst headlines.  She used to buy, I had to go get her a can of Society [Sweet] Snuff, a Midnight magazine--newspaper, and the National Enquirer.  She read them, and so she said, "I gotta go here."  I said, "Where, Grandma?"  She said, "Take me here."  I looked at it.  It was where Richard Speck lived.  Now, I don't know if you remember Richard Speck.  He was a mass murderer.  She had read about it.  And she said, "I wanna go here."  I said, "Where?"  She said, "This address."  And she had a picture of it in the National Enquirer.  So I drive the way; she said, "Look, see right up there, that window.  Count down.  That's where he lived."  I said, "Who?"  She said, "Richard Speck."  She said, "Now take me here."  I said, "Where, Grandma?"  She said, "Here."  (Laughter) So I take her over to the University of Illinois med [medical] center [University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois].  She said, "See that apartment?  That's where he killed her."  She had the whole history of Richard Speck she had been reading in the National Enquirer.  So after I took her to all these places, like three places she wanted to go.  She said, "All right, I've seen that, you can take me home, take me to your house."  So I take her to my house, I show her my first house.  And she looks at it.  She said, "I can't--baby, you've done it.  This is your first house."  And she had--she stayed a few days.  She went back.  And she never came again and died before she came again, before I moved to the other house.
Speaker 2: Now, did your wife [Rita Sykes Reid] and your mother [Augustine Wilkins] live with you in Harvey [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: No, not in Harvey--
Speaker 2: In Markham [Illinois].
Speaker 1: When I left the projects, I didn't wanna, you know, this was the first house with my, with my wife and my kid [Timothy Reid II].  And I said, "I gotta start a life.  Ma, I'm gonna get you a place."  So I got my mother an apartment.  She stayed in Norfolk.  I got her an apartment, took care of her, but she stayed in Norfolk.  And then I took my family and then moved to Illinois--
Story_ID: 291420
Speaker 1: So you had a son [Timothy Reid II] by that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had a son.  Had my son, yeah, he was four years old--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when, at that time.  And so moved to Chicago [Illinois].  I gave up politics.  When they killed [Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy, I said, that's it.  I'm through with political life.  The boring '70s [1970s] and [President] Richard [Milhous] Nixon and all, I said, I'm through.  I'm not gonna involved with this anymore.  I'm a businessman.  That's what I'll be.  So I didn't vote.  I didn't do anything for a long time.  I'd just had enough.  I, the Civil Rights Movement, everything.  I said, I'm through.  And then I got involved with Tom Dreesen, we became a comedy team, first American--black American--first black and white comedy team in the history of America, not the last.
Speaker 1: Now, did you meet Tom Dreesen at work [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont)] or--
Speaker 2: I met Tom Dreesen, yes, in a work situation.  I joined the Jaycees, [United States] Junior Chamber of commerce because that's part of your job.  You know you wanna get local community involvement so I joined the Jaycees and he was in there.  And he proposed a program to go to elementary schools to talk about the ills of drug abuse.  It was just beginning to break into the white neighborhood.  And he says, "I need volunteers," and I volunteered.  And he said, "I'm sorry I don't need anybody else, but"--I said, "Well, you should know, I know a little bit about drugs from my stepfather [George Bright] was a heroin addict, and I've seen the"--I said, "I know a little bit about what goes on in the community."  He says, "I know, but I'm sorry, I've gotten everybody."  Next day I get a call from him.  The guy dropped out, got a job, couldn't do it.
Story_ID: 291421
Speaker 1: So I joined him [Tom Dreesen], and we went to these schools talking about our understanding and the problems of drug abuse.  And the kids, we used to use humor because we both came from the streets, and kids used to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, what was Tom Dreesen's background?
Speaker 1: Street, poor kid.  I thought I was poor.  He was the poorest white man I ever met in my life (laughter).  His life was just--I thought I was bad.  His life was just unbelievably bad.  I mean, again, we're two kids came out of a [Charles] Dickens novel.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I read he grew up on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: South Side.
Speaker 2: --and then he grew up in Bridgeport [Chicago, Illinois] or--
Speaker 1: He lived, no, no, he grew up in Harvey, Illinois.  But he lived in the black neighborhood 'cause his family was that poor.  I mean they didn't want to (laughter).  It just was no other place for 'em.  They lived in a shack.  I mean it was just--his life story is unbelievable, and so when we got together, he actually knew more about the black community in, in Illinois than I did.  I mean he had black friends and everything.  And he was a really interesting kid, out of the [U.S.] Navy, had been to Norfolk [Virginia] through the Navy and everything.  And he was my first white friend, I mean friend, I mean partner, friend.  He's the first one.  I'd never had a white friend.  It was very interesting and unique to me.  He was a odd bird 'cause I didn't know how to peg him.  I didn't know, you know, he wasn't like white people I'd met before.  I mean I couldn't use the same game on him, you know.  He could talk trash as quick as I could talk trash.  It was really interesting.  So we decided to listen to this young girl one day who said, "You guys are funny.  You ought to be a comedy team."  And we decided to try it, and he and I went out and met some, some unbelievable resistance, fights, attacks.  We traveled the nation trying to, trying to show America that a black man and a white man could carry on in a humorous way, of life and get along and this could be a way.  And it didn't work.  America did not wanna hear it.
Speaker 2: Now, there's been a book ['Tim and Tom: An American Comedy in Black and White,' Tim Reid, Tom Dreesen and Ron Rapoport] written about this now, I know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a book.
Speaker 2: --and there's talk about doing a movie about it, I think.
Speaker 1: Movie script.  I'm gonna see the script in another month, and hopefully, they'll go before the cameras in Chicago [Illinois] this summer.
Speaker 2: But it is an evolution to Tim and Tom.  You start, you know, as you said, performing in the schools--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and you start getting laughter, I guess, from the kids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We started getting laughs--we were actually funny at times.  It took us a while to get an act, but once we got the act, we were, we were funny, and we made people laugh, both black people and white people.  It's always a little iffy when they were together, but remember, we worked the chitterling circuits [Chitlin' Circuit], segregated audiences being all black, segregated audience being all white.  We worked before Polish conventions.  We worked before, we worked, we worked at the first Black Expo [Black Business Exposition], believe it or not.  And we followed Stevie Wonder.  We worked there again and followed Howling Wolf [Howlin' Wolf].
Story_ID: 291422
Speaker 1: We [Reid and Tom Dreesen] opened for, you name it, blues artists.  We became friends with the Chicago [Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did you get the courage to start, you know, as an act?  I mean I'm sorry, I didn't wanna interrupt you--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it--
Speaker 2: --'cause you got this good job with DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the people in the community would say, "That's a good job."
Speaker 1: Not only did they say it was good, they thought I was crazy.  My father [William Reid] was like, "Are you insane?"  I mean what are you doing?  I mean I'm making more money than I ever dreamed and, you know, and back in the day, in college, kids used to sit around and say one day we'll be making $10,000 a year.  I mean when you say, that don't seem much, but remember, my first house only $15,300.  You could buy a car for $2,200 brand new.  The [Ford] Mustang only cost $2,400, my first Mustang.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess the salary in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so $10,000 a year.
Speaker 2: --of a man who worked in a factory, a General Motors [Company] plant, would have been about $150 a week.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is, yeah, this is not, you know, this is the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].  Ten thousand [dollars] was a lot of money.  So for me to graduate from college [Norfolk State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], my first year's salary was $6,500, I think I was making right out of college.  Well, prior to that, I don't think I made $1,500 that year.  So I went from, you talking about high cotton, I went from the projects and roaches, to a house with my initials on the garage and a quarter acre land.  I was, I had a $600 a month expense account and a company car.  I mean I was wealthy beyond belief.  I had, everything I had dreamed of happened in a span of six months.  I went from, not abject poverty, but from very difficult struggle.  Four of us living in a four-room apartment to three-bedroom house, garage, quarter--half quarter acre land.  It was cultural shock, you know, and I'm driving around the--I covered three states for DuPont.  I've got an expense account.  I've got like, wow, it happened.
Story_ID: 291423
Speaker 1: Did you see a path of upward mobility at DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was no question that they expected me to be a major executive in the company at DuPont.  I mean they, they--I was an experiment.  And I was told that I was an experiment.  And I was the first.  And there are people that work at DuPont, I've got a little legendary history there of being the first.  And it was difficult at times.  It was strange.  The chairman of the board knew me, du Pont knew me.  One of the family members, Pierre [S.] du Pont [IV] was in the office.  So I was known in the company.  I was an experiment, and everybody said, you're the spook who sits by the door here.  And everything you do--I remember my, P. P. Atteske [ph.], crazy Russian Jew, I loved this man dearly, he was my sales manager.  And he would call me in.  And he said, "[HistoryMaker] Tim [Reid], let me tell you something."  He says, "I've got eleven of you under me.  He said, "When they send me"--I had to send in safety reports, monthly reports, expense reports and daily reports on my territory, and I covered parts of three states.  He said, "When everybody sends me their stuff, I look at it, I make a report of their stuff, and I send it off to Wilmington [Delaware]."  He said, "Except yours."  He said, "Everything you send me goes in a separate folder to the chairman of the board."  He said, "Dot every," you know, "every I, cross every T, everything you send goes there.  Know that.  And I'm telling you that because," you know, well, he was in this country, his family coming over from Germany.  He says, "I want you to know, yes, you gotta be twice as good.  Now, it may piss you off, but that's, that's the fact."  I said, "I understand that, Peter."  I come from that.  I knew I had to be twice as good.  He said, "Well, I just wanted you to know."  He said, "I got your back the best I can."  He said, "But you--everything you do, everything goes straight to the board."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was like all right.  I'm used to pressure.  I was born in pressure.  This is, this is (laughter) nothing.  And that's what we did, so, and I--because of that though, the bad news is, it was that pressure.  The good news is that because of that everything I did well also got noticed, so I accelerated quite quickly.  I mean I got raises.  I was birddog of the month.  I was, you know, everything I did they were taking notice of.  So it was like, they didn't expect me to do anything, let alone achieve any measure of success in my field.
Story_ID: 291424
Speaker 1: So when you first, you know, ventured out as a professional entertainer, did you make enough money that it was a lure that, oh, this is--
Speaker 2: No. You know, it's an interesting thing, I--Tom [Dreesen], Tom had, was not as successful.  He was an insurance man and was not doing well.  And when we fell in love with show business, he went whole hog.  I'm, because of my background, a survivor, so I'm like, yeah, okay, I got the company --we're using my company car to drive all over the country.  I'm saying like, "Hey, man, I got an expense--I ain't killing this."  So I didn't truly commit a hundred percent to that.
Speaker 1: But you all had gigs in different--
Speaker 2: We had gigs and I was stealing time.  And we had gone all the way to New York [New York], and we had done 'The David Frost Show.'  In those days, it didn't air for weeks, months.  And I'm thinking, if these people at DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company] see me on 'The David Frost Show,' oh my God, I mean somebody's gonna see it.  So I've got a dilemma now.  Do I quit?  Do I tell them?  What do I do?  And I remember a guy who I did not particularly care for as a person, but he was helping us out a little bit.  One day we were rehearsing, and I was kind of half-ass rehearsing.  And he says, "[HistoryMaker] Tim [Reid], this is not gonna work."  I said, "Why?"  He said, "Tom is committed in everything.  His whole future relies on whether this thing works."  I said, "Yeah, he gave--he's this," I said, "but I got a family to feed.  What are you telling me?"  He says, "You gotta quit your job."  I said, "You must be insane.  I'm making $10,000 a year, I got a house, I got two kids [Tori Reid and Timothy Reid II] now, and you want me to quit this to chase something that so far, I don't think I've made a thousand dollars in the two years we've been together or three years we'd been together.  I don't think we made a thousand dollars."  I said, "It's costing me money.  You want me to quit?  I'm keeping this dude alive sometimes.  I'm paying our bills."  He said, "Tim, I'm just telling you about show business.  Unless you're giving a hundred percent"--I hated this guy.  I was so mad with him, but he was right.  So I said, "You know what?  What am I gonna do?"  So I go to talk to my sales--not, not Pete [P. P. Atteske (ph.)].  Pete had, they had moved Pete.  He had been promoted, and I had a new sales manager.  His name was [John H.] "Jack" Boyce.  I will never forget it.  Jack Boyce was a handsome guy, looked like Sean Connery, and he was a rugged looking guy and nice guy, too, very easy going.  So I went in his office to break the news to him that I'm gonna leave the company.  And as I'm talking to him--I hadn't told him yet, and we're talking.  And I look on his desk, and he has a picture of himself playing the guitar.  And I looked, and I said, "Jack, what's that?"  He said, "Oh, yeah, man, that's a"--he said, "I used to be a performer."  I said, "On what?"  He said, "Well, I was a folk singer."  He said, "You know what, I was on the 'Hootenanny.'"  Well, the 'Hootenanny' used to be a show that was like, just before 'The Midnight Special,' it was a national show, that Donavan [ph.] and a bunch of people had been on it.  I said, "You were on the 'Hootenanny'?"  He said, "Yeah, I was on the 'Hootenanny,'" and then all of a sudden, he forgot that I was in the room for a minute, and he went to that place we go when we go into our fantasies.  And he says, "You know, I've often wondered what my life would be like had I stayed with that."  I looked at him, and I said, "I don't ever wanna say that.  That ain't the nature of my family.  That ain't the nature of the people I come from," (laughter).  None of my family members from Rufus [ph.] to (laughter) to Grandma Beulah [Reid], has ever said, "I wonder what would have been."  They've always gone for it.  I looked at him, I said, "Jack, I'm leaving the company."  He said, "What do you mean?"  It shocked him.  I said, "I'm leaving the company."  He said, "To do what?"  I said, "I'm going into show business."  He said, "You can't.  This is insane."  He said, "Do you know what they're planning for you," dah, dah, dah, dah.  I said, "Jack, I'm leaving the company."  He said, "Well, at least let me, don't, give me a minute.  Let me talk to, let me call Wilmington [Delaware]."  So I--you got--I'm leaving the company.  So he called Wilmington.  I get a call from, from the DuPont corporate office, and they said, "Young man, we've invested a lot of time and effort in you and we believe in you.  Is it the photo products department?"  He said--this is a true story, he says, "Where would you like to be?  Pick, where would you like to be?  We have companies, I mean we have departments and stuff, divisions all over the world.  Would you like to go abroad?  Pick it."  I said, "No, sir, I'm going into show business," and I left the company and starved for four years (laughter).
Story_ID: 291425
Speaker 1: What did your wife say about this and what kind of discussion did--
Speaker 2: You know, my wonderful wife, my first wife, Rita [Sykes Reid], she was just the wife, the woman I needed in my life.  Rita believed in me.  If I came home and said, "Rita, I'm gonna become an astronaut," she'd pack me a lunch.  She'd say, "When does it take off?"  She just accepted and went along with my dream.  She accepted me as a dreamer.  Any other person, it would have been very difficult.  That part I, I owe her.  She, in other words, I didn't worry about that part of it, you know.  The people who gave me the most flack were my, my father [William Reid] and friends, thought I was crazy.  They said, "Man, you giving up," you know--and then I even got the, the race thing.  "You don't know what you're doing to our people.  You're one of the rare.  You can't let us down," and, oh, man, it was, you know.  But my, my first wife and my father-in-law [David Sykes] who had wanted to be a drummer, the two of them stuck by me.  But I was gonna make the decision one way or the other.  And it eventually ruined my marriage--well, not it ruined my marriage, I ruined my marriage.  I can't blame the experience.  I ruined my marriage, but I don't know.  You know, I tell young people who wanna go into show business and who have dreams that--there are sacrifices.  I mean there's something about passion and dreams that, in order to achieve them, you have to lose things.  You have to give up things.  You can't have it both--as my [paternal] grandma [Beulah Reid] says, "You can't eat your cake and have it, too."  And when you make the commitment to follow a dream, something will suffer.  There, there are consequences, and you've gotta be willing to accept those consequences.  Most people aren't.  And if you're not willing to accept the consequences, you should think twice about what it is you're going to, you know, jump out there.  And I was willing, again, based on my background, I had the survival instincts that no matter what I do, I'll survive.  So I took the plunge.  And it wasn't easy.  Boy, it was--we didn't make any money for a long time.  But I took the plunge in '71 [1971].  I didn't make any money in show business until '78 [1978].  I struggled, but now, here's again, that survival instinct, what I learned from my grandmother.  Back in the day when I was making money, I read a book during the Dixon--[President Richard Milhous] Nixon administration.  It was called how to ['How You Can] Profit from the Coming Devaluation' by Harry Browne.  And in there, he laid out a formula.  He says, they're gonna devalue the dollar.  And sure enough, a year or so later, Nixon devalued the dollar.  We've forgotten that.  You know, the country was in all kinds of problems.  He said, you need to buy gold.  You need to buy some gold stock.  Well, gold was selling for thirty-five dollars an ounce.  He said, set aside $10,000 or $5,000, and he gave this program of doing it.  I followed this program with about five grand [$5,000].  I bought some gold coins, bought some gold stock, home stake, and I didn't do the other thing, which was to get an offshore bank account.  I wish I had done it, but I didn't 'cause now it's too late to try.  But I wish I had that.  That's the only thing I didn't do.  And I did everything.  I got my passport.  I did all the things that he suggested.  Well, lo and behold, when the stuff hit the fan, gold shot up to twenty--two hundred and some dollars an ounce to $500 an ounce.  I bought it was $35, $65 an ounce.  So when I was in California, and things got tough and my rent was due and my car note was due and I had to send money to my, my ex-wife for the kids [Tori Reid and Timothy Reid II], I wasn't working.  I'd walk into a coin store, lay a coin down on the counter, and the guy would give me $270.  I'd pay my car note, my rent, and I'd send fifty to a hundred dollars back home.  That's how I survived for at least a year, year and a half.  And so, you know, again, that preparation, that street survival that I learned from my grandmother and from living in there, gave me the opportunity to survive.

Speaker 1: From what I have here, Tim and Tom [HistoryMaker Tim Reid and Tom Dreesen] toured from '71 [1971] to '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: No actually, we toured from '69 [1969] to '75 [1975] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were together for six years.
Speaker 1: Okay, '69 [1969] to '75 [1975].  Now, what happened?  Well, how did you all end up breaking up?  I know that [Dean] Martin and [Jerry] Lewis broke up, all the acts break up, but--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) There are literally three stories being told about the breakup of Tim and Tom, one by a very bitter guy who was our manager briefly, who thinks he knows.  I didn't particularly get along too well with him, but he thinks he knows.  But he was only there with us at certain places.  The only two people who know are the two who were there all the time.  That's Tom and I.  Tom's version is my relationship with Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett] and what she exposed me to were, was the reason that I left.  My version is I learned so much from Della Reese.  She's, she was not only what I needed, I know I would not have moved as rapidly and been as successful had not I not spent about a year with her.  She taught me a part of the business that few people get an opportunity to learn, not the business of how to perform, how to do this.  She taught me how to deal with your life in the down times.  You see, most survive--most entertainers are destroyed not by their work time, but by their down time, what they do in between the work.  She taught me how to survive in between the work.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you meet Della Reese and what--
Speaker 2: Well, Della was, we were--when Tom and I were struggling, we would always work around Chicago [Illinois], Mister Kelly's, one of the finest clubs in the history of show business.  And we became sort of their fill-in act, whenever somebody would drop out or whenever they needed somebody to cover in their--like if they had to pay a lot of money to the mainliner, they didn't have much money for the second act.  So they always had a comic and a singer or a singer, depending on who the star was.  So when Della came to town, we were asked to come and be her opening act at Mister Kelly's and we did.  And we were quite funny that night, and their manager, Lee Magid asked us if we'd be interested in him managing us and working with Della.  So we said, "Yeah."  So we signed.  We met Della that night.  We opened for her, and strangely enough, we don't talk about this too much in the book ['Tim and Tom: An American Comedy in Black and White,' Tim Reid, Tom Dreesen and Ron Rapoport], but Della and Tom were actually an item, briefly.  They didn't, Tom didn't, couldn't deal with it.  But they started, she started off, she was more interested in Tom, not me.  And we had nothing, nothing romantically or anything.  For the most part of the early part, we were, she was a wonderful friend.  And I came to California, went up to her place.  I stayed at her place, and nothing.  It was way later that I was, I, I really fell in love with Della, not so much--well, in addition to fell in love with who she was, it was that the woman was uncanny.  She had that sense of, of show business and style that, not only I needed, but I admired in people like Sammy Davis [Jr.] and Sarah Vaughan.  And you know, we worked with Count Basie and Erroll Garner--that sense of show business, that legend and history of show business that's missing from so many performers now.  And to be around that, it is not only enticing, it's, it's what show business is about.  So I was, I just fell in love with that, with her.  I traveled with her.  She took me to South Africa for--I opened for her in South Africa.  I became the first black American comic to work in South Africa.
Speaker 1: Now, did you open as a single act?
Speaker 2: As a single act, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 291427
Speaker 1: And yes, she [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett] thought, this is what she thought, and I certainly didn't argue with her, she thought that I was funnier than Tom [Dreesen], and that I had more comic ability than Tom.  And she said, "You should be a single--you'll do better as a single," 'cause black comics were doing better as a single then.  That was her thought.  She didn't tell me, leave Tom.  She just said, "This is what I think."  And, and in, in my own egotistical way, I thought that I was funnier than Tom.  It turns out, I'm not and wasn't.  Tom was funnier, and why he was funnier is because he understood and studied comedy.  He knew how to, how to deliver in the style of comedy that is, that works.  I mean it works in a sense that is the tried and true formula.  I'm a storyteller.  I mean, I, I take too long to get to the punch line.  Tom is boom, boom, boom, boom.  He has you, much funnier than I am.  I'm a better actor than Tom because my nature is improvisational, my nature is, you know, I'm better at my, my body and my mind can work together in an imaginary situation.  But he was a better comic.  And in the book ['Tim and Tom: An American Comedy in Black and White,' Tim Reid, Tom Dreesen and Ron Rapoport], it talks about a night that he went on 'The Johnny Carson Show' [sic. 'The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'].  I'm laying in the bed with Della, and we're watching him on 'The Johnny Carson Show'.  He kills.  I mean he is so funny, and Johnny picks him up and everybody sits down.  He sits on the couch, and I'm sitting there, and I'm going, oh my God.  Well, in the book it talks about what he thought when it was over.  He cried.  I cried.  He cried because he said to himself, "It should have been us."  That's what we had dreamed of.  But it happened to him and his career took off.  I sat there and cried because of my own arrogance, and I was sitting there, and I remember looking at her, and she was, she was for me, not for her, for me, she goes, "Oh, he wasn't that funny."  I went, "Yes, he was.  He killed.  He killed."  And it was a pivotal moment in both of our lives, for him as for me.  That's when I realized, wait a minute, [HistoryMaker] Tim [Reid].  You're a survivor, you've got to kick it up a notch.  You've got to turn your life around.  You didn't come here to lay up in Bel-Air [Los Angeles, California].  You didn't come here to--this isn't about, you know, you got not only a family to support, you are a survivor.  Get it together.  And I start building my life and my career after that, and it's been ever since, successful.
Speaker 2: Okay, we're gonna pause here for a second.
Speaker 1: But that was a pivotal point for both of us.
Story_ID: 291428
Speaker 1: When I first read about you and Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett], I was thinking like what was the age gap between you and Della Reese?  I know she's much older than you, but I can't--I don't--
Speaker 2: Della was fourteen years my senior.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was, I guess you'd call her a cougar in her day (laughter).  But Della Reese is, is the last of the breed of, of female singers, and I met quite a few of 'em through Della.  I became quite close with Carmen McRae and these women of that era, fascinating.  You know, I learned so much about show business from Della.  I learned so much about women of that era, singers in particular.  And it's a unique story.  You know, a lot of them were criticized for, like Lena [Horne] and [HistoryMaker] Diahann Caroll and on and on for marrying white men or, or being with white men as opposed to--and not all marrying.  Dorothy Dandridge, all of them.  But being with them and the social setting and spending time, sitting down with Carmen McRae who I adored, wonderful woman, you get their side.  It's a unique side.  And their side, Dinah Washington and on, all these women, you see, show business is a really interesting and powerful medium.  I mean it is the propaganda of our age.  I mean it's--it puts you in a world that it takes you on a level, an artificial world.  It's a fantasy world.  I mean people treat you like you're (unclear).  You know, they move about you.  But they also use you.  You know, it's like you're a pawn on this table of power, and they use you.  They, they bring you out and they parade you in front of people, and they decide who's gonna be--where you're gonna be, who you're gonna see.  So they control your life.  So what happens is, is it's a power vacuum that's created, and you're put in.  So here are these women that are being adored in [Las] Vegas [Nevada] and the clubs and these--every man, you know, back in the day, white men liked to change their luck as we used to say in the old days.  They wanted to be around this sort of brown sugar.  Well, black men coming up from the era, my father's [William Reid] era, were always back door.  I mean they were always looked upon as the problem.  They were always, you know, put in the various--but the black woman was allowed indoors.  She was, she was allowed closer in than the black man and we, that's the way it was used against us.  Now, you think show business.  These black men, a lot of them took issue with the fact that these black women that loved them had this world that they couldn't go in.  So they held it against them in many ways.  So they had to break 'em, you know, a black man's thing was I have to break 'em.  So they would try to break these women.  They would try to control these women and Dorothy Dandridge, and in many cases like Dorothy Dandridge, would ruin these women, I mean in terms of that dichotomy where they wanted to be.  So many of them said, to hell with that.  I'm gonna do it my world.  Della was one of the few women that I met of that era who was able to work both worlds.  She was able to, she, she was a lot stronger, which is proved by her longevity.  She had that street wisdom that I learned in my [paternal] grandmother's [Beulah Reid] and my Aunt Belle's house.  She was that black woman who could out think and outsmart any man if she chose to.  But she also loved me, so she wasn't as bitter in her relationships, although a lot of men worked over her.  She worked over a few, too.  So it was more of a, she, she fit more of the model of black woman that I grew up knowing, the strong, the, the maneuverable, the smart, the intellectual, but also talented and attractive, you know.  She, she's from the old school, and I understood that.  But I also had an understanding of people like Carmen and these other, Gail Fishers [Gail Fisher] and these other women.  And it's an interesting--somebody should write about, a book about it.  It's an interesting world that they were living in, and still to this day, I think, in some of them.  But, Halle Berry is a modern-day version of that.  And you can see how her life, the black men in her life abused and, and, you know, everything from physically to emotionally, and then, you know, so she's--I feel her, her dichotomy 'cause I've known it.  So not that it's an exact model, but I understand that model.  We've seen it in Lena Horne, we've seen it in Dorothy Dandridge.  We've seen it.  They call it sometimes the tragic mulatto in the, when they are fair.  But it happened to them, whether they were fair or not.  That seems to be what was happening.  And Della taught me that.  I was able to see that through her and learn about that.  Gave me a different perspective of the business.
Story_ID: 291429
Speaker 1: Now, your marriage broke up, but was it--did your wife [Rita Sykes Reid] go on the trips with you or did she, I mean was there, what was the cause of that--
Speaker 2: No, my marriage broke up because of me.  My marriage broke up because of what I wanted and, and in terms of my life and I just felt that in order to achieve what I wanted to achieve, I had to be alone and free to maneuver and, and go and do some of the things that I felt I had missed in growing up.  I was being exposed to people and women and things that I had never, ever--God, my God, I mean you get in the Playboy Club back in those days.  Remember, when I grew up in the era of, I mean I came into show business in the era of the drug revolution, right after civil rights, the sexual revolution.  All this was going on when I'm running around the Playboy Clubs and [Playboy] Bunnies and entertainers and free love.  It was just, it was--for a little ole country boy with roots in Whaleyville, Virginia, it was--I can't say it was more than I could handle, and I'm not using it as an excuse.  But I liked it.  It was, it was incredible for me, and I thought, okay, I'm not gonna be right by this.  I didn't want to become, and I don't blame my father [William Reid], but I didn't want to become my father.  I didn't wanna have that life of children out there.  Thank God, to this day, I don't know that I have any, but so far, I'm sure that with Facebook and everything else now, somebody would have said, "This is your son," (laughter), and I would have honored it.  But I didn't want that.  I didn't want to have bastard children running around.  I didn't want to have a string of women who I couldn't be with and a woman that I was doing this on.  I just didn't wanna do it.  But I knew that I had to, I felt that I was, I was, that I had to go in that direction in terms of, of living that part of my life.  And I did, and it was incredible.  It was dangerous, it was exciting.  It'll be in my memoirs, but I couldn't do it to her.  So I thought it was best that we, we separate because I knew where I was going, and I went there.
Story_ID: 291430
Speaker 1: Now tell us about 'Easy Does It' ['Easy Does It...Starring Frankie Avalon'].  Is this your first movie role?
Speaker 2: No, 'Easy Does It' was a television show.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Easy Does It' was my first series.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And 'Easy Does It' was (laughter), I gotta tell you, again, how my life has put me in these things is always a bit strange.  It's never been a straight arrow.  It's always been irony.  Seventy-five [1975], things were difficult.  I had--Della [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett] and I had split up.  I moved alone 'cause I knew I had to get my life in order and do it my way.  I'd just come back from South Africa, life was--and wasn't working.  Nothing was going on.  And so I started doing standup, spending nights at The Comedy Store [Los Angeles, California] trying to get an act together, trying to make it work 'cause I need an act.  I need to, need to get this thing going.  I gotta get my head back into show business.  Tom [Dreesen]'s taken off, and I'm working dives (laughter).  So I recorded an album ['Breaking Face'], comedy album down in San Diego [California], and that didn't quite take off.  It was gonna be as Casablanca Records, and that fell apart.  So I get this call to go to a place in Washington, D.C. called the Board Room [ph.].  And I'm going, what is the Board Room?  Well, that's a little place off on 14th Street, and it's owned by this guy who we think is, you know, in the mafia, but we don't know.  It's a nice little--I said, all right.  I need the money.  How much money are they gonna pay me?  They were gonna pay me $700 a week.  My God, and they were gonna put in my own apartment in Washington?  How many weeks?  Eight weeks.  Well, I ain't worked in a year.  I'm there.  So I get on a plane.  I fly to Washington, and I get to this--and they put me in a wonderful studio apartment, right on M [Street] and Massachusetts [Avenue], somewhere like that.  I don't know where it is, but, and I go to the Board Room.  It's a topless place (laughter).  It's a topless bar on 14th Street run by a guy who allegedly was in organized crime.  And his name is Lenny [ph.], nice man (laughter).  And matter of fact, while I was there, he was being investigated by the [U.S.] Senate subcommittee for organized crime.  But anyway (laughter), I go work this club.  Again, allegedly, not proven.  I go work this club, and there are, the women are topless.  They stand on tables and they dance and flash their breasts.  And I'm going like, okay, how much they paying me?  I'm gonna be here for eight weeks.  It was the turning point in my career.  I worked there--they wanted me to do these god awful, nasty jokes.  I said, no, I'm gonna build an act.  So I started doing political humor.
Story_ID: 291431
Speaker 1: I started doing, you know, storytelling and stuff like that, and it began to work.  Took me a while, took me a while, but it began to work.  Well, then my--they [Board Room (ph.), Washington, D.C.] have a lunch crowd.  People from the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] and government buildings would come at lunch, and then at night I'd do two shows, six nights a week.  So think about that, eight weeks, six nights a week, I'm up there, and my daytime crowd began to be--I used to, I forgot what was going on politically then, but a lot.  And I would talk about it and make jokes, and word would get back to Mark Russell [Mark Ruslander] over at the Washington [D.C.] hotel where he was performing.  And we would exchange, people would come and tell me what he said about the same thing, and they would tell.  So I became--I never spent any time with him, but once I met him.  But word would get back and forth from people talking about, well, "The guy over there said."  So I'm kind of building a little, a little audience here, and I'm also, at nighttime, I'm hanging out with the Washington underground crowd.  I'm going to speak easies.  I'm hanging out with these young ladies who are standing on tables.  Well, it was an interesting group.  One of 'em, the guy who was a bus boy, his father worked for the Shah [Mohammad Reza Pahlavi].  He was a medical student, and I would hear things that were going on in this place called Iran.  The Shah was still in power (laughter).  And one of the girls was getting, she spoke Russian, and she was getting her law degree at Georgetown [University Law Center, Washington, D.C.].  Another one was some little country yokel who had just come up here from the South, running away from abuse in the family.  And so I got these interesting people, these women who all take me under their wing (laughter) or wings I should say and they protect me.  And they take me out.  So I've got this nightlife.  I've got this apartment, and I'm writing this comedy.  And so when I finish, I go back to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], I got plenty, I got enough money to last me for a year 'cause I'm banking my money.  I'm sending some home to my kids [Tori Reid and Timothy Reid II] and I'm banking my money.
Story_ID: 291432
Speaker 1: So I go back [to Hollywood, Los Angeles, California].  I'm a little cocky.  I got a little money.  I'm like hey, I can hang.  I get back.  I get this call--I'm back one day, I get a call saying they're auditioning for a show called 'Easy Does It' ['Easy Does It...Starring Frankie Avalon'], and they want comics.  They're looking for a black comic to go with this group they've already put together.  So I go over and Moffitt, John Moffitt and a bunch of people in the room.  And they said, "All right, we want you to do some sketches here," he says, "but before we get going here, what you been up to?"  I said, "Well, what I've been up to."  And I start telling stories about what was happening, me at the club [Board Room (ph.), Washington, D.C.] and some of the hysterical stuff that was going on.  And they were, I had 'em laughing.  They were just laughing.  I'm telling 'em about this guy, the balloon man, and all that.  So when I finished, I said, oh, (unclear) enough.  And he says, oh, gosh, we didn't get, and they said, "Forget the audition.  You got the job."  So I become part of a group called The War Babies and I start doing sketch comedy, and I'm working with Phyllis Diller, Bob Hope and I'm on this show with Annette Funicello and, and boy, his name just jumped out of my head.  Oh, gosh--
Speaker 2: Frankie Avalon.
Speaker 1: Frankie Avalon, thank you, Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello called 'Easy Does It,' and it's a sketch comedy show.  And we'd do what I think is some brilliant--this is a precursor to 'Saturday Night Live' ['SNL'], we do some brilliant sketches.  And one sketch we did, they asked me--[President Richard Milhous] Nixon and Sammy Davis [Jr.] had just done that infamous hug.  And so they wanted to do a take on that.  So I dressed as Sammy.  I had all these chains and stuff and, and I do this sketch--even Sammy saw it.  It was funny, very funny.  Well, some people at MTM [Enterprises] saw it.  And the next day, I get this call.  They said, "Would you come over to MTM?" That's back when the factories were in, in vogue.  They said, "We saw this piece.  Would you mind auditioning for this show called 'Rhoda'?"  I auditioned.  I get it.  And I become part of the MTM group that they look to.  And from that, I got 'WKRP in Cincinnati' and on and on and on.  I mean it was just, again, happenstance.  But had I not come back, had not gone to Washington [D.C.] and loosened up and got away from Hollywood and got into myself, I wouldn't have been as free to do that.
Story_ID: 291433
Speaker 1: An addendum to that story is, I get a call before I get '[W]KRP [in Cincinnati'], a year or two before I get 'KRP,' I get a call from this guy, "Hey, I want you come back to the club [Board Room (ph.), Washington, D.C.]."  I said, "Nah, man, Lenny [ph.], I'm doing, I'm trying to"--"Come on back, man, I need ya."  I said, "All right."  And I work, I work six weeks.  They pay me a little bit more money.  You gotta give me a raise, give me a raise.  And I have a good time.  Now, a year later, it's two years later, I'm at 'KRP.'  Life's good.  I got a series.  I get the call, "Hey, I need ya back at the club.  Things aren't going well.  We need a headliner.  I want you to come."  I'm going, "Hey, Lenny, I got 'KRP,'" (laughter).  "I'm a TV personality.  I can't come to work a topless place."  "Hey, this is me," (laughter). "You owe me, and you know," I says, you know, 'cause again my background, (unclear) fair is fair.  You do what you do.  I said, "You're right, Lenny.  I do owe you.  I'll be there."  I said, "But I ain't working the eight.  I ain't working--how much you can give me?  I said, "I'll give you four weeks, and you're gonna pay me some money."  "How much?"  So I told him.  "Oh, nah, nah."  I said, "All right."  We settled.  I went back.  I did my four weeks, and I'm proud that I was there.  He didn't even let me perform.  Most of the time, I sat at the table and talked with him.  And every now and then his son, the club is gone.  I think Lenny has passed, but I'll see his son somewhere in [Las] Vegas [Nevada].  He'll walk up and say, "I'm Lenny's son."  And I'll give him a big hug.  They, you know, the experience changed my life.
Speaker 2: I guess, but when you went back, I guess you were like a big, really a big deal because you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was a big deal--
Speaker 2: --were on TV.
Speaker 1: --at that, yeah, I was on TV, and, you know, we got, but he wouldn't let me perform (laughter).  I would only do the lunch thing.  He only wanted me for the lunch thing.  At night, people would come in to see me, and he'd go, "Ah, he's not, get away, he's not performing.  I'm talking to him," (laughter).
Story_ID: 291434
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about 'The Richard Pryor Show.'  Now, this is before ['W]KRP [in Cincinnati'], right, 'Richard Pryor' (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, 'Richard Pryor' was before 'KRP.'
Speaker 1: Now, this is a legendary show.  I've got it at home on DVD myself.  So what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Richard [Pryor] was, 'The Richard Pryor Show' was a dream come true for so many of us.  It was, it was what Robin Williams, myself, and on and on and on, John Witherspoon, Paul Mooney, what we'd all dreamed of.  And Paul Mooney is the reason that, that we were all there.  Paul, who was a writer and friend of Richard, was given the task--Richard knew his, his abilities better than, of course, anyone.  And he knew that in order for him to have the freedom to create, he needed to be in a familiar, he needed to be around people who could play with him.  Richard loved to play, play with ya, and he was always challenging you.  But he didn't want to get a bunch of actors.  He wanted young people who understood timing, who--so he wanted to improv [improvise].  So he told Paul, you go get me a bunch of guys that I can play off of, guys and women.  So Paul, in working with all of us at The Comedy Store [Los Angeles, California] and improv, he came and said, "All right, guys.  I'm putting some of you guys together."  But he chose us.  He said, "I want this one"--he knew, he knew us.  So he picked me, he picked Mooney--of course, everybody wanted Robin Williams.  He picked Robin Williams.  So he put us all together.  And we were this troupe.  And I would say that I have yet to have any opportunity in show business with as much freedom to create as we had on 'The Richard Pryor Show.'  If--they weren't written--I mean they'd have (unclear).  They'd have a--they didn't even have an outline.  Sometimes we'd go on and we never knew any day what it was gonna be.  Sometimes we walk in, and he would say, "We're going to have a meeting with Richard beforehand."  It was so much going on in Richard's life at that time, I mean, you know, they shot the car, the (unclear), oh, it was just stuff was going on.  So we all go to Richard's dressing room, and you get there, and he said, "All right."  He said, "Today we're gonna do a scene in the insane asylum.  Everybody go to the wardrobe, pick your wardrobe."  And we'd go pick our wardrobe.  I'd get a (unclear), and he said, "Okay, here's the setting.  I'm a doctor.  I'm coming in," and dah, dah, dah, "Go."  And we would just roll, and he'd walk through and we'd play off of him.  He'd play off of us.

Speaker 1: And those incredible skits would come about [on 'The Richard Pryor Show'].  I remember one day when he [Richard Pryor]--and you never know which skits you would do.  He'd pick you based on your performance.  I mean you had to bring it or you weren't gonna be in many skits.  So he picked, he said, "All right, we're gonna do a takeoff on the '2001[: A Space Odyssey']," you know, the opening of '2001.'  He said, "All right, [HistoryMaker] Tim [Reid], [Paul] Mooney, Spoon [John Witherspoon]," and I forgot the, "[Jimmy] Martinez and me."  He said, "Take 'em over to Western Costume [Company, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California] and tell 'em to pick out a caveman outfit."  So we all get in the van by ourselves.  We'd go to Western Costume.  So I'm walking around Western Costume, and now, I got little skinny legs.  So I'm thinking I gotta hide my legs.  I'm get me some leg, something, I'm--so I go and I said--everybody's picking their outfits.  I find this loin cloth, and I said this is the one I want.  I open it up, and in it, it said, Tony Curtis, 'Spartacus,' (laughter).  So I wrapped it.  It's mine (laughter).  I wrapped Tony Curtis' 'Spartacus' thing around me.  We went and got some wigs and some clubs and went back.  And we did this scene from '2001,' completely adlibbed.  It was glorious, but we knew it was, it was too, too much ahead.  I mean it was--they would send spies, the network would send spies.  They would get guys and dress 'em in like windbreakers and stuff and sit 'em in the audience to watch. Nobody knew what we were doing, what we were trying to do.  They didn't understand it.  They certainly let Lorne Michaels do whatever he wanted to do on 'Saturday Night Live' ['SNL'] but for Richard, they just couldn't let him alone.  They couldn't, and he just said, you know--and the more they tried to control him, the more outrageous he became in terms of his, his stuff.  And the editor should get an award because the stuff that we did, the sketches sometimes went in ways that--I remember one sketch (laughter) we did, they only have a small portion of it.  It was a sketch, he says, "All right, everybody's gonna be in preschool."  So we all got preschool outfits on, little kids, and they built this incredible set with life-size toys, teddy bears and dolls, all life-size and huge cribs (laughter).  And he said, "All right, roll cameras, let 'em in.  Ya'll come in one by one and then come in twos," and so, you know, imagine Robin Williams, Richard Pryor and me, we get in this place.  And it becomes unbelievably weird.  I mean it ended with somebody humping the teddy bear (laughter), and it turned into, I mean one of the most graphically strange comedy bits I've ever seen.  Of course, it couldn't go on the air, only a small portion of it.  But sessions and the things we did.  He did some--I think Richard did probably to this day one of the most powerful anti-drug pieces in the history of television, including stuff that you see on 'Saturday Night Live.'  And it was called, something dead.  He played a rock star whose name was death--Black Death.  If you go back and look at Black Death, and you gotta remember, Richard was doing drugs pretty heavily then, it's probably one of the most powerful anti-drug pieces that you'll ever see.  When you look at the theme and you look at the propaganda that's being produced during that piece of Black Death.  It's a very powerful piece.  He did some, Richard did a thing, one of my favorite pieces he did was inherit, he did the Scopes "Monkey" Trial [State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes, 1925], 'Inherit the Wind' (laughter).  I played the blind man in it where I came in and sat in the white section, and went (sniffing) and touched the white man's hair and go, "Whew, I know I'm in the wrong place" (laughter).  I mean we just--brilliant stuff, brilliant stuff.
Story_ID: 291436
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know I remember the one [skit on 'The Richard Pryor Show'] with [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was in the first one, yeah, yeah.  We did the first black president.  You know, I was in that.  That's running around on YouTube now occasionally, but, yeah, it was, it was an experience for us creatively.  We didn't money.  I think we got like $200 an episode, 250 [dollars], something like that.  Who cared? I'd a paid him a thousand dollars to be on it.  But the experience to be with Richard [Pryor], and then Sundays, Richard would have these little salons at his house.  And we'd go and hang out with Richard on Sundays and Sammy Davis [Jr.] would come by or whoever would come by, [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones and Stevie Wonder.  And we'd all just sit around and drink and talk and laugh and play cards.  And it was a glorious thing for a young guy who's trying to make it in business, in show business, to be around the kind of, those kind of people and that kind of time in show business.  You learned from it, and I learned a great deal about the business of show business, the down time.
Speaker 1: Now the show lasted, what, four episodes?
Speaker 2: Five really.  The first one and four that we were involved with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they just couldn't deal with it.  They canceled it.  They just could not handle what we were doing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's considered a treasure now to own a copy of the DVDs.
Speaker 2: Ah, it is brilliant.  It's, it's Richard Pryor's first and only real attempt at television.
Speaker 1: Now, did you develop a close relationship with Richard at all?
Speaker 2: Richard and I were always--we had a very, what's the word, soulful relationship.  I met Richard early on before I moved to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] 'cause he had come through Chicago [Illinois].  And Richard and I are para--our lives had some very eerie parallels, raised by grandmothers, lived in a whorehouse and sort of kind of, we're--I was, I was not a real tough kid, but I hung around with real tough people, killers.  And yet I was able to survive, and they used to--I have a certain amount of respect.  Of the group that I grew up in and Richard and I were talking about this, they used to call me "college boy" because I was the only one of them that went to college.  And when I would come back and stay with my [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid], I had to hang with those guys.  I had to go see them.  They would see me in the area and they would always say, "Hey," you know, "Here come college boy."  And they would have to, you know, they'd punch and I'd punch and we'd fake the little stuff.  But they always kind of let me go.  They gave me a pass, and I think, and to some extent, they respected.  One of the kids who became the toughest and the head of the gang--it was a gang called the Corner Boys, I was a junior corner boy, but I didn't make the full fledge 'cause what you had to do to become a full fledge corner boy, I didn't have the, I didn't have the spirit for it.  To be honest with you, I didn't have the guts to do that.  But he became the head guy.  Well, he and I were, were childhood friends.  He was a smart guy.  He used to do my homework for me.  This kid was brilliant, I think it was Raymond.  Raymond was like, he was a born leader.  Raymond was a born leader.  He became the head of this very powerful street gang and very smart man, and he protected me.

Speaker 1: Okay, 'WKRP in Cincinnati.'  Now, we were interested in that in Dayton [Ohio] because we were fifty miles from it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: I think Gordon Jump was in it.
Speaker 2: Gordon Jump from Dayton, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so what, you played Gordon "Venus Flytrap" Sims.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Gordon Sims, Venus Flytrap.  Yeah, that was, you know, it's a funny thing about, about show business sometimes.  You, you--I had just been fired from a show called 'Looking Good' [ph.].  It was starring a new sensation, a young lady named Sheryl Lee Ralph.  She was nineteen years old, and she had--Hollywood was stunned by her.  She had appeared on Broadway in something and had come to California, and they wanted to do a sitcom around her.  And they brought me in to play a guy who owned a beauty shop.  And it was gonna be about a beauty shop, and I was the owner.  It was poorly written.  But anyway, my character was supposed to be a guy who lived in two worlds.  He lived with--the barbershop was on the corner of, well, in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], one of the funniest things that is real is that Rodeo Drive, it's call Rodeo Drive until you get to the black neighborhood.  Then it's called Rodeo Drive (laughter).  They don't change the street signs, but everybody knows, you cross that block, it's Rodeo.  This side is Rodeo (laughter).  So the beauty shop was supposed to be located, one side Rodeo, right where that is.  So my clients were, some were from Rodeo Drive and the majority of them were from Rodeo Drive.  So my character had this sort of split personality.  When I had a Rodeo Drive client, it was like "Hello, it's so good to see you, Cecily."  And then when, "Yo, mama, come sit down."  It was that kind of thing.  Well, when the script was first given to me, it was 50-50, "Hello, it's so good to see you, Cecily, oh, yes," and "Yo mama."  And as this director started directing the first day, the first day, he took 15 percent of "Hello, it's so good to see you, Cecily," and it was more "Yo mama," the first day.  Second day, it's 75 percent "Yo mama," and I'm going like, hey, man, what I liked about the part was this guy who was effeminate, but not gay.  You don't know what he is, but he's, and you're killing this part.  He said, "Oh, look, man, you don't understand."  Well, near the third--Wednesday, it was 98 percent "Yo mama," and I'm holding onto "Hello, Cecily," (laughter), you know.  And so he and I are not getting along.  And he looked at me, and he said, "You know, I never thought you were black enough for this part, and let me show you how this should be played"--
Speaker 1: This is a--
Speaker 2: A white guy.  And he struts and struts and he and I just--I go to my Norfolk, Virginia side of me and my, my bipolar side and he and I get into it.  And I tell him, first of all, I say, "You know what?  You're right, you're blacker than I am.  You should play the part.  Why don't you go cork up," (laughter).  Well, that didn't go over too well.  So he runs to the producer and tells her, "Get rid of him."  She doesn't know what to do.  That night before Thursday, I get a call from her.  Her name is Bonnie Dorr [ph.], a friend of mine to this day.  She says, "[HistoryMaker] Tim [Reid], I don't know how," she said.  I said, "You're firing me."  She says, "Yes."  I said, "Thank God," (laughter).
Story_ID: 291438
Speaker 1: You had some trepidation about playing the part of Venus Flytrap [Gordon Sims on 'WKRP in Cincinnati'], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You didn't want him to be too over the top?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, see I'd just gotten fired [from 'Looking Good' (ph.)] for not being black enough.  So I get this call--this happened on a Wednesday night.  Friday, I get this call late in the day.  They had been looking at a lot of people, and they hadn't made up their mind, could I come in Monday morning to read for a show called 'WKRP in Cincinnati.'  I said, "Okay, what's it about?"  "You'll get the sides when you get there."  So I get there.  I go in the audience and there's every black man from young to old is sitting in the room, Philip Michael Thomas, you name it, Glynn Turman, everybody, Richard Roundtree, everybody's in the room.  And I went, oh, God, here we go.  So I pick up the sides, and I look at it, and it says, "Venus Flytrap enters the room.  He's got on an ermine coat and a big hat."  And I just suddenly go, here we go again.  And I'm getting angry.  I don't even bother to read all the way through it.  I read the first part.  I don't read the whole script.  I just read his entrance.  I said, ah.  So I sit there and I'm thinking about I just got fired from not being black enough.  I ain't black enough for this.  I don't play black.  I just, I'm just--I am what I am.  And I'm sitting there, how do I go.  So I get my call to go in.  And in there is Hugh Wilson who's the creator of the show, David Sandberg who's, Jay Sandberg [sic. Jay Sandrich] who's one of the major directors.  He directed all the hit comedies back in the day, the casting director and Grant Tinker who was the head of MTM [Enterprises] sitting in the room.  I go and sit down, and I'm uncomfortable.  And Hugh had the, had the--the first thing he said, "So, have you read the script?"  I said, "Yeah, some of it."  He said, "What do you think?"  And there was that pause just like that, and I said, ah, what the hell?  I said, "You really wanna know what I think?"  He said, "Yeah."  I said, "Well, first of all I don't know if I wanna be sixty-something years old and have somebody say, 'Hey, Venus Flytrap,'" and everybody laughed.  I said, "Secondly, you know, I come from a black community that had disc jockeys."  I said, "And in my experience, [Daddy] Jack Holmes," and I started naming 'em, I said, "There's a different side.  There is the radio air personality, and then there's this person behind the scene.  I don't see but a one-dimensional character.  I don't know if I wanna, wanna play a guy who's just Venus Flytrap."  And so (laughter) Jay or somebody said, "All right, thank you" (laughter). Grant said, "Thank you."  It was like, no need for you to read.  Hugh said, "Wait a minute."  He said, "What do you mean?"  And I went a little further.  He says, "You know what?  You're right.  I'm from the South.  I lived in Atlanta, Georgia.  You're right, they do have a different"--he says, "I like--you're the first person to come in here and say that."  And he said, "And I'm glad you said it because I've been thinking about that, and I'm, I'm, I really would like to see you read because I'd like to know."  And so I read.  I got up to leave.  I later found out that all of them said, "No," but Hugh.  Hugh said, "Yeah, you're right, but he didn't read any worse or any better than anybody else."  He said, "But, you know, his instincts are right.  Can I have him?"  And they were going like, "Well, he's not, he's not really an important character in the script.  If you really want him," he said, "Yeah, I really want him."  Said, "All right, you can have him, but we're gonna have something to do."  So, he lost--he won the battle with me, but he lost the battle with Andy Travis [sic. Gary Sandy] who played Gary [sic. Andy Travis]--he wanted, I forgot who he wanted.  But they wouldn't give him.  And they picked the gentleman, Gary Sandy.  So he lost the battle with me--I mean won the battle with me, but he lost.  So that's how I got the show.
Story_ID: 291439
Speaker 1: The first season [of 'WKRP in Cincinnati'], you may not realize, I was not in all the episodes.  And they, what they would do is that each character in the first season was supposed to get a show about them.  Everybody had one.  With the last show of the season, I said, "Hugh [Wilson], everybody had, I can't"--matter of fact, they even sent guys to give me black lessons.  They sent a guy there.  I don't--young white kid, to tell me that I wasn't black enough.  They said, "Look," and they (laughter), this is what they said to me, I will never forget it, guys from New York, you know, the guys who go to the Laker [Los Angeles Lakers] games, white kids that would really know.  They know, they knew Magic [Johnson] personally.  So they come in (laughter) and they're giving me these black lesson, not so much working it, but telling me, "You know, you gotta loosen up, brother."  You know, you know, and they're telling me, "Brother this," and "brother that," and I'm sitting looking at him, right.  And he said, "For instance," he said, "now, you've seen 'Good Times,'" and I said, "Yeah, I've seen 'Good Times.'"  I liked the show as a matter of fact.  The guy [Eric Monte] who wrote it, who wrote 'Cooley High.'  I said, "Yeah, I like it.  It's based on 'Cooley High.'"  He said, "Well, J.J. [Jimmie Walker]," I said, "Well, you know, I'm not against J.J. doing the part.  I'd a done it a little differently, but that's his choice."  He said, "That's what we want.  You can be a break-away character.  You can have a doll after you.  You got to go there."  In other words, he wants me to buffoon it up, Venus Flytrap [Gordon Sims], "Yo Mama."  I said, "Well, man, I don't know."  So I go back and I tell, and Hugh said, "Ah, the hell with those guys, to hell with those guys.  I ain't got time for that.  Your character is perfect.  Don't worry about it, don't worry about it."  So I said, "But Hugh, I don't have a show.  That means I won't be back next year.  I know that."  He said, "Well, look.  I wrote one for you.  They don't want you to do it"--I mean, "They don't want me to do it."  I said, "What?"  He says, "Well, it's about who's Gordon Sims."  I said, "What do you mean?"  He said, "Well, that's your real name.  Your name, real name is gonna be Gordon Sims."  I said, "What is it about?"  He said, "It's about [the] Vietnam [War]."  I said, "Vietnam?"  No one had ever done a show on Vietnam on television.  He said, I said, "Vietnam?"  He said, "Yeah, Vietnam.  You will be a deserter."  I said, "A deserter from Vietnam?"  He said, "They don't want me to do the script."  I said, "What are you gonna do?"  He said, "Don't worry.  We're gonna get this script made 'cause this is one of my favorite ones I've written this year."  I said, "All right."  We go, we tape that episode ["Who Is Gordon Sims?"].  Next week, he called and he says, "We're gonna do it."  I said, "What happened?"  He says, "They don't think the show is coming back.  They don't want to spend any more money, and it's gonna cost them for me to write another script."  So they said, "Go ahead and shoot the one you got," 'cause they didn't think the show was coming back.  They were gonna cancel the show.  So we get ready to shoot the show.  But they said, "You must bring on a [U.S.] military observer."  They brought in two people from the [U.S.] Marine Corps, one from Marine Corps and one from the [U.S.] Army, who sat in the stands on rehearsal to make sure.  Well, when, after a couple of days' rehearsals, those guys said, "This must be made."  We want this show done.  This is the first show that's ever really gone into the Vietnam experience in a way that makes us feel comfortable.  We taped the show.  Mary Tyler Moore came, Grant Tinker came, and it was, it was quite a night.  It was quite a night.  Mary Tyler Moore came to me after the show crying.  She says, "I don't know when I've cried emotionally at a sitcom."  She said, "Young man, you've done a great job."  The reviews were unbelievable, "That [HistoryMaker] Tim Reid, true to force."  And low and below in the reruns in the summer, the show goes to number one and we get picked up a second season.  And then my character becomes more part of the flow of the show.  But that's how Venus Flytrap became Gordon Sims and how I survived that first season.  I was the lowest played member of the cast, by the way.
Speaker 2: Did that continue?
Speaker 1: No, no, we changed that--worked together and changed it.  We came together as a unit and worked it.  We split it up into two halves, the top half and the second half.  But at that time, I was the lowest played member of the cast.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 291440
Speaker 1: Now what did that show ['WKRP in Cincinnati'] reveal about the character of Venus Flytrap and Gordon Sims?
Speaker 2: Well, what was wonderful is that, again, it got back to my original comment about it being a duality of person.  Venus Flytrap was his show time persona.  But behind him was a school teacher who had retired from school teaching, had been run out of school teaching.  He didn't like the way it was going and had to survive, and was an intelligent man and went into this thing.  And he had been, he was hiding a secret and the secret was he was a Vietnam [War] vet, had seen something like most Vietnam vets had seen.  And now we're getting the same thing with the Iraqi [Iraq War] veterans.  You see things, as a young man, nineteen, twenty years old, you know, in combat, seeing things that disturbed them psychologically, emotionally.  And they come back, and they're supposed to come back into this world and just kind of be normal and not hurt anybody and, you know, just go with the bullshit.  And he couldn't do it.  So he deserted.  He didn't actually desert during battle. He had done battle.  But on the way back to go from his, to go from Vietnam back to his base to be discharged honorably, at the airport, he just said, "Hell with it" and walked away.  And they had been looking for him.  But he didn't really desert the battle.  He deserted the--all he had was just to go to the base and be discharged.  And he just walked away from it.  He just wanted to get away.  He had just seen something on a helicopter where they had thrown these Viet Cong prisoners out of the helicopter and it just disturbed him.  And from that moment, when he saw that, he was released like a few days later, he just got off that plane and says, "I'm through."  And they traced him down and arrested him, and he got a--they let him off, Gordon Jump.  It was a wonderful show, powerful, and it was the first show--as a matter of fact, it gave me my first acting award (laughter).  You would think my first acting award would have been at the Emmys [Emmy Awards] or the black--or whatever it was.  My first acting award I got for Gordon Sims, "Who Is Gordon Sims?" was given to me by the [U.S.] Marine Corps down in [Marine Corps Base] Camp Pendleton [San Diego County, California] during the halftime of the Leatherneck football game (laughter).  I walked out on a soggy field in front of Marines to be given an acting award.  And they gave me a plaque that I still have for my acting in "Who Is Gordon Sims?"
Story_ID: 291441
Speaker 1: 'WKRP [in Cincinnati'] runs from--
Speaker 2: Four years.
Speaker 1: --for four years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, seventy--well, we started late '77 [1977], but it went to '81 [1981] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eighty-two [1982]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: Eight-one [1981], okay, all right.  Now, so what happened next after '81 [1981]?
Speaker 2: Well, after 'KRP in Cincinnati' we were all sort of shocked that it was cancelled.  That show should have gone on ten years.  And matter of fact, we were number one the summer after we were cancelled (laughter).  So--but it was not cancelled because of the show.  It was cancelled because of hatred.  The then head of CBS hated Hugh Wilson.  It was just--we were outcast.  I've always been sort of this outcast and never brought into the quote "Hollywood" community.  Until this day, I mean I'm not part of black Hollywood.  I'm not part of white Hollywood.  My career and who I am as a performer has always been sort of ignored by both sides.  So I'm an outcast.  I've always been.  I set myself up to be one.  This is not a complaint.  This is with pride (laughter) 'cause I've always been that way.  Hugh Wilson is the same way.  He was an outcast.  He's a rebel.  And so he got into a lot of conflict with the network, always.  So when the show was cancelled because they could not handle him or control him, we were all thrown out.  And because we were part of this sort of rebel show, only one or two of us, Loni [Anderson] and Howard [Hesseman] really began to work.  And I was like, oh, what am I gonna do.  I'm not, I need to work.  And I had met my wife, [HistoryMaker] Daphne [Maxwell Reid], my second wife, I had met her, and she had been on the show.  I'd written a couple episodes for her.  Hugh had allowed me to write, learn producing.  I mean, under his under his mentorship, I became a writer and a producer and became a member of the Writers Guild [of America], wrote episodes, produced episodes.  I learned a lot about that part of the business from his freedom that he allowed us.  So I was like, what am I gonna do?  I'm, I want to get married, but I can't afford it.  So I get a call from some guys from Chicago [Illinois] who had seen some things that I had done.  I was writing poetry and shooting some, what we call now, music videos.  They weren't music videos and there was no MTV [Music Television].  And some people that some of them had got them to Bob Guccione.  So I get this call from (laughter) Bob Guccione --
Speaker 1: Of Penthouse.
Speaker 2: Of Penthouse, saying, "I've seen some of your stuff.  They're very sensual without being erotic.  Would you like to do a television magazine show for me?"  So I fly to New York [New York].  I go and meet Bob Guccione, and we talk, and he gives me a quarter of a million dollars and his empire, and he says, "Take my magazine and make it worthy--make it ability to put on television."
Story_ID: 291442
Speaker 1: So I take off.  I go to Spain.  I go, I'm shooting at the Penthouse magazine.  I got all these nude women and I'm shooting this and writing this thing.  So I'm working for Bob Guccione.  He was the first person to hire me as a producer.  And meanwhile, he gets into some legal stuff with La Costa [Carlsbad, California] and some very powerful people.  And they confiscate all the stuff that we shot and big lawsuit.  And to this day, only one thing that I shot has ever been seen.  But we shot all over.  We shot twenty-five hours of stuff that I wrote, fantasy things, and all that.  So when that was over, a matter of fact, I discovered the young lady who was gone on to become Emanuel III or IV [ph.], I think she was.  But it was a real interesting experience, traveling the world and shooting these beautiful women and writing the stuff.  And [HistoryMaker] Daphne [Maxwell Reid] was with me in some of it, and I said to myself, what am I doing?  This is not, I can't do this.  Let me go back to television.  So she and I got into an argument, and I said, that's it.  I'm leaving.  So I went to Spain, just took off and went.  So I've always been traveling.  I love traveling.  So I went to Spain.  I said, "When I get back, you can't be here, we're--this is over."  So I go to Spain, and I'm over there for a while, and I realize that, do I really wanna go back into the gene pool?  I mean I got a wonderful woman, and yadda, yadda, yadda.  I had kind of a strange experience in Marbella, Spain.  And I said, you know, I'm a fool.  I think I'm a fool.  I don't know what I'm gonna do, but I've made a wrong choice.  But there's nothing I can do about it now.  That's all I said, nothing I can do about it.  So I fly out of Madrid [Spain], come back to New York [New York]--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  I have to ask you.  What is the strange experience that you had?  I just--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) A sad experience to say the least.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had an experience with a young lady in Spain that awakened me to the--some of the dilemma that people have in relationships.  It reminded me a little bit of my mother [Augustine Wilkins] and what she had gone through with men.  And here I am, I didn't want to be on--I didn't want to be one of the people who did to women what was done to my mother.  And I could see that in a--this woman who had been emotionally abused, not mentally, but left with a child by someone who was an Olympic athlete who had come through Germany and seen her.  And she was a beautiful woman and fooled her and made her believe this was the future and left her.  And she had just gone on to become a business woman.  She was actually a business woman in Marbella owned a club.  And I spent some time with her, and the sadness that she had, and I saw her child, and I was like, this ain't the life.  This is not what I want.  This is, this is, a wonderful lady and, but it's too much baggage that I want to--and I'm bringing mine.  She's got hers.  And I said, you know, I had a pretty nice thing.  What was, what was in that relationship that I'm not gonna have in this one?  What is, what was the thing?  Is it me?  Is it that person?  It was really me and my ego.  So that's what I was thinking.  So I get back on the plane to fly out of Madrid, and the plane almost crashes.  It's the most, I haven't had a take-off like that since, thank God.  But it was a horrible take off.  We scraped trees.  It was a miracle, oh, it was just unbelievable, people screaming, things falling out of the side.  So I had this near-death experience (laughter).

Speaker 1: I land in JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York], and those are the days that you didn't have to go through all the security and customs.  You could just come out and see people.  And as I come out, I look up, and there's [HistoryMaker] Daphne [Maxwell Reid].  She had flown all the way from California to meet me in New York [New York].  And I look at her, and I'm going, "What are you"--so as we were going through customs, I look at her, and I said, "Will you marry me?"  And I hadn't even cleared.  She says, "Well, yeah."  I said, "Well, let me clear customs."  So I go through customs.  I see her, and I says, she says, "Why do you?"  I said, "I had an epiphany over there [Spain].  And why--let's make this work."  I said, but, I said, "Okay, but I have three conditions."  She said, "What?"  I said, "The kids have to approve," which I figured they wouldn't, to be honest with you.  "Secondly, I gotta have a series."  I didn't say job.  I said, "I gotta have a series," and I forgot what the third one was, oh, "and we have to go on a honeymoon, 'cause I've never been on one and you've never been on one, a real honeymoon."  She says, "Okay, I agree to all three."  I said, "All right."  So we get in the car to go back to the hotel.  I get in the hotel.  I go to the desk, and he says, "Are you [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Tim] Reid?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "There's a message for you."  I said, "A message?"  How did they--"Yes."  So I look up and it's my manager, Jan McCormack [ph.].  So I call her.  I said, "Jan, what's up?"  She said, "You just got back in the country.  I knew you were coming.  Thank God that Daphne knew where you were staying."  I said, "What is it?"  She said, "Come back to Hollywood.  You have a series."  I said, "Excuse me?"  I said, "I'm not flying out there for no audition."  She said, "No, no, no, not auditioning.  It's a series.  You start work next Monday."  I said, "Oh," and I look at Daphne.  She obviously heard her on the phone.  She says, "Okay, I'll start making wedding plans," (laughter).  And so I had to get married.  So I come back.  I do a series called 'Teachers Only' with Norman Fell, Lynn Redgrave, Jean Smart.  Oh, it was a--Joel Brooks, Teresa Ganzel, and it was a thirteen episode at NBC, called 'Teachers Only.'
Speaker 2: Now, this is 1982?
Speaker 1: No, this is nineteen--the end of '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: Eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: Yeah, '81 [1981], '82 [1982], yeah, I think the fall of '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: And then you got married in '82 [1982]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got married--no, it was in '82 [1982].  You're right.  It's '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982], okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was '82 [1982].  Thank you, '82 [1982].  And so I get the series.  We get our first paycheck, and that December, we get married a few weeks later, and we take an incredible honeymoon in Jamaica, rented a villa and had a wonderful time.  Kids agreed, to my surprise.
Story_ID: 291444
Speaker 1: So why were you surprised by that?
Speaker 2: They hated each other.  I mean my--her [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid] son [Christopher Tubbs] hated me.  We didn't get along at all.  We didn't like each other.  Matter of fact, I remember when he was very depressed.  And her mother [Rosalee Harris Maxwell] wasn't too fond of me.  She thought I was too much like her father [Green Maxwell], too dictatorial, which I was.  But her son and I just didn't like each other.  I didn't like him, so, 'cause, you know, he was worried about his mom and everything.  And I just didn't have time for it.  And my son [Timothy Reid II] didn't particularly--my daughter [Tori Reid] didn't care for her either.  So the two of them, I figured would neutralize each other.  I remember when we decided to get married, I told her son, we came in, and I said, "Let me tell you something."  I said, "You and I don't like each other."  And he looked at me.  I said, "We know it's a fact.  Let's be honest."  He said, "All right."  I said, "But I'll tell you what.  You don't have to love me, and I'm not your father, will never be your father."  I said, "However, what I will do, and this is my word as a gentleman, I will respect you.  I respect who you are and what you mean to your mother and what you mean to yourself.  And all I ask is you respect me.  Can we shake on that?"  He said, "Yeah."  We shook hands and from that respect, we built a love between each other that is as strong as anything I have with my real son.  But it started with that, and I tell people who are having problems with stepchildren.  I said, the only problems people have with stepchildren, they always try to force a kid to, to feel what they want them to feel.  You can't force these young people to feel something they don't feel.  What you do is you build a base of respect.  Out of respect, politicians, anybody, if they use more respect, if people would respect the president, in a pattern of respect, there could get more done.  But if you don't respect a person, you're gonna do business, you're never gonna open up.  It's never gonna be a favorable relationship.  You gotta have respect.  Racially, that's, I think that's why I've been able to survive a little and have the kind of relationship I've had in show business, is that I've never feared white people.  And because I never feared them, I never had a hatred for 'em.  I've never had this deep down and going the white man, never, never feared.  So if you don't have the fear, then there is no real need for hatred, although some people can do it.  And so what I do is, I have a respect for people.  I respect them, no matter who they are or what they are, it always has to start with respect.  Now, if they disrespect me, I will most assuredly disrespect them, and to the degree that I can possibly do it.  So that's kind of the way I was taught in the streets of Norfolk [Virginia] and those whorehouses and speakeasies, and it was always respect.  You disrespect somebody down there, you (laughter) you've got hell to pay.  And you respect somebody down there, they'll save your life.  And I think that in life and in my show business career, it is the times that I have been successful, a lot of it comes out of respect, respect I have for the business, respect I have for my craft.  And the people that I don't do well, I mean, like I said, I've never been brought into black Hollywood.  I mean I never get invited, I've never been one of that group.
Story_ID: 291445
Speaker 1: I remember one time one of, one of the most--strangely enough, one of the most hurtful things that I've had about black Hollywood, had nothing to do with Hollywood.  It had to do with Ebony magazine which I adore, and I knew [HistoryMaker] Mr. [John H.] Johnson and Mrs. [Eunice] Johnson and [HistoryMaker] Linda [Johnson Rice].  I knew--I've always been involved with Jet.  One of the first jobs I had was selling the Jet.  So I had this, the first time I appeared in a national magazine was the Jet.  So Ebony picked one hundred, the one hundred best movies by Ebony's judge.  And I really was hurt that 'Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored' was not in that one hundred.  And I looked at some of the movies that were in there, and I thought, that's a direct slap at me.  The film was probably one of the most critically acclaimed films ever done by a black person in the history of the business.  You can't beat the reviews.  It did very well financially, and yet it was, it was not even given a nod.  And I thought, that's a, that's a slap at me.  That's disrespect.  And that's the only time that I've ever felt a sort of pissed off pain about Hollywood.  The rest of it, I could care less.
Speaker 2: Did you know how the movies were selected or what the process was?
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter.  I mean (laughter), if you look at the list.  And there were some that certainly--not that they don't deserve to be there, but if you can pick that, I know you know about that one, you know.  So it wasn't so much that it was, that it should--they have overlooked--they couldn't have overlooked it if they could have found that one, you know, or this one or that one.  That to me is the only time that I think I have felt slighted by--by black, the black (unclear). The rest of it, I don't, I've--when you, as I said before, when you say, and I think more young people need to understand this as I said earlier, when you say you're going to be independent, when you give the posture of being an independent person, there's a consequence and a responsibility to that.  And I am a rebel.  One of the reasons I wear this earring, a lot people say, why you--I've been wearing this earring since eighty, seventy, no, '77 [1977], '78 [1978].  I was the first black man allowed in primetime television to wear a earring.  It had to go all the way to the corporate board.  It was myself and Ed Bradley.  Ed Bradley was allowed to wear one.  I was allowed to wear one.  I'm also the first black man allowed to wear a beard in primetime television, Ed Bradley and myself.  We, we used to laugh and talk about that.  Why do I wear this?  People sometimes, when I do lectures, colleges, say, "Why you wear that earring?"  I said, because what it represents to me is that I'm a rebel.  It's like the pirate of the old days.  I'm a pirate in civilization, in society.  I'm a rebel.  I've always been.  I was trained to be a rebel.  I'm a survivor and a rebel.  So this is a reminder, not to anyone else, but to me that I must remain a rebel, that that's what I am, not bad, not negative, but I'm a rebel.  And a rebel has a responsibility to do that, to rebel, not necessarily aggressively or angrily but in their work, in their posture.  That's what I am.  I'm the grit in the oyster.  Now, that doesn't bring great success and it puts you on point a lot.  I've taken more arrows in the back than I have in the front because that's, that's the job of a rebel.  And if anything, I take it now as pride and that's why I continue to wear the earring.  Some time I find myself in Washington [D.C.] on the [Capitol] Hill, and sometimes they'll go, and they'll look at me.  I'm going, oh, yeah, that's right, I got the earring on.  What does that mean all dressed up, standing around all of these straight-laced politicians.  And I hope it means that, okay, he's a rebel.  And I wear that badge proudly.

Speaker 1: You mentioned black Hollywood, I mean how would you define black Hollywood?  And are the people that we think of as being in black Hollywood know they're in it, you know, I mean in the--
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, yes.  Yeah, people in black Hollywood know they're in black Hollywood.  They created it.  I mean what I'm saying is, black Hollywood is a needed, a purposeful entity.  And what it is, is there's always been a black Hollywood back in the day with Hattie McDaniels [Hattie McDaniel] and Lena Horne.  I mean there's always been, it's like in the days of entertainment, the chitterling circuit [Chitlin' Circuit].  Well, there had to be a chitterling circuit.  Well, black Hollywood is that, is that group of people who come together in order to stay together and survive the lack of opportunity within the bigger picture.  And some leave it and go into the bigger picture and never go back.  Ain't nothing wrong with that.  I mean I don't spite anybody who's successful in our business.  It's a very hard business, oh, God, it's a very difficult business.  It's easier to become a surgeon than to become a successful actor in Hollywood.  But in order to survive, they create these little enclaves because, within that, they network.  They help one another, hopefully, although it's a bit more back biting in black Hollywood than it is in (unclear).  I mean it's more crabs in the barrel than there should be, but it has to exist.  And, and you are smart to get in it, to be a part of it.  I've never been a joiner of anything, black or white Hollywood.  I've just never been.  It's just not my nature to want to be a part of the unit.  I'd rather be the scout.  I'm the guy who goes, let me go up ahead and look and see what's happening while you guys camp.  You know, that's just--that's in my nature.
Story_ID: 291447
Speaker 1: Your career kind of came on the tail end of the blaxploitation movie, or so-called blaxploitation movie era (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so called.  There's no such thing, but yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, and did you have any offers to be in any movies, you know, before they finally just kind of phased out?
Speaker 2: You know, I think I missed the black, the black film era of the '60s [1960s] because I was with a white guy [Tom Dreesen] doing comedy, interracial comedy, and that kind of sets me apart from black comedy and white comedy.  What are these guys doing?  What the hell are they up to?  So when the black exploitation part came or black film era came, those militant actors and people who were part of that, and part of that Negro Ensemble Theater [Negro Ensemble Company (NEC), New York, New York] and quote "black system of Hollywood" were the first to go in as they should go in.  I did one movie, small brief part in--not 'Let's Happening.'
Speaker 1: 'What's Happening!' or--
Speaker 2: The one with Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby, the first one--
Speaker 1: Oh, 'Uptown'--
Speaker 2: 'Uptown Saturday Night.'  I'm in the opening scene of that.  I'm in about a few scenes, and I sit down with Sidney Poitier, and believe me, all the people in Norfolk [Virginia] went to the movie theater, and before they could sit down and get their popcorn, I was gone.  That's the only one that I did.  I wanted to be in it, but no one--it's funny (laughter), black people didn't think I was black enough 'cause I'm this guy with this white guy doing this sort of heady, kind of interracial comedy.  So when I came to Hollywood in '74 [1974] the first time and '75 [1975], they looked at me like, oh, you--what's this brother doing up here?  He's not part of us.  So I wasn't part of them.  I wasn't taken in.  And we weren't part of the white Hollywood because they were like, why is this white guy, you know.  So it was not, it was not there for me.  And then when I started to work, I broke the, I broke the system.  I didn't--I started out as a standup, but as soon as I start acting.  I remember Richard [Pryor] came to me one night and said, "[HistoryMaker] Tim [Reid], how come you're not working [Las] Vegas [Nevada]?  How come you're not doing it?"  I said, "Richard, man, I don't really like clubs."  He said, "Tim, never give up your stand up."  Well, I gave it up.  I broke the trend.  I decided acting was it for me.  I didn't wanna do clubs.  I didn't wanna do stand up.  Well, that breaks the trend.  So I lost that cache I had in standup comedy, and as an actor, there wasn't that many of us doing acting.

Speaker 2: Occupation, I'm a filmmaker, director, actor, producer--just hustling and hustling (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, well, now, we're completing a interview--we're gonna try to complete an interview that we started last Spring, I believe in 2012 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is the 18th of January, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You're at my film studio, New Millennium Studios, in Petersburg, Virginia.
Story_ID: 293802
Speaker 1: Now, when we left off last time, we were talking about 'WKRP in Cincinnati'--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you talked about the first season and the last episode of that season being a episode where your character, Venus Flytrap [Gordon Sims], reveals something--a secret about himself that had to do with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the Vietnam War, and we, we basically discussed that pretty much.  Is there anything--what about the subsequent seasons of 'WKRP'?  How did the character develop, and how did you feel about the show?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, that show's title was "Who's Gordon Sims?" when he revealed his secret, being a deserter, and the reasons for it, which made it all kinda work out.  It was the show that turned my character around 'cause they were trying to get rid of me 'cause they didn't think I was black enough.  I wasn't, I wasn't street enough.  I wasn't jive enough, and they had wanted this Venus Flytrap character to be more like more Venus Flytrap.  And I was pushing him more like Gordon Sims, the--his real-life character, former schoolteacher.  And that show turned it around.  Mary Tyler Moore was in the audience and saw the performance and came up to me, and she said, "You made me cry.  This is, this is not the kind of thing I expected.  I'm so impressed."  And we got great reviews.  I got personally a great review, and then I got my first acting award, by the way--I don't know if I mentioned that before, by the United States Marine Corps [USMC].  And so it actually made them rethink my character, and in the following seasons, my character began to be a bit more important.  They had a few more shows about it, and they begin to go with the, the sort of discrepancies in the character.  I mean, he was a character trying to find himself.  And we introduced a lot of things out of my personal life.  There's a gong on the set, herbs, I mean, and we're always talking about, you know, esoteric sort of things.  And he was--and he was an interesting character.  And I was going through an interesting change in my life.
Story_ID: 293803
Speaker 1: So you played the character [Gordon "Venus Flytrap" Sims on 'WKRP in Cincinnati'] through 1982.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, now, what did you do next after that--or did the show ['WKRP in Cincinnati'] just kind of--did it have the run that, that the producers, directors expected it to have or--
Speaker 2: No, none of us--that show should have run ten years.  That show was a unique show.  As a matter of fact, the week that we were cancelled, we were number one in America.  The show was cancelled because of political reasons.  We had a, a very--what's the word?  Outspoken producer, a dear friend of mine who I learned so much about producing and directing from and writing, as a matter of fact.  He--Hugh Wilson, was very outspoken, and he wasn't the typical sort of fall-in-line producer.  And there were a lot of conflicts between him and, and network executives.  And that show was really cancelled for political reasons.
Speaker 1: So he clashed with the network.  And that was CBS, right?
Speaker 2: CBS, at the time, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  And, CBS had--
Speaker 2: CBS--
Speaker 1: --was boxing with 'The Smothers Brothers [Comedy Hour'] during those days, too, right?  [A1]
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was, you know, different times, and things they get away on television--get away with in television now, I'm--it makes me gasp sometime, what they say and how they get away.  Back then, I mean, as I mentioned before, even just to wear an earring, I had to go through the--all the way to the board of directors to wear a beard, myself and Ed Bradley, the first to do both, beard and an earring in the history of television, for a black person, person of color.  And so it was a bit different back then.  You didn't--I got a death threat for one of the shows that we did because I jumped up and down and hugged Bailey Quarters, and I think she kissed me on the check.  And we got death threats for, I mean hundreds of letters, so much so that they even brought a bodyguard for me on the set for, for a few days until they felt it was cooled down.  So it was different time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, and I've never been in a show and had it cancelled.  I mean how did you feel as a actor, I mean I guess, people might wanna know how--
Speaker 2: When your show is cancelled, a couple of things happen.  One is your disbelief, because that show was--again, we were high in the ratings.  We had just come back from a trip to South Africa.  It was, it was a shock.  And then what happens is because this was my first continuous series.  I'd been in a lot of short, six episodes of this, but never anything that ran that long.  You, you begin to act as if this is going to be here for a long, long time.  So you, you stretch yourself out beyond your means.  When there's no regular weekly check coming in at the kind of sums that we were making, nowhere near what kids are making now.  But back then, we were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of.  So when that went--just stopped, well, your lifestyle doesn't stop that quickly.  You know, you have to make some quick adjustments.  So I realized then that I didn't like the idea that my fate was being controlled by that sort of whim-ish [ph.] television network standards, or producers' standards, or political reasons.  So I decided that I better protect myself.  And that's when I began to be more interested in producing and creating my own content back then, which was not thought of by many people.  So I began to do that.  There were only a few of us back then doing that.
Story_ID: 293804
Speaker 1: And I began to think about, you know, writing shows for myself and weren't selling anything. And then I got an opportunity to be on another series.  I had just come back from Spain, where I was shooting a project for Bob Guccione, believe it or not.  He (laughter) gave me my first shot (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's Penthouse magazine (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Penthouse magazine.  He gave me my first shot as a producer.  I had, I had produced some music videos for a book of poetry that I wrote, and boy, geez, taking me back.  I had been given the opportunity to make some side money doing an MC and some comedy for what was, was called back then, the Kool Jazz Festival [Newport Jazz Festival], and they would go around America in these baseball stadiums, 50,000 seaters.  And my job was to come out, entertain the audience, do some in between and introduce some incredible acts from Peabo Bryson, you name it, Isley Brothers, you--I can't even begin, Art Blakey, I mean, on and on and on, these incredible artists across the country.  And we did about ten concerts.  So in order to fill that time, I decided to shoot some music videos of some of my poetry, put 'em to music and show them during the halftime in hope of selling some books and some albums and swag.  And I did quite a few of them--did about four or five of 'em, and I would show 'em during the, during the break, between the acts.  And one of them was seen, was shown on--we had a thing back then called Oak Cable.  It was before cable was--cable was just beginning to come into existence.  And they needed a lot of stuff.  All they had was a exercise girl who just would--you'd watch her all day long.  All she did was exercise (laughter).  And someone got a hold of one of mine and showed it on one of the cable networks.  And they didn't even have MTV [Music Television] at that time, by the way.  There were no music video channels, and nothing like that.  And they showed this piece.  Someone saw it, and got it to [Bob] Guccione.  He saw it, and he says, "I like this.  It's sensual, but it's not, it's not, you know, pornographic or anything like that, but I like it.  Bring the guy in."  So I flew to New York [New York], and he handed me his magazine.  He said, "Can you make this suitable for television?"  And I looked through it, and I'm seeing like, I mean it looks like almost, in some cases, raw meat.  And I was like, whoa, I don't know if I can (laughter) make this.  He said, "But take it and write something."  So I took his magazine, and wrote this one-hour cable television show based on Penthouse magazine.  And it took me around the world, to shoot.  And he gave me my first job, gave me a bunch of money and said, "You have my empire, go shoot."  So I was traveling around Spain, of course, New York a lot, shooting in his place, and California, shooting.  And we shot a lot of footage.  And that's how I started as a producer.
Story_ID: 293805
Speaker 1: And then I got worried.  I'm thinking, man, will I get back into network television if people see I'm doing this kind of stuff (laughter)?  But it's [Penthouse magazine] how I got started as a producer.
Speaker 2: Well, that's quite a way to get started.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.  It was--for me, I mean I learned a lot, and, again, traveling and being exposed to different situations.  I had, you know, a small, small group to travel with me.  My son saw his first naked woman (laughter).  We were shooting, and he was--I didn't realize he was on the set.  I'm going, "What are you doing?"  And he's, his eyes were like (laughter), like an owl (laughter).  But--
Speaker 2: So what was the series called? (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was, it was a, it was literally a one-hour--now, it would be nothing.  But it was a one-hour show based on the Penthouse magazine, and it was 'Penthouse To Video' [ph.], and we did some--we tried to follow the magazine format that it had, the kind of things it had in the magazine, but in a different way.  We tried to--instead of having it--it was very soft and nothing, really, that you wouldn't, you couldn't see today and just about, you know, anywhere at prime time.  But, but back then, to take that magazine and attempt to do that was really out there.
Speaker 2: I know one of the early programs on cable--well, they had a Playboy channel [The Playboy Channel; Playboy TV] at one time.  I don't know if they still have it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: But was Bob Guccione trying to have a Penthouse channel?
Speaker 1: Yes, he was trying to have a Penthouse channel.  The whole idea was he was gonna go from that--I'll launch this and become, you know, compete with [Hugh] Heffner and the TV market.  They all saw this cable thing as a future opportunity.  But he got caught up in some legal problems. The--and they locked up everything we shot.  And only one piece of it ever got seen.  He put it on one of his DVDs.  He did a thing on behind-the-scenes of 'Caligula,' and he had two of the things that I had shot sort of mixed up in that.  I'm going, I'm with 'Caligula'? (Laughter).  So, but other than that all the stuff we shot, I mean never, never was seen.
Story_ID: 293806
Speaker 1: Now, you appeared, I think in, in 'Simon & Simon,' that was the next big series, right? (Unclear).
Speaker 2: No, actually, after, after I did 'KRP' ['WKRP in Cincinnati'], and I did producing for, for about a year, maybe six months to a year, I got a call to come and do a show called 'Teachers Only'--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to co-star with Lynn Redgrave, Norman Fell, Theresa Ganzel, Jean Smart Brooks, and myself.  It was about teachers at a school, behind the scenes of this school, and the teachers and what they went through, and it was a comedy for NBC.  And we did thirteen episodes of that, and we were all pleased that it didn't get picked up 'cause it was, it was not well written, and it was a very difficult time for us to try to--who wanted more, and with such a great cast.  I mean, my God, it was a wonderful cast.  Norman Fell and I became very--became very good friends.  And that was one, and, of course, Lynn Redgrave.  So--but it saved me, and I got married.  I promised my then-fiancee [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid] that if I got a series, we'd get married.  And I made the promise at the airport.  I'd just come from Ma--from Madrid [Spain].  And she met me.  She surprised me.  We had had a fight, and I said, "It's over."  And I left and went to Spain.  When I came back, I landed at the airport in New York [New York].  I walked out and she was there.  And those are the days you didn't--you could go right up the people coming off.  (Laughter) And so I went, "Why are you here?"  And we talked, and I realized, I said, "You know what?  This is silly.  I mean, I'm not ready to go back into the gene pool.  Let's do this."  And she said, "Let's do this."  And I said, "The only--definitely, but we have to have one thing.  I will not get married 'til I get a series, and we can go on a big honeymoon," 'cause I had never had a big honeymoon.  "And the kids have got to agree," which was kinda iffy on both parts.  So she said, "I agree".  And I get to the air--I come, I get in the cab.  We drive back to Manhattan [New York, New York].  I go to the hotel where I'm staying.  As I walk in, someone said, "Are you Mr. Reid?"  I--"Yes."  He says, "We have a message for you."  So I took the message.  It was my manager, Jan McCormick at the time.  And she says, "We need you in Hollywood [California] immediately."  She said, "Where are you?"  I said, "I just come back from Madrid."  She said, "We need you out here.  Can you get out here tonight?"  I said, "What do you mean?"  Says, "A show, NBC."  I said, "I'm not coming all the way out there to audition for no comedy.  You kidding me?"  She says, "Who said audition?  They want you to start work.  They need you here tomorrow to fit and medical."  And I was like, "Are you kidding me?"  She said, "No."  (Laughter) So I hung up my phone and looked at my--"Daphne," I said, "I got a series."  She said, "Well, let me start planning the wedding," (laughter).  And that's how I got married (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.
Story_ID: 293807
Speaker 1: Now, you played [HistoryMaker] Robert Guillaume's [Benson DuBois] brother [Russell DuBois] in 'Benson'--
Speaker 2: In 'Benson.'
Speaker 1: --in one episode ["Thy Brother's Keeper"] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, one episode.
Speaker 1: And a memorable episode at that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--I played his brother in 'Benson.'  It was great.  You know, back then, it was, it was only a few of us, a handful of us out working regularly in Hollywood at the time.  And so we'd often bump into one another and be working on different shows.  And it was a little close-knit operation back then.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the series was 'Simon & Simon,' right?
Speaker 2: Well, after, after 'Teachers Only'--
Speaker 1: Oh, after 'Teachers Only'--
Speaker 2: --then, then came 'Simon & Simon.'
Speaker 1: So, your wedding [with HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid], your--
Speaker 2: That got us married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then after that was canceled, I did some more producing, and then a friend of mine, who was a writer for the show ['Simon & Simon'], Bill Dodd, who had been one of the writers on 'WKRP in Cincinnati,' called me and says, "We got an idea for a character.  His name is [Lt.] Marcel Pruce Brown, we call him, 'Downtown' Brown."  I said, "Will you ever get me a show where the name is simple?"  (Laughter) And anyway, I went on that show for four years, and it was a wonderful experience being on quasi-drama, sort of light, lighthearted drama.  And I was able to write for it, and I wrote about four episodes.  And it was one of the best jobs that I ever had in terms of the ease and not a lot of pressure.  Those guys had a very difficult day every day, but it was easy for me.  I'd show up two or three days a week, and they were paying me good money.  And it was a wonderful four years.
Story_ID: 293808
Speaker 1: And then I realized in doing 'Simon & Simon,' about the end of it, I said, you know, I could probably spend the rest of my life in this town, playing second cop or sidekick.  I said, but I want my own show.  I want that feeling of having my own show.  And so I went to the producers--and 'Beverly Hills Cop' had been very successful.  I said, "Why don't we spin off 'Downtown' Brown to La Jolla [San Diego, California], and give him a white sidekick."  I said, "And let's do a sort of a knockoff of 'Beverly Hills Cop' in La Jolla."  And they said, "Okay."  I said, "Well, let me write the episode."  So I wrote an episode that would have been the pilot episode, the spin-off of the character.  And it was the last episode of the fourth season.  And they said, "We like this."  So they agreed to do the, the spin-off.  And, but they had to take it to some executive, and the executive looked at it and said, "It's nice, but, ah, let him stay here.  I don't see this guy. He couldn't--this guy couldn't possibly have his own show."  And they said, "But it's, it's a--we don't even have to spin.  It's a pilot.  We don't have to spin it, I mean you don't have to pay for it.  You're gonna--it's the last episode, and then, you know, the gamble on, on doing maybe four or five, or something."  "Nah, he can't do it."  So when I heard that, I got a little, a little ticked.  I said, "Okay."  I said, "I'll tell you what, guys, I've gotta make a decision.  I wanna gamble.  I think I can do my own show.  And I just don't wanna be second banana for the rest of my career.  If I stay in this, that's what I'm gonna be."  Said, "What are you gonna do?"  I said, "I quit.  And you (unclear)," I said--"We can, we can replace you in, in an hour."  I said, "I know you can.  Thank you.  Will you let me out of the contract?"  "Yeah, you can go."  So I left the show, and sat down with my friend, Hugh Wilson.  We had worked together on 'KRP' ['WKRP in Cincinnati'], and I said, "Hugh, I got a idea for a show.  Let's work together again. I like your writing."  Said, "What do you wanna do?"  I said, "I don't know.  I wanna do something.  I wanna own a--my father [William Reid] owned a bar, and I wanna get into that side."  He said, "Where?"  I said, "I don't know, somewhere.  Memphis [Tennessee] or somewhere out of the--in the South.  We're both Southerners."  So we went to network, pitched it, and they said, "You and Hugh Wilson?"  "Yes."  "Where do you wanna put it?"  And one of the guys in the room said, "You know, my brother owns a restaurant based on New Orleans [Louisiana] cooking."  And we went, "New Orleans.  Yeah."  So Hugh and I got on the plane and we went down to New Orleans and spent a week there, walking around, just trying to find where was the show?  Where would it be?  And out of that came the concept for 'Frank's Place,' which was probably the best thing I've ever done in television.
Story_ID: 293809
Speaker 1: Let me say this, that 'Frank's Place,' I was--at the time I worked at a theater [ETA Creative Arts Foundation], black theater group in Chicago [Illinois].  And the members of the group--that was their--the only thing they watched on TV was 'Frank's Place.'  They talked about it all the time.  The director, you know, said, you know, she just praised you up and down (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think it was--
Speaker 1: --"Tim Reid has done something, you know, special."
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was one of the most unique experiences I've ever had in my life, creatively and also culturally.  It gave me an opportunity--I mean (laughter)--I don't know if you wanna jump in this, but I--the show was very personal to myself and Hugh Wilson in a sense that it gave us an opportunity to look at the South in a different way, a more loving way, and also, for me, my culture in a more loving way.  The people that you see in 'Frank's Place' were people in my life like that, characters.  I came from that kind of a culture, that kind of a segregated, colored town.  I mean that's where I grew up.  My grandmother [Beulah Reid] ran a boarding house.  My aunt had one of the largest whorehouses in Norfolk [Virginia] during the, during the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] until I was about nine.  So I had this kinda interesting cultural experience that I wanted to somehow bring to television.  So those characters that you see in 'Frank's' and the stories and what we talked about were a lot of he and I talking about the black culture, the way I knew it, and the way he had experienced it in his lives.  So we did the show.  And I often wondered what television would look like when it comes to black characterizations had 'Frank's Place' gone four or five years.  I don't think TV would look the same from a black perspective had we stayed on four or five years.  You couldn't go back to where we've gone back to if, if 'Frank's Place' had stayed on four or five years.  There's no way you could regress that far into the characterization, the buffoonishness, the, the sort of, you know, we're back to the future.  I mean we're back to that era that we all tried to write ourselves out of and perform ourselves out of.  We're back there, and we're now in the form of reality shows, you know, these people performing badly, this sort of silly, sick cultural degration--degradation, rather, that we see in these characters and how people, I mean how little love people show of their own culture and their own character, how easy it is to, to say and act with such foolishness that is an insult to humanity.  I don't think that would have been possible had 'Frank's Place' stayed on more than three or four years.  There's just no way.  I, I just can't conceive that it would go--
Story_ID: 293810
Speaker 1: What were some of the aspects of 'Frank's Place' that you tweaked that were different from what the usual sitcom would, would have?  I mean (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) God, I mean there're--it's like--we could almost do--matter of fact, there have been college courses on, on that particular subject, how different was that show compared to what was being shown, in terms of black characterizations, and also, black-white relationships in the South and the North.  Well, one of the--first glaring one that most people didn't accept it, didn't pay much attention to, was the multi-generational aspects of the black community.  I mean we had a character on there, who at the time we hired her, was like seventy-something years old.  I mean she could barely move about without the aid of cane, and, and she is one of the most dramatic and most interesting women I've ever met in my life, Miss Marie, Frances Williams.  She studied with [Konstantin] Stanislavski.  She had, she had been befriended and been a partner of Paul Robeson.  She had, she and he had hid out from--in Mexico for years when he was being--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --(laughter) chased by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  She had, she had given [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou her start.  She started--this woman was a, unbelievable woman, and here she is playing this, this waitress emeritus who only waited on people who had been coming there thirty years or more.  And you have her.  You have Mr. Charlie Lampkin, one of the best jazz musicians who had been forgotten in the era of jazz, and different man, I mean unusual character, who would sit and tell stories off, off the set about the great days of, of Hollywood--not only Hollywood, music and working in Paris [France].  And then we had, you know, Big Arthur, had just been in, you know, a hit from 'Rocky.'  I mean we had these interest--then we had this, one of the first times you ever saw a Jewish, Southern lawyer in a series, you know, played by [Robert] Harper, Bubba Weisberger [Bubba "Si" Weisberger], I mean (laughter), I mean it was really a multi-generational, young, old, middle aged, all these characters from different lifestyles.  I'm an educated college professor, but I didn't know diddly from these people.  They were, they were earth, street, you know, people who lived by their, their wits and their, and their ability to survive.  And so we were able to deal with a different kind of story in a different way.  I haven't seen the multi-generational storytelling in television since.  I'm seeing a little more in, in some of the white stories--white sitcoms, in 'Modern Family,' a few of 'em where you're beginning, you get a little more multi-generational.  But we see it in Europe all the time.  I spent a lot of time in Europe and Italy.  You see multi-generational stories.  You see it in Brazil, but in America, we, we shy away from multi-generalization in terms of storytelling or multi-generations coming together and, and existing as it is in real life.
Story_ID: 293811
Speaker 1: How was 'Frank's Place' shot?  It was shot differently than other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we shot three-camera film.  We shot films, one-camera, two-camera films I should say.  And we shot without an audience, four walls.  We built a set that looked like a restaurant, felt like a restaurant.  We didn't, you know, we got rid of the laugh track.  Actually, the show got rid of it by itself.  It just didn't fit.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I was gonna mention that.  I couldn't remember if it did.  My memory was that it didn't have one, laugh track.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Didn't, it didn't fit.  We tried it.  It didn't fit.  And we, we defined, along with one other show called, 'The Wonder Years, I think, we defined the term dramedy, 'cause that's really what it was.  It was a dramedy.  And it actually was a thing that haunted me for many years.  You know, you're that guy that wanna do that sort of soft stuff, you know.  But, yeah, it was a unique show.  It dealt with, I think, the black culture in a way that still, to this day, has not been touched in television, in sitcoms for sure and in very few dramas.  I think it was honest to the culture in ways that have rarely been seen.  We talked about race among blacks in terms of the brown paper bag test.  We talked about (laughter) blacks and Jews.  We talk--I mean the first Hanukkah celebration, I think that was ever seen in a sitcom, was on our show.  I went--I mean it was, we (laughter) just did some most unusual--the show that won the Emmy [Award] for Hugh [Wilson], his writing, was a show about a suicide, a black man committing suicide, in a comedy?  And yet, it's a riveting show, called "The Bridge" ['Frank's Place'].  So it was, it was a show that--we had Dizzy Gillespie.  I mean we had, we had people on that show--people would call and say, "Can I be on that show?"  And names, (laughter) Don King, Joe Frazier, I mean people would come and sit down on the set and, and Joe Frazier and Don King just showed up one day and just to be on the set (laughter) and waving.  I mean it was just, it was that kind of thing, you know.  It was a unique experience and one that I will never forget.  I would have, man, it would have been great to see it go beyond one year.
Story_ID: 293812
Speaker 1: Twenty-two [episodes] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now it ['Frank's Place'] was on--I can't remember the network now, but--
Speaker 1: CBS.
Speaker 2: CBS, okay.
Speaker 1: Moved, I think sixteen times in, in twenty-two episodes (laughter).  You think they tried to lose it (laughter)?  It got me a meeting with, in a meeting out at, that sort of--again, one of those eventful meetings.  I was in New York [New York] at Black Rock, CBS headquarters, showing the show, I'm promoting it.  And I wanted to show it to the employees of CBS 'cause I knew they would be the ones responsible for putting ads together.  So I said, why don't I go up there and show it during their lunch break.  So we went up, and I went out and spoke and then showed the show around the cafeteria at CBS.  And William [S.] Paley was alive at the time, up in his, his penthouse office, and he got wind that I was there.  And he asked to see me, which just sent shockwaves throughout the, the building because he hadn't seen an actor in ten years.  And, and so (laughter) I had to go through debriefing like I was going to see the president of the United States, and they debriefed me for about forty-five minutes, and myself, and then the president of CBS--I think it was O'Leary at the time.  But, anyway, we went up to this floor, and I will never forget.  It was just like the movie with, with George Clooney in 'Good Night, [and Good Luck'], about Edward R. Murrow.  There's a scene where they go to see William Paley.  And it's just like that scene, except it was in color 'cause I was in color (laughter).  And this room, the size of a basketball court, with one desk, with a nice lady sitting behind it, a sofa, a chair, some plants and incredible paintings, and that's it.  I mean you can act--you hear echoes in this room (laughter).  This was his waiting room.  One elevator that goes only there and down--at the top of Black Rock.  And you sit there, and then you, you're ushered into his office.  And there must have been at that time--the value of today would be 250 million [dollars].  But it must have been about $8 million worth of art, there's a [Auguste] Rodin in the corner, a [Pablo] Picasso, I mean paintings and it was just like, my God.  And I recognized a few.  I think he was impressed with that.  My wife [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid] and I going, that's a--and we had just come back from France, and I had just seen--at the Rodin Museum, I went, that's a Rodin.  He says, "Oh."  So that kinda caught him off guard (laugher).  And then we sat down, and we talked a brief minute.  And he, he said something to me that I speak about now with my group.  I have a Legacy Media Institute and I tell these young filmmakers that W.E.B DuBois--two people made me understand something.  One was W.E.B. DuBois, the other was William Paley, and that is, all art is propaganda.  And the reason why I say William Paley because in the meeting, he says, "I've seen your show, young man.  I like your show.  I would have been proud to have it on the network when I was running it."  He said, "I have one question to ask you."  I said, "What is that, sir?"  He said, "What is your propaganda?"  And I was like, "Excuse me?"  (Laughter) I can't believe this man just asked me that.  And I went, "Well, sir, my propaganda is this.  I come from a very rich black culture, very rich, born in segregation, poverty,"  I said, "but my people that I grew up with, they were survivors."  They were rich in character."  I said, "They ran the, the baker's, baker's store."  I mentioned so many characters.  I said, "From the preacher to the, you name it, the hustler in the street." I said, "They were business people.  They were survivors."  Interesting.  I've never seen 'em on television.  I said, "the people I see on television are not people I grew up with.  I don't know these people."  I said, "my goal is to show a little bit of my culture, the way I know it to be."  I said, "It has nothing to do with race or white or black.  It has to do with this rich culture I had the pleasure of growing up in, in Church Street in Norfolk, Virginia."  He said, "I like that.  Are your writers gonna stay with you?"  I say, "Yes, sir."  He says, "Good."  And that's how, you know, I learned that lesson about propaganda from him.
Story_ID: 296838
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-seven [1987].  This is, as I said, and I'm gonna mention their names, Abena Joan Brown [HistoryMaker Abena Joan P. Brown] of the ETA Creative Arts Foundation [Chicago, Illinois] and the whole board and network of the Midwest African-American Theater Alliance used to discuss this show ['Frank's Place'].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, 1987, everybody was heartbroken when the show--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was cancelled.  Now, this meeting with, with William [S.] Paley--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds, it sounds as if he wants to continue the show (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Well what happened, what happened?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  No question.  William Paley loved the show and was, was a champion of the show.  This was at the beginning.  The show hadn't aired yet.  He'd only seen the pilot episode.  That's why he asked me, "Your writers gonna stay?"  "Yes, sir, the writers are gonna stay."  "Good."  And then the show aired, and, of course, the ratings were iffy because people didn't know what the show was.  And I--even black people were afraid of it.  I remember getting a, a letter from a lady.  She was like, "Oh, my God, young man.  What are you--I mean are you sure you wanna do this?"  I mean it made for the--because they had not seen it before.  Where is he going with this?  This is dangerous.  Are you giving away secrets?  I mean it was really (laughter), it was very interesting, the response we got.  The network (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Giving away secrets?  I mean what, now (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean it's like we touched the culture.  We touched the, the--I wouldn't say we didn't, I mean I'm gonna be realistic here.  We didn't reveal something that wasn't ever known, but I think in television folklore, very few people had come that close to revealing a bit of black lifestyle in America in television, in a half hour, the way we were doing it, the richness of the culture.  And I think it made some people, white and black, a bit uncomfortable.  It made some people go, "My God, oh, my"--you know, like sometimes you go, "Oh, boy, this is too good.  Don't make it, don't, don't get in any trouble.  Oh."  You want it to have and you think the worse 'cause it's like--say, "I like this.  This can't be.  This won't make it 'cause it's too good."  All that.  So I think the first few weeks of the show, it was, it was frustrating for a lot of Americans to figure out what it--the show is about.  There's no laugh track.  What do we do?  Then around about halfway through the show, and they were moving us, trying to find an audience.  They didn't know how to promote it.  How do you promote it?  Who do you promote it to?  Who's this for?  And so it was a difficult marketing thing for the network.  They didn't know how to market it.  They didn't know the culture.  I mean New Orleans [Louisiana], and gumbo and lagniappe and the--what did it mean?  You know, we almost--matter of fact, we even, (laughter) we even begin to subtitle one of the characters who spoke Cajun--a Cajun dialect.  We actually put subtitles down because they were--the network's [CBS] complaining.  Nobody can understand him.  All right, we'll put subtitles.  So we put (laughter) subtitles.  It was, the music and all the stuff was just frustrating for the network.  So every day there were meetings and sending people over and all that.  And Hugh [Wilson], and I would, you know, stand up as much as we could and fight.  But it began to wear us down.
Story_ID: 296839
Speaker 1: They [CBS] didn't really know what to do with the show ['Frank's Place'].  So they would, they were asking, "How do we do, where do we promote it?"  And then the show began to, to get interestingly, critics, academics and critics began to say, wait a minute, this is--The Wall Street Journal was writing these wonderful articles, '[CBS News] Sunday Morning.' Charles Kuralt, I mean people were saying, "Wait a minute.  I've just seen something here that's--this is out of the usual.  What's going on with this show?"  And that began to perk 'em up, and they go, "Whoa, wait a minute."  Not the audience we suspected, but certainly this critical acclaim here, and, I mean I can show you a book that thick with critical acclaim.  So at that time, we began to--we kept on our, on our track.  And we were doing interesting shows.  But one day, Hugh [Wilson] came to me with a show about Wall Street.  And it was a show that sort of went after the new thing in Wall Street that began the cliff down.  It began the spiral that we've come to now.  It began to break at the, to reveal the greed and the outright thievery of the financial system as it has become known for now.  And that was junk bonds, junk bonds (laughter).  Junk bonds began to proliferate, the whole concept of junk bonds began to proliferate, and people were buying companies with junk and nothing.  I mean they were--and maneuvering (laughter).  And CBS was bought out.  And it was bought out through some incredible financing matters and, and junk bonds were involved.  And Hugh got very angry.  So he wrote a show [sic. episode] called, "The King of Wall Street," and 'Ragtime' had just come out and been very popular, had been up--I think it had won a couple Oscars [Academy Awards]--I forgot.  And there was a gentleman in the show called, that's no longer with us, the late Kenny McIn--Kevin McIntyre [sic.] who was nominated, I think, for an Oscar.  And we sent him the script.  Hugh wanted this guy to play this, this Wall Street guy.  The guy came back.  He says, "I wanna do this show."  And he says, "I have never in all my days of acting had words like this."  So we decided to do this show called "King of Wall Street."  And the premise of the show was this banker, this maneuvering financial kingpin, was down in New Orleans [Louisiana] to do some business deals, and after the business, came down in a private jet and they were in a bunch of limousines with his young, cohorts.  And he says, "I want some of that soul food.  I wanna go to that place where the--and get some of that good ole New Orleans."  So they took him to my restaurant, at Frank's Place (laughter).  And he gets there, and my chef is off, and it's just a bad night to be there.  But he gets there, and while he's there, something happens that has happened in Wall Street many times.  He's dethroned, literally.  He gets a phone call and they said, "You have been dethroned.  You're no longer the CEO of this company.  They've had a coup while you were gone.  You're out.  Turn your keys over."  And all of the little, young henchmen, when he says, "He's out", they got up and left, took the limousine (laughter), took the private jet and left him at my restaurant.  And he and I were now two guys, who are now basically, don't have a clue what's going on in the world.  And he starts this soliloquy that went on for about five pages about what's wrong with the financial world, and, and I just remember--God, the words were unbelievable.  I just had like a few lines going "Uh-huh, yes, well, you know" (laughter).  But it was an incredible performance, and, and I remember one line.  He says, he says, "My great-great-grandfather made chairs.  And his father before him made chairs."  He says, "I sit in the chair that was made by my great-great-grandfather.  It's a fine craftsmanship."  He said, "He got--and back in those days roughly, the equivalent of twelve dollars or fifteen dollars for a chair."  He said, "But the work he put in that craftsmanship.  He made the best chair in this community we lived in.  And people are sitting in his chairs today.  They're valuable chairs, worth thousands of dollars."  He says, "I make nothing."  He says, "I sell junk.  I make more in one ounce of a minute of a phone call, the entire generations of my family who made chairs."  He says, "And I make nothing.  I add no value to anything.  I just make a transaction.  I don't create anything, but a movement of Xs and Os.  And, yet, I'm worth millions."  You know, it was just an incredible statement of where we had come financially.  It happened to be the wrong statement to make at the time (laughter) when everybody in Wall Street is going, "Ya ha, green is good."

Speaker 1: So then-owner and president of the network [CBS] didn't see it ["The King of Wall Street" episode on 'Frank's Place'] the first time.  And the next time around, before a board meeting--they had board meetings every Tuesday.  And on Tuesdays--we were on Mondays at that time.  The board would always start the board meeting talking about, "Did you see 'Frank's Place' last night?"  And I know this because Walter Cronkite told me this (laughter).  He said--and, well, anyway, how I found out about what went on was, everybody tried to get them not to cancel the show.  We had actually been picked up for the second season, but most people don't know we were picked up.  We were picked up for the second season.  We were cancelled one day before we were to shoot the first episode of 'Frank's Place,' one day.  Sets were being built.  I, you know, this was--the cast was there.  And we were cancelled because he saw that episode, and he says, "I will not have a show of mine on this network that I own and I bought go after my business and my profession the way this show has."  And he used a four-letter word to tell us his sentiments (laughter), and said, "Cancel it."  We were gone.  And it, it was--you know, it's an interesting thing.  I understand, and in a way, I understood his sentiment for sure.  I didn't like it.  So anyway, I, I refused to go quietly, and I, I made, did a few maneuvers and got the opportunity to get a guaran- not a guaranteed, but a, a guaranteed of two pilots, a half hour and an hour.  I developed two pilots at the same time, a hour and a half hour to make sure that I would get on, get on the air and get my payoff, because they had to pay me off plus, there were some commitments made that were not honored.  So anyway, I did a hour show and a half hour show, and they picked up the hour show for thirteen, called 'Snoops.'  So I was back in New York [New York], back in the Black Rock [CBS Building], promoting 'Snoops,' and we'd gone in, promoted 'Snoops,' 'cause they were still fans of mine from 'Frank's Place.'  I come out of the building.  I'm walking down the street, and I hear somebody call my name, "[HistoryMaker] Tim Reid."  And I said, "That's Walter Cronkite.  He knows my name."  (Laughter) I was like, it's like the voice of god.  I turned around and there was Walter Cronkite.  He said, "Mr. Reid, may I speak with you?"  I'm going, "Yes, sir," (laughter), "you may speak with me," (laughter).  He said, "Let's go in."  We went in 21 [21 Club, New York, New York].  It was right next to the building.  We go in.  We go up to the bar.  My wife [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid] was with me.  He said, "Young man, you're owed an explanation."  And he told me this story.  He said, "We were at a board meeting, and, and we, we always spoke of your show."  He says, "Your show was one of the most loved shows by the board of directors, and this is what happened, and this is why you're not on the air."  And I says, "Business."  And I understood (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) coming from Walter Cronkite, that kind of--
Speaker 1: Business (laughter).  But it was business.  And so I used that.  When I went back into, to, you know, 'cause everybody wanted me to go after 'em with a lawsuit.  I mean it was a lot of talk going on about what I should do with what had happened and how it happened, you know, racially--I mean it was everything, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], everybody was saying we should do something.  And I said, you know, I've been in this battle, it'll be a long time now.  I'm gonna see, I'm gonna do what they do.  I'm gonna play this game businesswise.  I'm going the business way.  I have a commitment and I wanna see that they honor this commitment.  So I went back and said, "Guys, with anybody, you've got a guaranteed thirteen, and these guys, you take care of 'em.  I expect to be taken care of."  And I don't think people had really been approached that way before (laughter).  But anyway, Howard Stringer and Kim LeMasters and a few other executives in network, they were very fair.  They said, "We can get you on the air.  You get thirteen."  And I got thirteen.  I bought the farm [in Charlottesville, Virginia] (laughter).  But--
Speaker 2: Interesting.
Speaker 1: --I learned a lot about the business, I can tell you that (laughter).
Story_ID: 296841
Speaker 1: Did you all do any research in New Orleans [Louisiana] in terms of restaurants down there and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we spent a lot of time in New Orleans.  We went to every kind of restaurant, from Brennan's [New Orleans, Louisiana], the top of line, from Dooky Chase [Dooky Chase's Restaurant, New Orleans, Louisiana], to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah Chez Helene [New Orleans, Louisiana], and we picked Chez Helene.  And the reason we picked Chez Helene, Dooky Chase was, was far more the most well-known, and, and certainly upper class and credible.  But it was too upscale for our writing points.  I mean the--this was supposed to be a fish out of water, a guy whose father has been struggling in a restaurant.  We went in Chez Helene (laughter), and, ah, his name just jumped out of my head, Austin Leslie, who was the owner of the restaurant, had on a little, yachting cap as one of the characters, Big Arthur, had in our pilot [for 'Frank's Place'].  It was right after--based on Chez Helene.  And there was an old lady sitting on the corner at the register and she only waited on people who had been coming there for a while.  And there was this young brash waitress and a young kid working their kitchen.  And we looked around--small place.  It's about as big as this room.  And the food was excellent, and he was in charge, and he was cooking and shouting orders, and you could feel--and it was in the community.  I mean it was in a community.  It was, it was anchored in the kind of community, and the people--somebody from the post office was sitting there and somebody in a suit was sitting there.  And you had a young kid with his parents.  I'm saying, this is a true black--I remember this.
Speaker 1: Was that like Ninth Ward, New Orleans (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and I remember this--not too far from Dooky Chase's, just, I said, this is--I know this place.  I, I've eaten in this place as a child (laughter), but it was in Norfolk, Virginia.  I mean one colored town.  They all seemed to have those same similar kind of cultural, security elements.  I said, "This is the place."  Hugh [Wilson] said, "Yeah, this is the place."  And so we picked Chez Helene as our model, and from then, we began to go around the community.  We spent a lot of time in New Orleans.  We'd go back and forth.  Whenever we got short of a show, we weren't sure which way to go with it an episode, we'd put the writer on the plane and fly him to New Orleans.  Just go hang out in New Orleans for a week, talk to some people.  Here's some people.  Call the, call the people over at the funeral home and hang out with 'em.  He'd come back.  The story would be better.  New Orleans was--we wanted to make sure that New Orleans was not only true to itself as much as we could make it with what we were doing, but that we had a sense of what the culture of New Orleans was like, I mean the people.  And New Orleans is a fascinating, unique place.  There's no place like it on this planet.
Speaker 1: Before we did this interview, before I saw all the biographical information on you, I thought you might have been from New Orleans.
Speaker 2: No, I tell you what though.  I had, 'til this day, if you ask me to name the top five events in my life, one of 'em would have been the two weeks I spent in New Orleans back in the early '70s [1970s], performing at the New Orleans Playboy Club [New Orleans, Louisiana].  I had two weeks that (laughter), I feel in love with New Orleans and the people, and it was incredible.  I've been all over the world, and I don't think I've ever spent--very few places, a few, but, you know, very few places that, that could rival the, the two weeks I spent in New Orleans back in '71 [1971].  And it was in my blood.  I said, oh, yes, I've gotta do something with this place.  I've gotta figure out how to do something in this place.  And I still feel that way about New Orleans.  I haven't gotten it out of my system.
Story_ID: 296842
Speaker 1: With 'Frank's Place,' did any, any of the other networks wanna pick it up or (unclear)--
Speaker 2: They were afraid.  I mean when the head of a network says, "The hammer's down," you got to be a pretty strong puppy to go in there and bark at that dog (laughter).  It was--nobody wanted to touch it.  Word was out.  This did not please the, the powers that be--
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't remember in those days what the status of CBS was.  I know the major networks were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was doing well.  It was--
Speaker 1: --you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: --it was in the top one or two at the time.  I mean it--yeah, it was business.  Now, I mean, certainly didn't play out in my favor, but once you--you know, every--I've been blessed and myself and a few, a few people over the--back then, more today, but back then are allowed in the inner room.  When I say the inner room, I mean to see how business is really run, to see the power that exists in that vacuum and how they use that power, how they punish, how they reward.  You rarely see that, and I, I was offered a glimpse at that, at that world at that time.  And I thought, oh, I can play here.  This is--I--this game, I'm not afraid of this game.  I'm not afraid of these people.  I was prepared well in that little black community of mine [in Norfolk, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Well, one of the--I know you received awards.  You received an Image Award from NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] for this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --which is, you know, NAACP has been known to give awards to people who donated the most money--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But in this case, that's not the case.  That's not true.
Speaker 2: No, it--
Speaker 1: So you got an award, you know, based on the merit of something you did.  And the theater people that I know in Chicago [Illinois], they--we discussed it once.  We were in discussion once at a conference and the conclusion was, is that you saw black people and you saw, underneath everything they were doing, a mind thinking.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you we saw that, and, in fact, all the characters really, were thinking.
Speaker 2: Thinking people, yeah.
Speaker 1: They weren't just shooting one-liners at each other.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they weren't afraid--I mean they weren't afraid.  They weren't afraid.  The characters weren't afraid, and the people, the actors playing them were not afraid.  Miss Marie [Frances E. Williams] had no fear in her heart at all about anything.  I remember she said (laughter)--one day she saw me in the heat of battle with, with some--something with the network.  And I don't know what they came to, to try to get me to bend to do, but I wouldn't do it, and it was pretty heated.  And when they left, she looked at me, and she said, "Come here, boy."  She said, "I like you.  You're feisty." (Laughter) I mean it was like the kiss.  I felt like (laughter) the, the ancestors had embraced me, say, "I like you, you feisty," (laughter).
Story_ID: 296843
Speaker 1: It was an inspirational show ['Frank's Place'], and the reverberations of it are still--is it available now in any form where people can (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They won't let me have it.  There're a couple issues.  One is the music.  Its cost--it would cost about a million-six [$1.6 million] to clear the music for distribution.  Networks won't pick it up.  It is playing occasionally in London [England], in Europe.  Yeah, I go over there every now and then, and somebody say, "I just saw this show about the restaurant.  It's very different."  And I show it occasionally when I travel.  I've shown it in Nigeria.  I've shown it in, in Cuba.  I've shown it in Brazil, you know, and to small groups.  I take it around sometime.  Every now and then, I'll go to New Orleans [Louisiana], and I'll have, for a fundraiser for a couple organizations down there, we'll put on a 'Frank's Place' night.  And I'll show three episodes, and we do a little discussion.  One of the most heart-warming events was, I went down about two years ago--I did the first couple episodes, of the first season of 'Treme.'  And we put on a show, and the producers from 'Treme,' David [Simon] and the rest of 'em, brought us down, myself and Hugh Wilson.  And we put on this (laughter), this show.  And we showed the opening episode to this audience, and packed house, by the way.  They, they sold out the house, and they had to get another room and put closed-circuit TV in.  And when the opening titles came on, there was this incredible emotion in the audience.  And I went, wow, listen, this is the opening titles.  We haven't even gotten to the first episode, the episode footage.  And what we discovered was, these were the descendants of the people who were no longer with us, who were in the opening titles.  And they had come there to see their uncle, to see their mother, their father, whoever these pictures were, the places.  All these people are gone.  And they were sitting there, and these were the descendants of these people.  And one of the episodes that we showed was about a health inspector.  It was a funny episode, whereas they had a dead body.  It was based on a joke that I knew, and I told Hugh, and we wrote this episode.  But (laughter) a guy stood up and asked a question.  He says, "I was the health inspector for Chez Helene [New Orleans, Louisiana]," (laughter).  I mean it was just incredible characters who found association of themselves in the show who came or the descendants of people who were in the opening titles.  It was an amazing night.  I won't, I won't ever forget that.
Story_ID: 296844
Speaker 1: How many episodes did 'Snoops' run?
Speaker 2: 'Snoops' ran thirteen, and 'Snoops' was a bit of a disappointment for me, but not in terms of--like 'Frank's Place.' It was a disappointment that I wouldn't be allowed to do a show like that.  Now, you gotta remember, when 'Snoops,'--when we did 'Snoops' in '88 [sic. 1989], I think it was, it was my reward for, for what happened with 'Frank's Place.'  I got the idea--this is a true story.  I got the idea--I was on vacation in Harbour Island in the Bahamas, a little secluded one in the most beautiful, beautiful little spots, pink sand beaches.  And there was (laughter) a little 'ole white lady would run by every day jogging.  I'm going, who is this little old lady who's out here.  And then I saw another one that looked like her.  I go, what's--and I stopped 'em one day and found out they were sisters.  Oh, what are their names?  Twiggy [ph.], Ziggy [ph.], it was some silly playful names.  And I said, well, who are you?  One of 'em was a doctor in Harlem [New York, New York] at a hospital.  The other one worked for the state department [U.S. Department of State], had just retired.  She had gone with Skip [ph.] to, to China for--and she helped work the Marshall Plan.  I mean, this was an incredible woman who had this political background, had traveled the world, had worked on some of the major, major treaties and things under, under several presidents.  And she had retired.  She said, "I worked at the state department."  And so she would--we sat down and start talking to them on--they'd run by and stop with us and tell me these stories.  And I looked, and I says, "Wow."  So when she left, I told Daphne [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid], I said, I wanna do a show where your character works at the state department.  I'm a criminologist.  So I sat down.  I said, but I want it to be like, geez, the name just--Myrna Loy and [William] Powell--
Speaker 1: Oh, 'The Thin Man.'
Speaker 2: 'The Thin Man.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I say, "I want to do 'The Thin Man.'" I said, "I want it to be banter, I want it to be funny.  I want it to be these two"--she says, "Okay."  So I go back, get with a friend of mine, and we start writing.  I write the treatment, and we write this thing based on 'The Thin Man,' and I'm a criminologist.  She works for the state department.  We research it.  I go to the state department.  I--we do all this research.  And we start shooting this pilot.  We shoot the pilot.  The pilot gets picked up, and now, we're doing thirteen episodes.  About the fourth--I, I was gonna do four episodes in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].  Then I was gonna go to Washington [D.C.] and shoot two or three in's and out's for two or more, two or more episodes.  So you get a sense that you're out and about in Washington.
Story_ID: 296845
Speaker 1: So I'm back [in the United States], and we're shooting this scene [for 'Snoops'].  And I need to--it's a scene where it requires me--Daphne [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid's character Micki Dennis] was in danger.  I had to run out, and we were trying to find this door to run out 'cause we had picked a house that was gonna be the exterior of our house.  We built the interior on the Hollywood back lot.  So (laughter) I picked this house.  I said, "I'm gonna run out of here.  I like this door."  And so I (unclear), and we go to shoot it.  And I go down, and say, "Well, let's break."  So I go break.  And one of the guys who worked on the crew, a big brother, big brother.  He was (laughter), he worked the (unclear).  He said, "Tim [HistoryMaker Tim Reid]."  I said, "Yeah."  He says, "Some little ole' white lady wants to see you, claims she knows you."  I said, "Who?"  He said, name is, I wanna call her name.  It sounds like Twiggy [ph.].  He said, "It's like, it's like Ziggy [ph.] or something."  I said, "Oh," I turn around.  And there's this old lady.  She's about five foot, if she's a five at all, four-nine.  She said, "Yes." Oh, I hadn't seen her for a year from Harbour Island [Bahamas].  And we hug each other.  And I say, "Man, how you doing?"  I says, "I'm shooting the show that we talked about on the beach."  She said, "Get out of here."  I said, "Yes, and where do you live?"  She says, "Right there."  I had picked her door (laughter) to run out of.  Isn't that amazing coincidence?  And, anyway, I don't know whatever happened to them.  We lost track of each other.  But that's how sometimes shows are created.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's incredible.  That's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But, you know, the thing--I was gonna say, the thing that, that kind of disappointing about that show, we, we did the pilot.  It aired.  And one of the worst reviews I ever got was a review out of Washington, D.C. from The Washington Post.  And the guy said, "I saw this show last night, 'Snoops,' and I'm insulted."  This was a white writer.  He said that this, that "Tim Reid would attempt in a time like this, when black people are suffering all over the United States, he would attempt to sell--to portray blacks in such upper-class life standards," (laughter).  I mean I was livid.  I was so angry with this guy.  We actually became friends after this, but I was just, I was so hurt that he didn't see, you know, 'The Thin Man.' He didn't see this sort of--nobody ever saw the--and we were doing some great--and it was well written.  We were going back and forth.  Nobody ever saw it, 'The Thin Man,' but it was 'The Thin Man.' If you go back--well, you'd have to be in Africa to see it, but they play it in Nigeria.  They play it in Ethiopia, played a few other places.  But it was 'The Thin Man,' and it was funny, it was fast-paced, and it would have been a lot of fun to do.
Story_ID: 296846
Speaker 1: We may have talked about this before, but you are, you seem to be a movie aficionado 'cause--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --several of your projects have been based on old movies you saw--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my [paternal] grandmother [Beulah Reid] made me that.  My grandmother and I were very close.  And when she took me when my mother [Augustine Wilkins] had given me up when I was nine.  She took me in.  I was a frail, frightened young man.  And she just embraced me with love, and gave me freedom and, and at night, around ten o'clock, back in the old days or eleven o'clock, there would be this last movie before the, the thing went off, would be some sort of movie from Hollywood, '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s], black and white movie.  And she loved 'em.  And so we'd sit up at night and watch, you know, George Raft, and all these characters come through and strut their ways.  And she would comment, as all black people do when they watch a movie.  She loved Brian Donlevy.  "Oh, here he come.  Hacho [ph.], baby."  (Laughter) So we'd sit and watch this movie, and I really got into movies.  I, I probably know as much about movies as I know about anything else.  Again, old movies, but that's how I found my love for movies, watching movies with my grandmother 'til eleven--twelve o'clock.  I was late for school every morning.  I lived right across the street from the school (laughter).  But I know a lot about movies.
Story_ID: 296847
Speaker 1: Now you did one of these ABC afternoon specials [ABC Afterschool Special] or something for, for kids around '89 [1989] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did a couple of ABC afternoon specials, movies.  We've done--been very blessed.  Once I, once I got--after 'Snoops,' I quit the business.  I bought a farm in Charlottesville [Virginia], and I sold my Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz], sold my house in California, bought a tractor and this farm, and I quit the business for about, I would say two years.  I didn't even have a TV in my house for a full year.  I would not allow a TV.  And I said, I have to regurgitate show business.  I gotta get it out of my system because it's trying to kill me or I'm killing myself trying to be involved in it.  And it's best that I, I cleanse myself, detox, from, from the whole concept of, of the way I've been living for the last twenty years.  So we got on the farm, and I drove my tractor around, moved gravel from one place to another.  My wife [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid] got into canning, and we had a few horses, and we did that for about two to three years.  And then one day my business manager called me, and said, "You like the farm?"  I said, "I love it.  It saved my life."  He said, "Well, if I were you, I'd get a job if you wanna keep it," (laughter).  And so I said, I'd better get back to work.  So we then decided that I wanted to do more producing and creating.
Story_ID: 296848
Speaker 1: So what did you do after you came out of your little sabbatical (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was fortunate enough to get some work in the film business.  I did a movie with John Frankenheimer and Don Johnson called 'Dead Bang.'  And we shot it up in Canada.  It was a great experience for me working with Frankenheimer and, and Don.  Don Johnson and I got along very well.  Don Johnson and Frankenheimer weren't getting along too well.  I became the intermediary between the two of them.  But I really enjoyed spending time with Frankenheimer, and I remember he had a screening for '[The] Manchurian Candidate.'  And we talked about that movie.  And he and I became very good friends.  You know, when he got back to California, we--our families would have dinner together.  We'd go out.  We--he was, he was a wonderful man, but extraordinary director--and interesting stories.  I learned a lot about the, the mental process of directing from him.  And anyway, he called me one day after the 'Dead Bang' had come out, he called me, said, "I got this film I'm doing up in Canada again.  I want you to come up and play this guy," and he named me the name.  I said, "That's a Polish name."  He said, "Yeah, don't worry about the name.  I'm not changing anything.  I'll change the name, but I'm not changing a line.  You're gonna play this Polish lieutenant colonel [Lieutenant Colonel Clark]."  I said, "Okay."  So I flew up to Canada, Calgary, and we spent the winter of the artic express that came through--it was one of the worst winters in the history of Canada, up in the, the tundra, up near Bath [Canada; Loyalist, Canada] shooting this movie out in sub-zero temperature for many weeks, myself, Jurgen Prochnow, Roy Scheider from 'Jaws.'  I said, Harry Dean [Stanton] and myself and a young lady from Berlin [Germany], I believe.  And we made this movie, and it was called 'The Fourth War' based on Einstein's [Albert Einstein] quote.  Someone asked Einstein, what did he think the World War III would be fought with.  He said, "World War III will be fought with nuclear weapons, but World War IV--or the fourth war will be fought with sticks and stones."  And so the movie was kind of based on that quote.  It was about two military fanatics, both on the Russian side and on the American side who one day, out of just pure machoism almost started the fourth war, and it ended up with two men fighting like cavemen out in the tundra with their military sides on both, gun-to-gun, waiting for them to start the war.  And, of course, it was neutralized.  Now, the problem with that is--it's a wonderful movie, wonderful movie.  I had a--I was a co-star in it, and great lines, and it was a wonderful movie.  (Laughter) The problem is, the week the movie was to open the Berlin Wall [Berlin, Germany] fell.  So (laughter) it neutralized any drama that this movie would have, with a confrontation between Russia [Soviet Union] and the United States.  Literally, the week the movie came out, the Berlin Wall fell.  So nobody went to see the movie.  It was pulled, and I haven't seen it even shown in--on cable.  But it was a very dramatic piece, and a study of what happens to men sometimes when they get involved in the fanaticism of war.  I thought that movie--when I, when I finished that movie, I said, this movie is going to take me into the film career that I want.  I just knew that I was like, ah, I couldn't have asked for a better opportunity to work with Roy Scheider, Jurgen Prochnow.  He'd just come off of 'Das Boot,' I mean it was--I had a great role, Harry Dean Stanton, ah, it was just wonderful.  Nada.  Didn't get a job, nothing, disappeared.  And there went my film career.
Speaker 1: Now, that's a bad break.  That's really a bad break (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  But, that's show biz.
Story_ID: 296849
Speaker 1: You appeared on an episode of 'Perry Mason,' too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played--we did a 'Perry Mason' movie--myself and Vanessa Williams.  We played husband and wife, and what was really interesting is that I had just, prior to--a year before that with 'Snoops,' or two years before with 'Snoops,' I hired a young lady who had just come to Hollywood.  And she--gave her one of her first jobs to play on this, on this part.  And it was Angela Bassett.  And I didn't see her again until we were doing this 'Perry Mason' movie, 'cause I think it was 'A Case of the Silence'--'Silent Singer' ['Perry Mason: The Case of the Silenced Singer'], or something like that.  And, of course, I was--the case was the fact that she was killed, Vanessa Williams [Terri Knight] and my character [Jack Barnett], and I was the suspect of murdering my wife.  And, and all these characters are in there, and, and she had just come off of a movie.  She kept saying, "Ah, man, this is movie, I'm so hopeful of this movie."  And it was the Tina Turner autobiographical movie ['What's Love Got to Do with It'].  And the rest is history.  So, but that was a--it was fun--we shot that in Denver [Colorado], and how can it be?  My wife was Vanessa Williams, got to kiss her and have a good time.  It was real wonderful (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm telling you. That sounds (unclear). And you were also in Stephen King's 'It,' which was a multi-night (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --night, made-for-TV.
Speaker 2: Yeah, made--mini-series.
Speaker 1: Mini-series, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, again, a wonderful cast, and I had the pleasure of, of being in this Stephen King novel ['It'], brought to film--I mean brought to television.
Speaker 1: So you played a librarian [Mike Hanlon], right, in this?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was actually the narrator of the story.  So not only was I in the film, I mean visually, but it was my voice that told the story.  So it was, it was real interesting 'cause you saw--it started as a young child growing up with this group of people into the adulthood.  And the kid [Marlon Taylor] who played me as a younger age, I've bumped into him over the years.  I think he was on 'Sister, Sister' once or twice, to see him now is--my age when I was playing the part (laughter).  But it was really a fun--we were all up in Vancouver [Canada].
Story_ID: 296850
Speaker 1: We're up in Vancouver [Canada], all of us for weeks upon weeks, shooting this, this movie ['It'], Tim Curry, who played the evil clown.  It's frightening.  And while I was up there--I love Vancouver.  I always thought about moving to Vancouver.  I went to this little coffee shop on the corner.  And I'd go in, and I met the guy, and, "Yeah, man, I'm trying to make this thing work."  "All right, all right, give me coffee."  And I hung out there before I would go to work or when I wasn't off.  And then I left. We did the mini-series, I leave.  A few years later, maybe a year later, I go back to do the 'Highlander.'  I played a reoccurring [Sergeant Bennett] in a series called the 'Highlander.'  A friend of mine was directing, and--
Speaker 2: Did you keep your head in the--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Did you keep your head in the 'Highlander'?
Speaker 1: I kept the head.  I was, I was a police officer that was sort of reoccurring.  I had like--I did about five or six of 'em.  And Ray Austin, Barron Austin, as a matter of fact, who had directed one of my 'Snoops' was actually directing.  He put me in it, so I go up, and I go to that coffee shop.  It's there, but across the street is another one, bigger.  So I go over to the guy.  I says, "Hey."  He said, "Man, I haven't seen you.  And you need to buy stock in my company."  I go, "Coffee?  Get out of here," (laughter), "buy no coffee stock."  He said, "Man, look, it's selling for like, I don't know, three dollars or four dollars a share on the Canadian stock exchange."  And he says, "And I think we're gonna go public in America."  I'm going, "Get out of here."  Well, of course, it was Starbucks (laughter).  And I never did buy 'cause I didn't think coffee would catch on in America.  (Laughter) Nobody would pay, at that time, $3, $2, $3 for a cup of coffee?  You gotta be kidding me.  Well, I probably could of bought the farm if I had listened to him.
Story_ID: 296851
Speaker 1: So 'It' was widely seen and--
Speaker 2: Around the world.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Very big in Japan.  I still get fan mail from there.  And, frankly, until, 'til the end, I, I have a issue with Stephen King, all of his endings.  He's an incredible writer.  He must write a--he never sleeps, just writes.  But it, at the end, the monster just--it didn't work.  The monster didn't work.  It's sort of a rubber guy coming out with things.  It didn't work, but up to that ending, one of the most frightening things you'll ever see in television.
Speaker 1: There's something about clowns that disturbs a lot of people.
Speaker 2: Oh, the clowns.  I was--what's really nice about that show was we all kind of interact, and we hung out together.  You had time because it was a mini-series, to sort of, kind of create the rapport during rehearsals of what these kids--'cause you know you gotta, you gotta put together a rapport that didn't exist with total actors and in many cases, strangers, although I had worked with quite a few of 'em.  But we're up there [Vancouver, Canada], and we would hang out together sometimes.  And one day we're rehearsing, and someone says, we gotta, we gotta decide what the clown looks like.  So, Tim Curry went in--'Rocky Horror Show' ['The Rocky Horror Picture Show'] and all these incredible things he'd done over his career.  He went back to put in makeup, put on a mask.  They spent hours and they bring him out, and we look at him.  We go, "Yeah, that's scary, that's scary, but it's a little too much."  It had like a werewolf thing and, just, did it three times.  And each time, about two hours or three hours each between, he'd come out, we'd go, eh (sigh).  So finally someone said, "How about less is more."  "What did they say?"  Said, "Less is more."  So they went back, and they took off everything and just put him in makeup, gave him some teeth and some interesting eye makeup and brought him out, scared the bejesus (laughter).  I'm going like, geez, I don't wanna see that.  And that was the, the, the look of the clown.  So sometimes you gotta go away from what you want to get it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was really effective (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's how it all came about.
Story_ID: 296852
Speaker 1: You were in an episode of 'Zorro' in '91 [1991].
Speaker 2: Yeah, again, my friend, Barron Austin [Ray Austin], called me and said, "You wanna go to Spain?"  I'm going, "Ah, yeah."  So I went over to Spain to shoot a few episodes, playing--for me, it was a childhood fantasy.  You know, as a little kid, you see 'Zorro'--I don't know if you remember as a kid, but they had 'Zorro.'  I mean imagine, I'm getting a chance at adult to go play (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Guy Williams played 'Zorro.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, Guy Williams.  Well, I get a call to go over and, and play this interesting sort of black character [Dr. Lorenzo Lozano] in about four episodes, three or four episodes in 'Zorro.'
Speaker 1: Say, listen, how do they work a black character into this 'cause, you know, and--it's not, I mean when you really think about history, it's not that impossible, but--
Speaker 2: Not only, not impossible.  It should have been there in history long before (laughter).  We should be in television before that.  Well, I just played this character, and based on many real characters who, in Spain.  I mean quite a few blacks in, in Spain at that time, all over Spain, Central America, South America, former slave colonies, free blacks now.  I mean quite a few.  So this was this kind of, free black kind of gambling, salesman, shyster who came through town and interacted and got in trouble with, with 'Zorro' and became his friend (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is Dr. Lorenzo Lozano.
Speaker 2: Lorenzo Lozano, yes (laughter).  And it was so much fun.  I mean really a lot of fun to play that.  So again, it was sort of this childhood fantasy, getting to play out our, our fantasies.
Speaker 1: And shot in Spain?
Speaker 2: Shot in Ma- in, in Spain, in Madrid, outside of Madrid.
Story_ID: 296853
Speaker 1: One of my favorite Spain stories (laughter) is, when I was doing 'KRP' ['WKRP in Cincinnati'] I got this call to go audition for a commercial.  It was a test commercial for a beer [Fall City Beer (ph.)].  And I go down, and they said, "All right, we need you and another guy."  And they got this guy Norton [ph.], who was a Broadway star.  I can't think of Norton's first name now.  But anyway, she and I got the part.  And we said, "Okay, what's the commercial?"  "It's for a new beer that's gonna be coming out of the Midwest.  We can't give you the name of it right now."  I said, "Okay.  When do we shoot?"  He says, "Well, we'll give you the date, but it'll be soon, and it'll be in London [England]."  I'm going, "London? Sure."  So in 1980, I get a, I get a ticket.  I fly to London.  I find out that the gentleman who directed 'Hard Days and Nights,' [sic. 'A Hard Day's Night'] Lester--
Speaker 2: Richard Lester.
Speaker 1: Richard Lester.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Very powerful, very flamboyant, very outspoken and volatile director, known for that, is directing this commercial, the first one he had ever--he had done with an American group.  We go over to London.  I get a car, a Bentley with a driver by the name of Reed [ph.], my driver.  He's assigned to me wherever I wanna go.  I'm staying in then The Churchill [Hyatt Regency London, London, England], and I mean I'm like boy, this is the way to go, to London (laughter), 1980.  You gotta be kidding me.  I'm, I'm in high cotton.  And so we go to work, and, and Lester would not--he would not, he didn't wanna work, going, ah, I don't like this.  This is--the scene's not working.  I still don't know what the--nobody, 'cause it's so secretive.  We get bits and pieces.  And so we have to shoot, and I find out we're playing astronauts, a black and white astronaut who have crash landed to this place that is bland, and we order bland--we order a beer that's so different from any other beer because the world is gray where land.  It's this sort of bland world.  It's, it's, you know, it's the plot for this beer.  So (laughter)--and they, and it's just a test.  It's not even--anything's that's gonna air because they haven't even--they gonna, trying to sell the beer, and they spent millions to shoot this commercial.  They think Lester can do it 'cause they want it to be avant-garde.  So they, they go to where they shot 'James Bond,' the first big set out in, out in, near Wilmington--Wimbledon [London, England] in the Wimbledon Studios out that way, and huge set. They build this sort of space bar, massive bar, you know, that--huge set where they shot 'Bond' on.  And we're there, two astronauts.  We're landing.  Lester looks and he says, "Well, I don't like this set.  We can't do this scene here."  He said, "All right, everybody go home.  I'll tell you where we're gonna shoot it in a day or two."
Story_ID: 296854
Speaker 1: So we go home.  I hang out with, with Willie Lester [sic. Richard Lester].  We go to the White Elephant bar [White Elephant, London, England].  I'm seeing Michael Caine, I'm hanging out--I mean everything is on everybody.  I got my own driver, the Bentley (laughter).  So finally, he calls me, calls and says, "We're all going to Spain.  We're going to Almeria, Spain," where they shot the spaghetti westerns, where Clint Eastwood shot '[A] Fistful of Dollars.'  It's this cowboy town.  He says, "That's what the world should look"--I mean, "that's what the earth should look like when you land."  So we go to Almeria, Spain.  We literally go where they shot 'Fistful of Dollars,' and all these spaghetti westerns in the town.  We go outside, and we shoot us crash landing in the desert, and we walk up, and we shoot the first scene.  And we stay in Spain for like, almost a week.  And I'd never been to Spain before.  Then we go back to London [England], and we spend another two weeks shooting us coming into the bar.  It was four weeks, on per diem with a Bentley (laughter), flying around with crazy Willie Lester, shooting this commercial that never saw the light of day.  They looked at it, and go, "Ah, we don't wanna do this beer," (laughter).  But if they had done it, I had a contract, woohoo, I'd have made millions.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know the young people watching this may not understand how much is spent on a commercial.
Speaker 1: Back then with Willie Lester, I think that was probably, back then, about a two and a half million dollar deal in the '80s [1980s], which equivalent today would be about eight to ten million dollars.
Speaker 2: So the production values and the time spent on a commercial that's gonna air for about, what?
Speaker 1: That would have been a thirty second spot, forty seconds, yeah, thirty second spot.  I think we did a minute because it was a presentation.  But they, they really wanted--I give the company a lot of credit.  They really wanted to try something different 'cause you--this was a ad agency, by the way, bidding with other beer companies for this beer.  And they won the contract, but the beer was never done.  It was never--it was called Fall City Beer [ph.], never came out.  And we had the contract this, with this--if the beer had come out, we'd have been the face of--and the whole theme would have gone for a while of these astronauts.  It's almost like the last scene in 'Planet of the Apes,' when you come back and you find out that it's America.  Well, imagine these guys going out--and I've seen it in several sci-fi movies since then, where they come back to the earth.  But the world has changed, and they're trying to carry on their lives.  That would have been the running theme.  I'd a made me a fortune (laughter).  But I had a great time, met Willie Lester before he passed, went to Almeria, Spain, stood at the bar where Clint Eastwood stood (laughter).
Story_ID: 296855
Speaker 1: Now, you did a, a reprise of your role as Venus Flytrap [Gordon Sims] in 1992, was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did a, they did a 'KRP' ['WKRP in Cincinnati']--what it was?  Second generation.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'The New WKRP [in Cincinnati'] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'The New WKRP,' and I went back to reprise Venus Flytrap.  My friend, Bill Dial, was the producer.  And Howard [Hesseman] was on the show, and who else was on the show.  Richard [Sanders], I think was on the show.  They had a few of the people.  And then they had a new, new, new Loni [Anderson], a new this, a new that.  And, it was a fun, fun week, you know, fun week, kind of sad-funny 'cause, you know, you can't go back.  But it was fun to work with some of those people again.  You can't recapture lightening once it's out of the bottle, that's for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us about 'Mastergate.'  This is in '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Mastergate' was a wonderful opportunity to, to do one of the first sort of satirical look at news.  I'm trying to think who, who wrote that.  All of a sudden the name just--oh, Larry Gelbart.  What am I talking?  I got a call to come in and meet him, and he had been a fan of 'Frank's Place' and wanted to meet me.  I met him.  He say, "I got just the part for you."  He said, "I want you to be the newscaster," the on-camera guy, again, sort of the narrator for this, this incredible look at the [U.S.] Senate, behind the scenes, sort of strange, satirical look, sort of a modern-day 'Strange Fellow'--'Dr. Strangelove' ['Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'], only in politics.  And I did that.  And it was a lot of fun working with him.  The words were incredible, and it was a good piece, it was a good piece.  And I played the newscaster that came in and out.  But just working with him was, was a joy, working for him, I should say.
Speaker 1: Okay, you mentioned 'Highlander' before.  So you were on three episodes of that series, right?
Speaker 2: Actually, about--more, almost six, but, yeah, about six episodes.  I went, we went up there occasionally, quite a few times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Occasionally, quite a few times?  (Laughter) Don't tell anybody I screwed that up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, '93 [1993], there was something called 'Say a Little Prayer.'
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Oh, wait a minute.  'Say a Little Prayer.'  That, yes, that was a movie of the, that was a ABC--no, a kid's, kid's show.  No, that was 'Make a Wish' [sic. 'You Wish!']. I don't know which one it was.  We--I've, I've done about three or four of those sort of movies, small TV movies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's like--
Speaker 2: --shot a couple of 'em down in, in Australia.
Speaker 1: Those are afternoon specials (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, afternoon specials, and then one for the, what's the--Nickelodeon channel.  We shot one in New Zealand, nice opportunities.  You work, you go down, you, you know, you see the world.  No complaints about it.
Speaker 1: Why were they shooting these in New Zealand?
Speaker 2: They got incredible rebates.  I mean, you know, you make a deal, and the country gives you money.  You come down and you save, you know, it covers your production costs.  I mean, when I say part of your, your production fees.  Get as much as two, $300,000 to shoot a couple million dollar movie down there.  I don't know if that's still go--well, I'm sure it still goes on.
Story_ID: 296856
Speaker 1: Ninety-four [1994] is the year that you started working on 'Sister, Sister,' right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: With the Mowry twins [Tia Mowry-Hardrict and Tamera Mowry-Housley] and--
Speaker 2: With the Mowry twins.  When I first saw 'em, they had just turned thirteen.  And now they're mothers.  It's--they were two of the most honestly, naturally, loving young ladies I've met.  I mean they really are wonderful people, very talented.  The voices--can sing and dance and they're really, really nice young ladies.  I gave 'em a hard time, by the way (laughter).  I really gave 'em a hard time.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I said, you know, "You guys are too clean.  You go to church three or four times a week.  You need to see a little, just a little devilishness around you," (laughter).  I think the first time they ever heard the, the F word was out of my lips, the first time (laughter).  I mean they just--I would shock them, not purposely.  I just, I am who I am, and I--and Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] and I would get into sometimes very heated debates.  And I (laughter), they would--sometimes I'd say, "Put your hand over your ears.  Jackee and I are going at it," you know.  But it's funny, I've seen them a few times since they've become adults, and they often, they sit down and laugh.  And they hear what they thought of me, and what was going on, and Jackee at that time was really nice.  But in a strange way, we had an impact on each other.  I mean I, I have--I was getting a little, what's the word?  Negative about young people at that time.  I was like, you know, you get older and you get like, ah, these young kids coming in the business.  Yeah, these--they don't, they--entitled and all that.  And they kind of made me realize a little something about young people, you know.  Not all, you know, it's not all, but not only that, you know, it's their time.  I mean don't, don't get bitter because time is moving.  Change.  And they really--they sort of reintroduced me to, to the nobility of, of youth.  And I think I introduced them to a side of life that (laughter) they must have needed (laughter).  But we had a wonderful six years.  It was sometimes difficult for me.  I was torn between building a studio back here [Petersburg, Virginia] at the time.  I wasn't crazy about a couple of the producers we had.  We used to get into conflict, but the show--I never watched the show, by the way.  I, I don't think I watched or have watched--six years, I don't think I've watched maybe five or six episodes in the whole time.  And recently, I, I catch myself, you know, something will go by.  I stop and look at it.  But I saw one of the episodes not too long ago, and I have to say, I was, I was delightfully surprised on how it held up.  And it made me laugh, and it made me think I wish I had been more there.  I don't mean as a performer, but I mean as realizing where I was, and who I was working with.  They were very talented people, good writers.  Now don't let--don't ever tell them I said that, but they were, they were very good writers.
Story_ID: 296857
Speaker 1: And what made me realize it was, I was at an awards show in Dallas [Texas], and we were giving an award to a good friend of mine, Richard Roundtree, and he had been in a film of mine.  And they wanted me to come and give him the award.  And I did.  When it was over, a young lady walked up to me.  She said, "Mr. Reid [HistoryMaker Tim Reid], may I speak with you?"  And I thought she wanted an autograph.  She said, "No, I'd like to speak with you."  I said, "Okay."  She says, "I wanna thank you."  And I said, "For what?"  She said, "For raising me."  I said, "Excuse me?"  She said, "Mr. Reid," she says, "I was in foster homes most of my life," she says, "from the age of six when I lost my parents, and I went into foster homes.  And I don't know if"--she said, "I don't know if you know about the foster system, but for black kids in particular, it can be very difficult if you don't get a loving--and they're few and far between--loving heads of these kinds of things at that time."  She says, "And so it was very difficult for me, and oftentimes, I was moved to, one to another often," she said, "so I didn't get the guidance, and I start watching 'Sister, Sister.'"  And she says, "For six years of my life, I saw"--she said, "When I start watching, I said, from now, he's [Ray Campbell] my father.  Whatever he tells Tamera [Campbell], I'm gonna act on.  He's talking to me."  She said, "I want you to know you raised me.  What you said, the information you gave to her," and she said, "I want you to know that I'm now getting ready to graduate from college, and I'm an artist"--she sent me some of her artwork.  And it really hit me.  I'm going, the power of this medium that I'm in.  I mean it, it, it was, you know, it was touching, but also a bit unnerving, you know, to think that what we say and what we do and how these characters perform have such an impact on young minds.  But this young lady, delightfully so, was a positive story, but--and I understood.  The way she said it, not only did I believe it, I could understand it, the way she said it.  She said, "You raised me."  She said, "I had no--no one, no male figure in my life but you.  And I would listen to it."  She said, "I've seen every episode many times."  She says, and she said, "I often look at 'em now when I, when I get to thinking about who I was and what I was," say, "I go back and in those episodes, I can look at that episode and tell where I was and what I was about to do."  That's a, that's incredible impact of the, the medium that we're in.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I remember that show very well.  I saw it a lot because my daughter who was about six, you know, watched it every--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --every Sunday night.  It was on Sunday nights.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And she'd you play the father to the Mowry twins [Tia Mowry and Tamera Mowry], and then we'd watch 'Deep Space Nine' ['Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'] with Avery Brooks--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --father to his son, and (unclear) the father.  But, I mean you played the role of a--you often played a role of a good man.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I didn't like the writing on that show as much.  I really didn't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I didn't either at the time I was doing it--
Speaker 2: And I thought of--as a--I'd say, why is Tim Reid doing this?  This is a man that was in 'Frank's Place.'  Why is he doing this?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: But the--
Speaker 1: I did it for the money (laughter), and Suzanne de Passe asked me to do it, and she and I had had some words many times before.  And I didn't wanna have--I didn't wanna get her, her angry at me again (laughter).
Story_ID: 296858
Speaker 1: But you did play a decent character [Ray Campbell on 'Sister, Sister'], and you often are cast in roles as a professorial type guy--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --librarian, you know, which is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --which is interesting.  You said that you would curse on the set in front of the kids (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, man, we would--I would just, you know, I, I saw them--I, you know, I was there when she got--one of 'em [Tia Mowry-Hardrict and Tamera Mowry-Housley] got their first kiss.  So I was, I knew when they, when they had their first menstrual cycle.  I mean they would tell me things, you know, or I would--we would talk about it, and I would give my, my point of view, having been a father of a daughter [Tori Reid] who was older and sons [Timothy Reid II and Christopher Tubbs].  So I mean I wasn't, it wasn't, you know, I wasn't rude or abrupt, but I was, I think I was honest to them in a way that was a bit raw, but also I think they needed--I felt that they needed to know.  I remember one time (laughter), they were talking.  We were sitting back, you know, all the time between sets, they were saying, they were saying, "You know, when we get out of here"--this was near the end of the show--, "we're gonna go to New York [New York] soon as we graduate from"--one of 'em was going to Pepperdine [University, Malibu, California].  "We gonna graduate from college.  We're going to New York."  I said, "You're gon' do what?"  Said, "Yeah, we're going to New York."  And I said, "To do what in New York?"  "We gon' live."  I said, "You can't live in"--I said, "I'll tell you what.  Six months in New York, you'll be drinking, you'll be drinking sewer water."  I said, "Somebody will have you out there drinking sewer"--she said, "Oh, get out of--you always coming up with that."  I said, "You ain't ready for New York."  So anyway, flash forward, years later, I'm in Canada--Toronto, shooting a picture.  And they're there.  And I come down in the hotel, and I see her.  "Ohhh."  She said, "We gotta take you to dinner, we gotta take you to dinner."  I say, "All right."  So I go to dinner with them, and they said, "We got to tell you this."  I said, "What?"  Said, "Well, about a year ago, we were in New York, and, you know, and we were staying there, and everything.  And somebody said, 'Come go to this party,' and we went, 'All right, let's go.'  And we didn't know anybody there."  She said, "We get to this party, and it was bit, kind of out there."  This was their first real, on-the-edge party.  I mean drugs and everything (laughter).  Said, somebody came up to them, and offered them something, and said, they were debating, "And then all of a sudden, we both heard you say, 'You'll be drinking sewer water,'" (laughter).  She said, "We jumped in a cab, (laughter) and went home."  And I cracked up laughing.  I said, "See, what did I tell you?  You listened to me."  She said, "Yeah, we listened to you.  We came back home."
Story_ID: 296859
Speaker 1: Well you play a father [Ray Campbell on 'Sister, Sister'] well on the air, and seem like, off the air, you were doing, you know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ah, I had, you know, I've been very blessed.  My, my kids and I, we went through the difficulties of my, of my first marriage [to Rita Reid] not working and, and watching them, but I stayed connected.  And we've had a very interesting roller coaster life.  But I cherish the fact that--not only do I love them as my children, and they love me as, as, hopefully, as their--not hopefully, I know they love me as their father.  But we have a really good relationship.  I mean I like them as people.  And they have now become sort of my confidants, you know.  So it's a good--it's, it's not--and I had 'em very young.  So, you know, my oldest [Timothy Reid II] is forty-six years old, and, you know, (laughter) so it's--he just called me, he just had a birthday recently.  He called me.  He said, "Dad," he said, "I had an epiphany."  He said, "I was thinking about you on my birthday."  I say, "What happened?"  He says, "You're right.  There is no difference."  I said, "I told you," (laughter) 'cause he said, what shocked him was, he was sitting there, and he realized that he was four years away from being fifty, and he remembered so vividly my fiftieth birthday.  I had a hell of a fiftieth birthday party and, I mean it's one of the most talked-about parties of all times in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and it was just recently in his mind and in mine too.  He says, "I'm four years away from my fiftieth, dad."  He said, "You're right."  I mean he was so shocked (laughter), and interesting, and I just laughed and enjoyed the conversation so much.

Speaker 1: 'Sister, Sister' brought me a, a new audience, you know.  I've been very blessed with--with longevity, you know, over forty years in this business.  And 'Sister, Sister' now has given me a youthful--people, young kids today, twenty years old and younger, don't know me from 'KRP' ['WKRP in Cincinnati'].  They've never seen 'KRP.'  The Mowry twins [Tia Mowry-Hardrict and Tamera Mowry-Housley] had never seen 'WKRP in Cincinnati.'  I don't think 'til this day they've ever seen it.  So because of, sort of the staggered career I've had, I would rather have one show for twenty years.  But nonetheless, I'll take this mixed-up group.  I now have this sort of twenty-something, thirty-something year old group that know me from 'Sister, Sister.'  So I have bridged almost three generations with various shows.  And that's, that's something that I cherish.  I mean it's kinda unique to have that kind of longevity in television, you know, not in feature films, but in television.
Story_ID: 293826
Speaker 1: Another thing you did in '94 [1994] was 'Race for Freedom: The Underground Railroad'--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) --you played Frederick Douglass.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a, you know, a revered black figure, who's been played before by Arthur Burghardt, I think, and by--
Speaker 2: Avery.
Speaker 1: William--yeah, Avery Brooks (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And William Marx.
Speaker 1: William Marx, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I got to--the reason why I got to play Frederick Douglass in 'Race to Freedom' is 'cause I produced the movie (laughter), so I knew who to cast for that: myself.  That was a, again, another thing that just kind of came about.  I, I put together the, produced the production 'Race to Freedom' on a trip to the South of France at MIPCOM.  And I was there, and I was pitching this show.  And I was pitching it to Family Channel, and a guy there, Terry Botwick, I think his name was, who was then representing Family Channel, and I met at a cafe outside of a hotel near MIPCOM in Cannes [France].  And he said, "I'd like to do this, but I need a partner."  And it was a young man there who was also pitching.  His name, Peter Suskin [ph.], from Atlantis [Alliance Atlantis Communications Inc.], out of Canada.  He says, "This guy pitched me something about the Underground Railroad, and you pitched me something.  I'm not gonna do two movies.  Why don't you guys come together?"  So we came together and made a deal that we would produce together and blend our, our stories, mine about a young couple, refugees, former, former slaves who escaped in Virginia and made it to Buxton [Canada].  And his was sort of a Romeo and Juliet.  So we blended two stories, and we, we agreed to shoot--I wanted to shoot it in Virginia but Canada won out because they gave a lot of money, and they had, of course, the community of Buxton as a, sort of a tourist area, was there.  So we made the film, and I decided to play Frederick Douglass.  It was a very important film for me.  You know, people are talking about 'Django' ['Django Unchained'] and that they had never seen this kind of team that--black and white team--in that movie.  Well, we did that in 'Race to Freedom' back then.  I wanted Glynn Turman to play a black slave catcher.  And he teamed up with this white character, which is based on, actually, two real characters, and would chase this couple all the way to Canada and not give up.  It was a point of pride.  It was also during the time of the Fugitive Slave Act [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850; Fugitive Slave Law] where it was, it was--they really wanted to bring 'em back 'cause they were afraid that the rest of the four million slaves would get wind of this and everybody would run away.  And the economy would crash, as it eventually did anyway.
Story_ID: 293827
Speaker 1: We had a lot of difficulty with that piece ['Race to Freedom: The Underground Railroad'], 'cause I, I didn't wanna call 'em slaves, you know.  I, I said, first of all, there were really no slaves.  There were enslaved people, but when they ran away, they were refugees.  And no one had ever used the term refugees in relationship to run-aways.  So I start calling 'em--and we had to go--I mean there was a big argument about that.  But if you ever watch 'Race to Freedom,' you hear them discussed as refugees.  And I also said, I--'Roots' had been, of course, the, the model for all slave movies.  And I said, I'm gonna do something else different.  I don't want the word nigger used anywhere in the script.  So they, "What do you mean?"  I said, "Take it out anywhere."  I said, I said, "you can use Negro," because I'm from the South, and I've certainly as a young person heard that.  "But I don't want the word nigger used."  Said--"Well, I mean I saw 'Roots.'"  I said, "I don't care if you saw 'Roots.'  I don't want it in the picture."  So I won that battle, and it was difficult, but the pur--the point I was trying to make was, one of the things that--infuriated me about 'Roots' was that there was a scene in the slave quarters where the wife and the husband, two black enslaved people were talking, and they were using the word among themselves in the slave cabin.  And I said, you know, I don't think that that's accurate, back then.  Maybe now, but back then, there no way in the world that slaves would have referred to one another as niggers because the word had such an offense and such pain.  There's no way.  I know my ancestors.  I don't see it, not among themselves.  I'm not saying white people didn't use it.  I'm saying--so I said, because of that, I don't want it used in this pictures.  We don't need it.  They're refugees.  I wanna set a whole different propaganda.  I want a different psychology.  I say, now, the end of the picture, we did a rewrite (laughter), I said, "I want the white guy, when he finally catch 'em," I said, "I want the black slave guy to kill him."  And, boy, (laughter) there was a big debate on that (laughter).  But anyway, I won out.  And the end of the picture when they catch these guys, he's gonna bring 'em back at all cost--matter of fact, gon' bring him back dead, the white slave catcher takes the gun and points it at the camera.  And you hear, pow.  And all of a sudden he turns around, and there's Glynn Turman [Solomon] and he falls to the ground.  And Glenn said, "You know, I really had had enough of him."  And he gets on the horse and he rides off into the sunset.  And I purposely wanted into the sunset like I had seen westerns and Randolph Scott (laughter) and John Wayne do (laughter).  And I--and that's how the movie ended.  And we premiered it in, in Washington [D.C.] at the Canadian Embassy [Embassy of Canada] with a room full of critics and newspaper people.  And when the movie was over--I did it for a Q&A, got standing ovation and it was over (laughter).  Courtney [B.] Vance played one of the kids, and it was a wonderful movie (laughter).  And so I asked, "All right, any questions then?"  They said, "Yes."  And so we did the nice, nice thing.  "Why did you decide--" I said, "It's based on a real character, the slave guy really existed.  There were some black men who teamed up with whites because they could, they could go undercover, so to speak, and do things that others couldn't do.  And it's based on the real character I've read about in history here in Virginia."  And he says, "Oh."  I said, "But let me ask you guys one thing."  I said, "Did anyone in this room miss the term nigger?"  And they all stopped, and went, "We never paid any attention.  We never realized it wasn't there."  I said, "That's the power of propaganda."  And so if you ever watch that movie, you'll notice two things.  They're referred to as refugees once they leave the plantation, and the word nigger is never used in the movies, all about slavery.
Speaker 2: And it was shot up in Buxton [Canada]?
Speaker 1: Shot up in, in Canada.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Buxton, yeah, we shot on the actual location.  And it was based on actually a true story.
Story_ID: 293828
Speaker 1: I was doing a whole series called 'The Runaways' that I never got off the ground, but I shot, I wrote like three treatments.  One of 'em, of course, was Henry Box Brown--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who was actually in the Virginia area.  If I'm not mistaken, the interesting thing about Henry Box Brown, I mean of many interesting things, let alone the man nailed--him being nailed in a box and being shipped like mail to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and surviving and the abolitionist who got him out.  But the man who nailed him in the box was the first casualty of the Fugitive Slave Act [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850; Fugitive Slave Law], first person to be hung, I believe, was a white man of the--'cause he nailed him in the box, and they traced it back to him.  Then I did a story on the Crafts out of Charleston [South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yeah, William [Craft] and Ellen Craft (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, incredible story.  They went all the way to London [England].  They were being chased by slave catchers.  Descendants of their family rebuilt Charleston after the, after the hurricane.  And I met those.  They had a big hundred-year anniversary celebration down there, something like that.  So there were these incredible stories that I wanna do called 'The Runaways' and this was one of them.  And I could never get the series done, so I ended up putting it into a movie[AW1].  And then we partnered with Atlantis [Alliance Atlantis Communications Inc.], and we made the movie.  And it was nominated that year for an ACE--CableACE Award up against $8 million pictures.  We did ours for a million two [$1.2 million].  And it was nominated as one of the best pictures of that year.  And it also to this re--to this day, holds the record for an audience.  It was simulcast the same night on Family Channel and BET [Black Entertainment Television] to over a hundred million audiences, I mean the audience size.  I don't know how many of those people watching, but it was one of the largest, if not the largest cable--I was trying to get--it as funny.  The idea was to set a Guinness record [Guinness World Record].  If I had gotten Canada, C--CBC in Canada to air it the same time, it would have been aired in Canada, Family Channel and BET simultaneously.  And it would have been the largest in the history.  But they got angry, and they says, "No, we won't do it the same time."  So they waited a week (laughter).  But it was a very successful film.
Story_ID: 293829
Speaker 1: Now, when you do a historical piece like this, do you, for instance, the whole idea of the Underground Railroad--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --do you consult with Underground Railroad experts or do you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I research, you know, I mean that's--again, one of the nice things about living in Virginia and on the South--in the South and East Coast, you know, there's history here.  I mean, you know, a house I live in was built in 1853 by slaves.  So it, it--there's a lot of history.  Research here is, is an industry.  I mean there're people who spend their time--that's all they do.  So I research extensively, and I read a great deal about stuff like that, and it was also part of my, my, you know--it wasn't in our school books.  But it was in our church.  It was in our community, and we had some incredible teachers back then.  One of the pitfalls of integration--only a few I could, would even consider as pitfalls, but one of 'em is that in integration when, when the schools sort of flew open, they did what they always do, they closed down quite a few black schools, of course, to save money.  And in doing so, they displaced a lot of teachers because they couldn't get the job in the white school 'cause there were only so many places.  And therefore, a lot of these incredible teachers retired.  But when they were there, they were there.  I mean there was no fear of students.  There was no loss of control.  These teachers back when I was in school were serious.  And they exposed you to a lot of things and history.
Story_ID: 293830
Speaker 1: So you're pretty busy during the '90s [1990s].  You're doing 'Sister, Sister,' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm busy as I don't know what.
Speaker 1: --you do this 'Underground Railroad' ['Road to Freedom: The Underground Railroad'].
Speaker 2: Building a studio [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia].  I'm, I'm on it (laughter), traveling the world--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so did you start building the studio?
Speaker 2: I started building the studio in '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, but you were in a reprisal of your role as "Downtown" Brown [Lt. Marcel "Downtown" Brown] in another 'Simon & Simon'--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we, we, yeah, we did--we were, we were very busy, and then after a brief period, the first three, I, I retired from '89 [1989] 'til '90 [1990], '91 [1991], I think.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then I started my company, United Image Entertainment [United Image Entertainment Enterprises], and we produced about seven films.  'Race to Freedom' was one, 'When We Were Colored' ['Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored'], 'Out-of-Sync' with LL Cool J starring in it.  What else did we do?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We did a thing called 'Spirit Lost.'
Speaker 1: Now, LL Cool J is a very hot commodity in those days.  So--
Speaker 2: Gave him his first starring role.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was very good.  I, I like LL.  He's, he's a good guy.
Speaker 1: LL Cool J, you were on 'Touched by an Angel,' too, with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was on with my good friend and, and life-long friend, Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett], who is responsible for me, when I first came to Hollywood, she, she gave me a view of Hollywood that sort of settled me down.  And I got a serious look at what this town--you know, what the town had to offer, and also how to handle it.  She taught me also what it meant to be in the game at the, at the professional level.  I learned a lot from her.
Story_ID: 293831
Speaker 1: Tell us about like 'Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored.'  Now, this is--I saw it at a film festival in Chicago [Illinois], Black Harvest Film Festival and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in a theater.  But, essentially, it's--a lot of people like this movie a lot.  They liked the book ['Once Upon a Time When We Were Colored,' Clifton Taulbert].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They liked the movie, but the distribution has not been great.
Speaker 2: It was--I was sitting at the farm [Charlottesville, Virginia], and I got--that I was taking--I used to take The New York Times down there, have it delivered to the farm.  And I was reading the Parade magazine, I think it was.  Or it was either a local paper or New York Times, and they had this story about this book called 'Once Upon a Time When We Were Colored.'  It was the center story, and I read the excerpt, and I said, that's my story.  I know that story.  I know what this man is writing about.  I lived that.  I, I was, I lived in colored town.  I know this.  I've gotta do this movie.  I can do it as well or better than anyone else.  And so I began the pursuit to get him [Clifton Taulbert], tracked him down, convinced him after months that he should give me the rights to it.  He had been offered from Warner Bros. [Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.] and all the other.  And he saw 'Frank's Place,' was a fan of 'Frank's Place.'  He said, "You could do this."  So I took it, and got a--a guy came in with a script, said, "I love this book.  I understand you have the rights.  You don't have to take this.  But read it.  If you like it, you can make a deal."  I read it.  I liked it, said, "I'm gonna do your script."  And then for, believe it or not, years, about three years, I went everywhere to try to sell this book--I mean to sell this script.  Why this movie is important.  But you gotta remember at that time, they were discovering urban America, they were discovering the transition from the '80s [1980s] to the '90s [1990s] and what was happening with black America and all was going on, that they wanted this hard-edged urban world, you know, the crack cocaine was coming into prominence, the urban--the landscape of urban America in terms of black was shifting in a very aggressive way.  It was the beginning of hip-hop and rap--well, rap anyway.  The message, I mean all these things.  And then right after that, 'Boyz n the Hood,' you know, 'Menace II Society,' this whole kind of urban aggressive thing that developed into gangster rap and all that, was at its birth.  So here I come with this warm and fuzzy tale about 'Once Upon a Time When We Were Colored.'  And nobody, black or white, wanted to hear about it.  "Nah, nah, come on, now, we don't wanna hear about that Uncle Tom stuff."  I'm going, "No, this is not about that.  This is a different story."  "No, no, no, we've seen that.  We saw it in 'Color Purple' ['The Color Purple']."  I'm going, "No, no, no, no."  Nobody would touch it.
Story_ID: 293832
Speaker 1: So finally I convinced Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson], I said, "Bob, you're from Mississippi, man.  This is our story."  He said, "Let me talk to some people."  So he talked to Wayne Huizenga, who at that time had just bought this company called Blockbuster [Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc.; Blockbuster LLC].  And he and Wayne made a deal.  Wayne said, "I'll go with you half and half."  So they, they raised--I wanted $4 million.  (Laughter) But Bob wouldn't put up all that, so he says, "Ah, all we got is $2.5 [million]."  I said, "2.5? This is an epic, man.  I gotta cover from 1940-something all the way--cars, trucks," and he said, "2.5."  "All right, I'll take it."  So I took the 2.5, went down and found some cotton and sent off the script to my friends and actors.  I didn't even cast it the normal way.  I would send the script.  I sent to the script to Phylicia Rashad, and I said, "Phylicia, read the script".  She read the script. She says, "Don't call my agent.  He won't let me do this.  He won't want me to do this," she said.  She said, "Don't even negotiate with him because I know you don't have the money."  She says, "You and I direct.  And I'll just tell them we're doing it."  I said, "Okay."  I sent the script to Richard Roundtree.  I sent the script to people, and I says, "You pick the part."  And everybody came in.  They just came in, and I cast some of the parts, and they just came in.  I said, "I don't have a lot, or any case.  I ain't got a lot of lines."  "I don't care.  I wanna be in this movie."  One of the touching and powerful stories for me was Taj Mahal.  I wanted this sound.  I said, "This has gotta be, Taj has gotta--where is Taj?"  So I chased, traced down Taj.  I get somebody to trace him down, and he performing somewhere.  I said, "Taj, [HistoryMaker] Tim Reid."  "Oh, I remember you, man, you--that show, 'Frank's Place.'"  "Yeah," I said, "I'm doing this movie.  I'm sending you the script."  I sent it, he said, "Tim, ain't nothing in there."  I said, "Don't worry, Taj.  I just want you to read it.  I will write you a part, but you gotta be in this movie."  He said, "All right."  So I get Taj.  [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes, I mean, all my friends.  Everybody wants to be in this picture.  Al Freeman [Jr.], everybody said, "Man, Al is tough.  You don't wanna deal with Al."  I said, "No, man, I want Al Freeman."  I saw what he did in, in 'Malcolm X.' This guy is serious," (laughter).  And I remember him from way back in movies, you know, back.  And I say, I've always wanted to work with him.  So I sent it to Al.  He called me, says, "You know, you ain't got no money."  I said, "No."  He said, "All right, all right, but I'm a do it"--I said, "You do it your way."  "All right."  He comes.  So we all get there.  My first time directing, first time DP [director of photography], a lot of first timers, got no money, but we got a lot of eager people.
Story_ID: 293833
Speaker 1: The day before we had to go to shoot ['Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored']--all right, I wanna tell you another story.  But the day before we go to shoot, I get this call from Taj Mahal.  He said, "Tim [HistoryMaker Tim Reid]."  I said, "Hi, Taj, how you doing?"  He says, "Look, man," he said, "My mama just died."  I said, "Oh, Taj, man, I'm sorry."  He said, "Yeah."  I said, "Look, Taj, I know you're supposed to come, but don't worry about it, man."  He said, "No, no, Tim."  He says, "I'm a--I bury her tomorrow, but I'll be on the plane right after the funeral.  My mama would want me in this movie."  So Taj buried his mother, got on the plane, was there the next day.  I hadn't even written anything for him.  I said, "Taj, I just want you here, and I--don't worry, I'll write you in scenes."  And I wrote him in scenes, and I wrote him in a scene in the church.  And then Taj, he was through.  He said, "I'm not leaving.  I'm not leaving till this picture is done."  I said, "What you gon' do?"  He said, "I'm going to play.  That's what I'm here for."  Taj would play, so much that I had to stop him sometimes 'cause I couldn't get the extras to come on set (laughter).  And he'd go back to the hotel and they would hold concerts out in the hotel garden.  And Taj would perform every night for the citizens, for everybody.  And he kept the, the flow--I mean this whole movie had a--I don't know what it was.  It had a feel about it, to people and to me.  And it was, it was something, again, that I'll never forget.  But one of the, one of the most--I mean it was so many emotional things in this movie.  One of the things was, the last frame of the movie, when the train is going North, when he says, "I'm leaving," the last train North, I put the real author [Clifton Taulbert] in the field.  So the last person you see in the movie is Clifton Taulbert.  Also with him was his daughter [Anne Kathryn Taulbert] and his son [Marshall Taulbert].  She died after seeing the movie.  And I remember him calling me, he said, "Man," he said, "you have no idea what that movie meant to me."  He said that--"She knows who she is from.  She knew.  She died knowing her ancestry and all that."  It was, that movie had a, a tremendous impact on a lot of people.
Story_ID: 293834
Speaker 1: And they [the cast of 'Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored'] worked, I mean, whew, man we had--we had two people almost die.  Matter of fact, we had one person die, and we brought him back.  And we had another one, (laughter) my, my wonderful Winnie [D. Brown], wardrobe, who I had worked with many times, she came (laughter), she heard that I was coming over to the studio to look at some of the sets for the next day's shooting.  And she said, "What is he doing there?"  She (laughter) gets, it's on a Sunday.  She shows up, said, "What are you doing?"  I said, "I just wanna see the costume."  "It's gonna be all right."  I said, "I know that, I just wanna see the costume."  So I leave.  She has her aorta burst that evening.  I went, I get, (unclear) get a call that night saying she's in the hospital; said, "What do you mean, hospital?"  "Her aorta burst--aorta burst."  "Aorta burst?  That's death."  "I know, she's in the operating room."  I said, "Oh, my God."  So I said--I rushed--we rush over to the emergency room.  My wife [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid] said, I said, "What, what's going on now?  Who's the surgeon?  Gonna do what?  Gonna operate on her?"  Well, you see, one thing I learned, again, from [John] Frankenheimer, from these other great directors I had the pleasure of working with, a director, in film in particular, is the leader of the pack.  He's the alpha male.  He's in charge of the story and the people.  I was taught that as a director, when you go into a town to shoot a movie, you introduce yourself to the police.  You introduce yourself to the people in that community because nine times out of ten, with a hundred or so people, somebody is going to get in a situation (laughter), and they all come to you first.  So I had this sort of fatherly thing about being a director--I still have it, that I'm in charge.  So I said, "Wait a minute.  She, you're just not gonna--who's gonna operate on her?  Let me see his credentials.  Has he operated--has he done open-heart surgery before?"  I said, "Hold on a minute."  So I get on the phone, and I call a friend of mine, happened to be the world's foremost trauma surgeon.  Matter of fact, whenever the president is in his area, he's on call.  His name is L.D. Britt, an incredible doctor.  I called L.D. (laughter), I said, "L.D., I got somebody down here who's working for me, who is about ready to go into heart surgery, and I just want you to know, I just want you to check on this doctor.  I'm not ready to okay this," 'cause her husband was on a flight.  He couldn't get here, and nobody was there.  I'm the one that's gotta say, yea or nay.  And if not, she's gonna die.  So (laughter), he calls the surgeon.  The doctor comes out.  He says, "Mr. Reid [HistoryMaker Tim Reid], you didn't have to call Mr. Britt," (laughter).  He says, "We're good.  We gon' look out for her.  We know what we're doing," (laughter).  So all right.  So anyway, they went in and operated on her, and she had in eight hours, I think three open-heart surgeries to save her life.  And she did, she's alive today.
Story_ID: 293835
Speaker 1: And that next morning, I mean I got no money.  I got like 250 [thousand dollars].  I only have twenty-four days to shoot this movie ['Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored'], which should have taken six weeks.  If I stop a day, the movie doesn't get done.  So I have to shoot the next day.  And everybody was--we're shooting the church scene in the movie, the scene where they have the church scene, and they decide they're gonna go and fight the Civil Rights Movement in Baltimore [Maryland].  I think Taj Mahal makes a statement.  He's going up to Baltimore for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] meeting from down in Mississippi.  And there's this big argument about should we be a part of the Civil Rights Movement?  Should, should Mississippi stay out of this.  White people ain't bothering them, and we don't bother them, you know, said, it was, it was the kind of thing that I remember from the Civil Rights Movement.  It wasn't all, everybody's in this thing.  There were some black people, including my father [William Reid], who didn't want me involved, kept saying, "Stay out of this.  You can get hurt."  So, protective, not Tom-ish, but protective.  So (laughter) we got this scene to shoot.  And we had these scenes, and, and it was Al's [Al Freeman, Jr.] point where he got up and rallied everybody.  So we try to shoot the scenes.  It's not working.  So Al came to me, says, "Come here, man."  He says, "It ain't working."  I said, "What do--what's wrong with it, Al?"  He says, "I wouldn't say this."  I said, "What would you say?"  He said, "Well"--I said, "hold on a minute."  So I said, "Daphne [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid], come here.  Bring a pencil."  I said, "Go ahead, Al."  And Al said, "Well, what I would say is," and he just said what he would say.  And Daphne wrote down the words.  I said, "You feel good?"  He said, "Yeah, I feel it.  That's about what I should say."  I said, "All right."  I said, "Hold on a minute.  Daphne, go type that up, and get me some pages."  So she ran in the production trailer.  About fifteen minutes later, she came out with the pages.  I handed him the pages.  He looked at it.  I said, "You wanna change anything?"  He said, "Well, make this, changes, where he says, yeah, this is good.  I wanna say this."  So he started to turn away, and he stopped.  He came back, and he said, "Hey."  I said, "What?"  He said, "Don't you have to call somebody?"  I said, "Al, I am somebody."  Man, (laughter) Al looked at me, and he gave me a big hug.  He says, "In all my career, I have never had this happen."  And he went in there and did that scene, and it, it's a pretty powerful scene.

Speaker 1: That's the fun to me of, of movies and being a director, especially about culture.  That's why I get a little, a little prickly about when I see the culture of black America portrayed--I don't care who directs it, white or black, but when it's done with such flippant disregard for the research and the deep essence of the culture.  I mean we, we have--I've traveled the world, and I tell you, our, our culture is one of the most incredibly rich and strong cultures of any of that I've known.  Imagine, I mean we've been enslave--we were enslaved longer than we've been free, you know, four hundred years of the most draconian Holocaust the world has ever known.  I mean, we might as well been building the Pyramids with whips.  I mean it's, it's incredible what was done.  I mean when you think of people like King Leopold [Leopold II of Belgium], who probably is responsible for killing more human beings than any living person in the history of the world, what--anywhere from ten to twenty million, depending on who's telling the story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, nine years.
Speaker 1: Nine years.  Matter of fact, there's a saying in Congo [Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)] that every third person can trace their bloodline back to King Leopold, 'cause he fathered like thousands of children.  He cut off more hands and, and feet, thousands upon thousands in addition to people that he killed so that Goodrich [B.F. Goodrich Company; Goodrich Corporation] and all these tire companies could have rubber and cocoa and diamonds.  And then he turns around and he leaves and sells it to Belgium.  You know, when you look at that kind of draconian stuff and that here we are today with a black president [HistoryMaker Barack Obama] and billionaires.  I know at least five black billionaires.  That's an incredible accomplishment.  Why we seem to always wanna portray the negative?  Why we always wanna portray the victim side of being black in America or England or anywhere is beyond me.  I, I have not yet quite figured that out.  And that's why I created Legacy Media Institute and other things to talk to young filmmakers and say, [W.E.B.] DuBois is right.  William Paley is right, you know.  All art is propaganda.  I don't care what anybody tries to tell you.  There's nothing made, nothing I've made, nothing anybody has ever made that wasn't a part of propaganda.  Michelangelo's 'David' is one of the purest forms of sculpture propaganda ever created by a human being, pure propaganda.
Story_ID: 293837
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, 1998--a production called 'Linc's'--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, you, you played in a number of episodes, I guess in this, right?
Speaker 2: I only--I actually only--
Speaker 1: Just one?
Speaker 2: --did one epi--two episodes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I directed most of them and co-created it with my writing partner, Susan Fales-Hill.  She is, extraordinary writer and, and one of my dearest friends.  Because of her involvement, we were able to sell the concept to Showtime.  Again, it was a bar.  It was sort of my wink at 'Frank's Place,' different energy, but still the wink at 'Frank's Place,' but more political.  The character [Russell 'Linc' Lincoln] that I was going to play, Steven Williams played, 'Linc's,' I'd written it for myself.  This was another pilot I had written for myself and decided, no, I wanna direct this and produce it.  So I--we, we cast Steven Williams in it.  And he played a black Republican, which was certainly unique at that time.  And it was a very political show.  It was very powerful show, again, some of the best reviews I've ever received in any of my productions.  The network, again, Showtime, and Jerry Offsay at the time, just did not quite understand what we were trying to do.  They kept saying, "Stop with all the politics."  But it is a political bar.  "Stop with all the politics, more sex, more cursing, more sex," you know, and we had a horrible show that we followed that was just sex.  It was just grotesque sex for me in terms of its speak--as a theme, just was way over the line.  And then we followed it.  So it really, you know, we had to pump a little bit of our dialogue and, and stuff.  I didn't particularly care for that, but it was a bar, and I felt we could get with it.  And Pam Grier was game, and all the actors, and, man, it was, it was a good cast.  And they worked hard, and we shot three-camera film, the old Lucille Ball style--four walls.  They did put a laugh track in it.  And we, we made some incredible statements, I think.  I'd like to see that show put on some form of distribution in terms of--well, it can't be DVD now, but maybe video-on-demand or something 'cause when you look back at what we were saying politically, and the kind of people we had in it, you know, Gregory Hines and we had everybody, with Sam Jackson[AW1] [Samuel L. Jackson].  We had the first acting by--Master P.  I mean, we had everybody in there, every--yeah, and we would get calls, Dennis Rodman.  And we'd get calls.  "Hey, man, can I be in the show?"  They'd just walk on.
Story_ID: 293838
Speaker 1: Johnnie Cochran, my dear friend, Johnnie Cochran, was in it ['Linc's'] twice.[AW2]  One day (laughter), Johnnie Cochran comes on the set one day, hanging out on the set, and I said, "Johnnie, you here?"  He said, "Yeah."  I said, "all right, Johnny, look, I want you in the scene."  He said, "What?  What do I do?"  I said, "Just go and open up that door and walk in.  The cameras are rolling."  And he didn't know that on the other side of the door, my wife [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid], who played a hooker, was dressed in these hooker clothes.  And I went and I told her, I said, "Johnnie's out there.  I want you to pretend Johnnie's your next client," (laughter).  She said, "Okay."  Johnnie doesn't know what he's getting into (laughter).  So, "Action!"  She goes and the guy (laughter)--Johnnie--a guy leaves.  Johnnie opens the door, boom-boom.  She opens the door and says, "Oh, you're here?  You're early.  I'm not ready for you."  And he's looking at her.  He doesn't know what to say.  He doesn't know what--ah, bah, bah.  She just slams the door (laughter).  Johnnie looked at me and say, "Ah, man, you."  And then I had Johnnie--which should be seen again.  I had Johnnie do a slam.  He did a slam about legal stuff that was really quite clever.  We had him do that, one episode.  But we had some great people in there.  We did some wonderful--Obba Babatunde did a wonderful show about a Vietnam [War] vet who was held at a bar hostage and was gonna commit suicide, and it was the whole trials and tribulations of these Afghan veterans coming home after that and what's going on now in, in the world.  So it was, again, a show that went against the network's wishes and was more political than it should have been.  We did thirty-three episodes.  It was a fight, God, every one of 'em was a fight.  But we did some good work.[12:04:38:25]
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Will anybody ever see it again?  I don't know.  But it was, it was some good work.
Speaker 2: Somehow, I think everything is gonna be seen again--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) One day, I'm sure you're right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) with the way that, that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --the media is going these days, it seems like everything's gonna be seen.
Speaker 1: It's up for--media is like a piranha.  It's just eating everything.
Story_ID: 293839
Speaker 1: So what about 'Just Deserts' in '99 [1999].
Speaker 2: 'Just Deserts' was a pilot that I did with Joel McCrea, and I got to reprise an old Rod Sterling, 'Twilight Zone' ['The Twilight Zone'] piece that--
Speaker 1: William Shatner.
Speaker 2: William Shatner did on a plane where he--with the monster on the wing.  Well, I got to reprise that kind of a performance in, in that.  And the idea was that the pilot, my character's used that--like, he, the worst could happen, your (unclear) deserts, and you do a bad thing, karma gets you in the end.  But it was a pilot.  It didn't go.  But it was great working with Joel McCrea.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about 'Alley Cats Strike' in 2000?
Speaker 2: That was a, that was a TV movie for, I believe, Disney [Channel].  And I happened to play this, this character [Mayor McLemore], a dad.  And the guy [Robert Ri'chard] who played my son in this was the guy who played me in 'It' [sic.] (laughter) as a young kid.  So it was a, it was a cute kind of occurrence there.  We shot that up in Canada, too.
Story_ID: 293840
Speaker 1: Are you shooting things by now in New Millennium Studios [Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, New Millennium Studio's struggling, but we're still here.  It's been--going into our sixteenth year.
Speaker 1: No, no, by 2000, are you (unclear), are you working (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, in 2000, oh, yes.  Two-thousand [2000] is--we opened up with a gang bang operation.  We had, we did a movie starting Blair Underwood called 'Asunder.'  And then right after that, we did 'Linc's.'  We created the series 'Linc's,' which was the first series to shoot outside--half-hour comedy, to shoot outside of New York [New York] and L.A. [Los Angeles, California] since 'The Jackie Gleason Show.'  And nobody thought we could do a half-hour comedy in little 'ole Petersburg, Virginia.  Then we did a, another piece, and then we got into some issues here locally that made it very difficult for us, struggling and trying to keep the studio going.  It, it's been, probably of all the things that I've done, this has been the most difficult in, in--it's going against a headwind that has never relented.  Would I do it again?  Hell, no.  I would, you know, but, you gotta remember, when I decided to do this, the studio model was still in vogue.  Canada had not done its, its deed of paying for people to come up there.  The whole Canadian phenomena had not happened yet.  Wilmington was just really getting into its strength.[AW3]  So as studio that could garner TV movies--I had a deal at CBS with Johnson & Johnson who was my financers.  And we had made three films, one award-winning film, 'About Sarah,' and Richard Kiley's last movie, 'Blue Moon.'  So they had all been, planned to be--shoot here.  So we had this thing working.  Then all of a sudden the resistance against what we were doing here became almost unbearable.  I mean we just got into everything you could think of.  People were just coming out of nowhere, unions and everything was just--people were resistant to what we were doing and--
Speaker 1: Where was this coming from?  I mean what--
Speaker 2: Coming from the community.  They used to call this place Little Africa, coming from the unions at that time that I made my peace with 'cause you should.  They're formidable people, and they--I thought, I thought we could work out a just settlement, and we did.
Speaker 1: This--I'm trying to figure this out.  Now, I know that--my mind is going on this.  I know Virginia Beach [Virginia] is the home of 'The 700 Club' and a lot of stuff.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: A lot of the stuff close by is a lot of right-wing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --activity going on.  Is this what we're talking about, the political--
Speaker 2: No, we're talking about the tradition of, of the South, the tradition of Virginia.  You know, racism still lives, and, and I think there was a lot of resistance to--this was the, this is the first full-service studio to be built in Virginia.
Story_ID: 293841
Speaker 1: There were some people who were trying to get the legislature [Virginia General Assembly] to put up $25 million and a bond to build a studio, and I came in with a lot less and did it [with New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia].  And that created a backlash.  The fact that a black man could go out and create his own propaganda, you know, was a backlash.  There was a lot going against what we were trying to do that I had not anticipated.  I never got--I would say, I've been here, what?  Sixteen years.  I would say right now in the history of this studio [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia], no more than five or six black directors has ever put foot on this property.  And, and I don't--I think basically what it, you know, what happens in our community is that there is a sense of [clearing throat], oh, well, I, you know, guess what?  I'll put it another way.  When I was a kid, my, my uncle used to always say to me--he was a hustler.  He used to always say, you know you--say, "You know their problem."  Say, "What?"  "They think white folks' ice is colder than ours."  And I think there was a little ice is colder than ours philosophy that was spreading among a lot of my colleagues that I couldn't be doing what I should be doing.  Thank God, Tyler Perry killed that.  I mean Tyler Perry took the model that I was trying to do here and made it work.  I wasn't able to make it work, and I can't blame a lot of people.  I can only blame that I am a, I'm a creative being.  My whole thing is creating, is creating content.  I'm not the greatest businessman in the world, and, you know, it, it took me a few million dollars to find that out, but (laughter) I'm not the greatest businessman.  What I had hoped to happen--and I knew that when I started.  I knew that I was a creative--I can stay focused on creativity.  I'm a passionate creative person.  But, I don't like the business aspect.  I don't like bargaining and trying to--making deals and going out and getting the money.  I have to do it, but I don't like it.  It's not where my passion is.  My passion is in creating.  So my hope was that I would build this place, this land, one of the largest private parcels held in this community, that other people would come and say, "You know what?  I wanna work with you.  Here's the deal.  You give me some space.  I'll come and bring my thing there and help you build, and I'll build my thing."  Come on.  And props and designers, and that's what I hoped would happen here.  It didn't happen.  No one came to join.
Story_ID: 293842
Speaker 1: So here I am left with this huge, you know, facility [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia], and I have to fill it with my own creativity.  And it's--we've been managing to survive, but it's not the easiest thing I've ever attempted to do.  I would have been a lot more successful as a director and a producer had I not built this studio.  I probably wouldn't be in America.  I'd probably be in Nigeria or one of these other places that's popping right now.  And I may end up there.  But I, I blame myself really though.  I don't blame others.  I should have seen that coming.  I should have--I think my ego--not think--I know my ego to prove to Hollywood that I could be independent, to prove to them that I could do what they do.  I spent a lot of unnecessary time trying to prove to the industry that a black man could do what I was doing.  Waste of time.  They don't care (laughter).  Only I cared.  Why would they care?  I mean they gotta--they do it better than anybody in the world.  And I think--I look back on that, and I thought that's a, that is a flaw of mine.  And I think it--I know why, you know.  It comes from the days of growing up in segregation.  It comes from my civil rights time.  But I wasted a lot of time doing that.  I should have just stayed creative.  I should have cut--soon as I saw this deal, I should have sold this place when people wanted to buy it and moved on.  But my ego wouldn't let me do it, and now, what I've done, which I think I'm finding probably the most pleasure out of since I've been here, is that I created this thing called Legacy Media Institute, where I'm working with young, emerging filmmakers, not young in age, but young in the business, globally, England, Nigeria, Cuba, and here, of course, in historically black colleges [HBCUs].  And I, I just--I'm--now I'm offering and giving them office space.  And they're coming in here bringing--one of the young men who just got back from Nigeria, he said, can I have a meeting tomorrow.  A guy wants to shoot a music video.  I wanna do it.  I said, "Come on, me.  That's your office.  You don't have to pay me a dime.  Be creative.  Create a business for yourself.  Give me a job."  And one of the other kids--we're now editing, finishing editing on his feature film.  He raised his money.  He said, "Will you help me produce it?  I've never produced a film."  "We'll produce it for you.  And we'll raise a little bit more money."  And we just produced his film.  It's called 'Troop 491' ['Troop 491: The Adventures of the Muddy Lions'].  It's a wonderful little film.  It's aimed at the urban market and it's a very different kind of film.  He was part of our group, a kid who just DP'd [director of photography] on--I just shot a pilot, another pilot of mine, very unusual pilot meant for the international market.  This kid that I started out when he was in elementary school, young, white kid from the neighborhood.  He was my DP [director of photography], first time he ever DP'd was on this pilot.  And the kid who was the focus puller, first time he ever focus pulled.  He's a young kid, was in my class.  I got kids over in London [England] that are shooting now, first time.  They all bring me their stuff.  So I've got this sort of nucleus of young people to do what I intended to do sixteen years ago.  They're doing it, and I probably won't financially benefit from it, but the dream is alive.  I'm seeing them do what I had hoped to do.  And I'm telling them my mistakes.  Don't make the mistake.  Don't get caught up in the politics of this.  Don't try to prove yourself.  Be yourself.  You know, if, if you wanna do something, do it.  Don't get caught up in it.  Don't expect anybody to come and help you.  They're not coming.  You don't need them.  You just do your job the best you can do.  Learn your craft.  Be as good as you possibly can be.  Ignore--mediocrity.  Work with people who wanna work with you.  Don't try to save the world.  Save yourself.  And there's a wonderful (laughter) thing I heard the other day, says, that old saying that says you, you teach a man to fish--I mean you give a man a fish.  He eats for a day.  Say, well, don't give the man the fish.  Eat it yourself.  Fishing ain't that hard (laughter).  That's kinda now my philosophy (laughter).  You know, I help those who help themselves, but I ain't teaching nobody to fish.  Fishin' ain't that hard.  Get a pole (laughter), you know, leave me alone.  I'm busy fishing, you know.
Story_ID: 293843
Speaker 1: The future of this place [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia] then, I mean from what you're saying, you may not be in it long.
Speaker 2: No, the future of this place is gonna be ruled by the young filmmakers that come through here.  My future is, I've just converted one of my spaces here, one of my buildings, into an art studio.  I'm gonna do--this is, this is me time.  I'm gonna go back into sculpting.  I took up sculpting about, what, seven years ago, eight years ago.  I found that, at that time, I, I discovered I had cancer.  And I had to do something about it.  And I took up sculpting to get my mind off of the, the fight.  And I fell in love with sculpting.  I studied in France, I mean in Italy, and so I'm building a--I'm finishing up.  They've already been working on it, a sculpting studio over there.  And I'm gonna go in there when I come back from London [England] and spend as many days and mornings and nights as I can in their sculpting.  And I'm gonna turn this into what it is, a place for young people to come in here and create.  And if it goes, it goes.  If it goes, I'll end up somewhere in, in Africa or the Islands, probably doing what I do, you know.  It's a big world out there.  I mean this, this whole thing--I, I tried to tell somebody the other day, I said, "Why are you worrying, trying to compete with Tyler Perry or any Perry.  Why?  There're only forty million black people"--if you're going for the black market, "in this country.  Do you know how many people speak Portuguese of African descent?  Over twenty-five million people speak Portuguese of African descent.  They got no content, not in their language.  Why don't you create something and subtitle it in Portuguese and aim for that market.  Forget that market.  Don't forget it, but don't lose your mind trying to grab something that hungry person is going for.  Find a place that is accessible"--and one thing I learned about being in Nigeria, this industry that they're creating is, it's, it's on speed.  It's the most incredible thing happening in film right now.
Speaker 1: What they call Nollywood.
Speaker 2: Nollywood, it is just this amalgamation of energy and, and critical mass, and it's, it's like a, it's like a free radical, just bouncing, a ping-pong ball in a room of nothing but marble walls (laughter).  Where it's gonna stop, who knows--
Story_ID: 293844
Speaker 1: One thing they [Nollywood] do, and I was there [Nigeria], and the guy said this, and I will never forget it.  Somebody asked him, "How do you do what you do?"  He says, "It's simple.  There're only three rules in filmmaking.  Know your audience, know where they are, and use the existing means of distribution."  That's simple.  I'm thinking, wow, Tyler Perry's proven that.  Not only that, he's--that's his motto.  Know your audience.  Nobody knows that audience better than Tyler Perry.  That black woman, that churchgoing woman, that Saturday night guy.  Nobody knows it, you know, he and T.D. Jakes, you know, built a fortune off of an audience that most people ignored, turned their nose up to.  What a mistake it has been.  He knows how to get to them, you know.  And he uses existing means of transport--of distribution.  Duh?  And, and I think that sometimes we--in chasing the, the illusive brass ring, we, we set it in the hands of someone else.  And it's always in the hands of the people who control it.  Well, they can have that.  By the way, I don't even like brass.  I like gold (laughter).  And so why am I chasing a brass ring?  I have to go find me some gold.  And so I'm now looking at the, at the international market.  That's why I go to London [England].  I do this thing at the British Film Institute.  I go to Nigeria.  I go to Cape Verde.  I go to Ethiopia.  I'm doing a--a young man who's flown from London, I flew him in from London, he shoots a great deal, just got back from the Amazon, one of my fellows from my institute [Legacy Media Institute], he's down there editing now a piece for the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts [Richmond, Virginia].  They're doing their first exhibit on Ethiopia.  And guess what?  We're [New Millennium Studios] doing the video package 'cause he and I shoot in, in Ethiopia, and we're doing this great piece.  I was looking this footage, went over to the museum today.  And his footage matches the pieces in the museum.  It's gonna be nice piece.  You know, I bring him to do that.  That's where I think our, my future is as a filmmaker, is in knowing my audience, knowing where they are, and in using existing means of--if this studio is a part of it, so be it.  If it's not, you know.
Story_ID: 293845
Speaker 1: Just for the sake of history here, now, you've done documentaries.  You've done the history of Madame Walker [Madame C.J. Walker], you've the history of the State of Virginia for the Commonwealth [of Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's currently playing in the museum [Virginia Museum of Fine Arts] at Richmond [Virginia], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Got the--yeah, the 'Keepers of the Flame' documentary, the history of Virginia, little ole poor black kid from colored town in Norfolk [Virginia], poor, has done the definitive history of Virginia.  (Laughter) I, I think--it's amazing.  I mean I, I remember the premiere we had at the capitol [Virginia State Capitol, Richmond, Virginia].  And I was sitting there thinking about this somewhat.  My grandma [Beulah Reid] would not believe this (laughter), of all people.  But, yeah, we do documentaries because that, that keeps, keeps us [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia] alive, pays the lights every now and then.  And I love the history of, of black America as it relates to this country.  I just love it.  I was just talking to a gentleman--I just had the pleasure of being the moderator for the session, The Richmond Forum [Richmond, Virginia], that had [Steven] Spielberg, Doris Kerns, and Tony Kushner. Kushner is nominated for an Oscar [Academy Award].  Of course, Spielberg is for 'Lincoln.'  And being the moderator of that for a hour and a half, talking about history, it was a delight, I mean to talk about Thaddeus [Stevens] and Elizabeth Keckley and, and Frederick Douglass, and the history of, of the Thirteenth Amendment.  And one of my favorite moments in the mod--in the session--it just aired on television here locally, was I asked them, "What was your favorite moment?  If you can pick a moment in the movie that would be your favorite, what is it?"  And all three of them went around and said their favorite.  And even Spielberg said another one, and she said another one, and finally, it came (unclear), I said, "My favorite was the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment," (laughter).  I mean, (laughter) duh?  You know, that's--and, and when you think about that, you see we--that's why I say, the history of black America is so unique.  We, we black people, we, we let things like that kind of go by, like it's like, today is Tuesday.  The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment was the moment that we became free.  It wasn't the Emancipation Proclamation that we've all been given the credit to, give credit to.  It wasn't that.  Matter of fact, if--at the end of the [Civil] War, with the Emancipation Procla--we'd have gone back into slavery (laughter), you know, except those soldiers from the North.  We'd have all stayed in slavery.  It was the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment that gave us our freedom.  And, and I think seeing the movie, 'Lincoln,' what I loved about it--I don't care whatever flaws people find in it, was that's what the movie was about.  I had no idea that this whole movie would be about the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment and, and how it almost destroyed the political system in this country and how Lincoln and this dogmatic, "I'm gonna do this."  You know, his wife [Mary Todd Lincoln] was against--everybody was against him.  And he did it.  That's a, that's an incredible story to tell.
Story_ID: 293846
Speaker 1: We need to tell more.  One of the stories I wanna tell, and I talked to [Steven] Spielberg about this, is Elizabeth Keckley.  That's my, gonna be my next documentary ['Tim Reid's Legacy Documentary Series: The Life & Times of Elizabeth Keckley'] that we do here [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Now, that was the seamstress and the--
Speaker 1: She was a dressmaker, dressmaker for Mary Todd [Lincoln] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) (unclear) for Mary Todd Lincoln.
Speaker 1: Well, here's some little history.  She's from Petersburg, Virginia.  She was a slave in Dinwiddie [County, Virginia], about five minutes from here, and then she--and she got her freedom.  She stayed here, and she had a--started her shop here and came back a few times.  Well, here's an interesting thing about the character, she was not only a dressmaker.  She was a--an abolitionist and a political activist, that even involved Frederick Douglass.  Matter of fact, Frederick Douglass took over an organization that she started, and the thing about her--two things about her that I find quite unique.  One is, she was also the dressmaker for Jefferson Davis' wife [Varina Davis].  And when--before she went to see, went to work for Mary Todd, she was offered the job by Jefferson Davis' wife.  I think her name is Jeanie [sic.], or whatever it is.  But anyway, I try to forget Jefferson Davis' lifeline.  But anyway, she, she (laughter), she turned down Jefferson Davis' wife to come live and work for her and make dresses.  But she did make some dresses for Jeff--for her.  Then she went and worked for Mary Todd.  Well, you know, she's the first person in America to write a tell-all book about their life, her life in the, in the White House, one that wrecked and created such a--I mean she was hated by Mary Todd 'til the day Mary Todd died.  I mean it created an incredible stink in America (laughter).  So she was an author.  Now, one of my favorite parts, as I said, I'm sort of living in Virginia, it ain't--that ain't hard to be involved in history 24/7.  But I always joke with my Virginia gentleman friends about Jefferson Davis.  When the Union Army was arriving up near the capitol [Virginia State Capitol] in downtown Richmond [Virginia].  He was in church.  Word came, the Union Army (laughter) is next block.  "You gotta get outta here.  How are we gonna get outta here?"  Well, they rush him in the back, and he puts on one of his wife's dresses.  And he escaped Richmond dressed as a woman.  You know, that Elizabeth Keckley made the dress (laughter).  Isn't that great.  I love history.  You can't make this stuff up.

Speaker 1: And see, you see those are the kind of things--when we [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia] were doing Maggie [L.] Walker, which I think would make an incredible movie, not just that she was a successful businesswoman, and had the first elevator in a home in Richmond, Virginia was in her house.  She, she was close friends with--FDR, Franklin Delano [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] because she was also cripple at the time.  And they were like cripple mates--they were tight.  Matter of fact, he held up his inauguration so that she could get there (laughter).  I mean Maggie Walker--but here's an interesting thing about Maggie Walker that I did not know until we delved into this story.  We try to get into it deep because I wanna put flesh and bones on these characters, not just, they did this and she had a department store because a man wouldn't let one of her friends put on a hat without a bag.  And she said, how dare you?  So she built a department store, had designers come from France, designers.  She sold couture clothing and hats and stuff like that, made by black people.  They put her out of business, by the way.  The, the town got together and they had--this woman can't be successful.  She had a newspaper.  Well, one of the things that happened to her is one day her husband [Armstead Walker, Jr.] was shot and killed by his son in her house.  Until this day, it almost ruined her career because the, the stories behind why the son killed the father and next door to the maid--I mean there's some real salacious kind of stories that arose out of that.  Well, that's incredible drama, to a woman who was--I mean just a unbelievable woman politically and, and businesswoman and all that.  Well, those kinds of stories, I think are what Hollywood really looks for when you tell a story.  Well, we've got 'em.  Why don't we tell them?  That's what I'd like to do, is tell those stories.  So we have to wait, not wait.  There's no waiting.  We have to find new financing models.  When I say we--we independents.  Hollywood has the best, but always going to Hollywood with these stories is not gonna work.  Hollywood's not gonna give me money to make that story.  It's not of their interest.  And if, so, they wanna tell it in the way they wanna tell it.  I wanna tell it my way, and I can't ask them to give me any money.  They're not gonna give it to me.  Now, what I wanna do is create these financing models that will finance these stories.  I'm able to do it with documentaries, but now, I wanna step up and do it with a larger forum, and keep the budgets down.  With the equipment we own, we can do that.

Speaker 1: Maggie [L.] Walker was one of the most powerful women in the South, both politically.  She was a financial wizard.  She created the first penny bank [St. Luke Penny Savings Bank].  She created--she was the first bank founder, female, let alone black female, the first female bank founder, and president of a bank.  There's a woman [Mary Eleanor Brackenridge], a white woman in Texas who was the president of a bank after her husband [sic. father] died, before Maggie.  But Maggie, Maggie Walker was the first founder, female founder and the first black woman to be president of a bank in the history of America.  She also built the first department store [St. Luke Emporium] owned by a black woman because she was angry that one of her friends went to a local, one of the local big department stores here, chains, and they wouldn't let the woman try on a hat without putting a bag over her head because they didn't want her, her hair to touch the inside of the hat.  And Maggie Walker called the owner of the bank--I mean of the, of the department store and said--he, "Well, Maggie, I didn't know that was your friend.  Next time, we'll put her in a private area."  And she said, "No you won't."  So she got a building and started a department store and brought in designers from France, hat makers and dressmakers who were black, and they were very successful (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was the name of the store? Was it (unclear)?
Speaker 1: That I don't know.  I think it was something Walker's [ph.], something Walkers.  She also had a newspaper.  She was very wealthy, very successful, insurance, but she also hired more black women during, during the [Great] Depression than anyone in the state.  And she taught them.  She had a school.  So she would take women who were in, you know, women who had had children, women who were thrown--you know, discarded by society.  She would take 'em and put 'em in school and teach accounting skills and then hire them.  And so they all end up working for her.  She had this regiment of people who she trained, educated and then put to work.  And she had branches.  I mean a very successful woman, close confidant of [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt [FDR].  She was--and the day of her death--her house is in Richmond [Virginia], there are pictures of it, thousands of people, black and white stood outside of her house, once she was announced passed.
Speaker 2: So did she pass in the '40s [1940s] [sic. 1934], or was it?
Speaker 1: I don't quite have the date.  Let's see.  I don't wanna give the date 'cause I'll probably say it wrong (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay. All right.
Speaker 1: But incredible woman, one of my heroes, and one of the little-known characters because the proximity of her name with Madame C.J. Walker, who was, in her own right, a millionaire and very successful, of not--and the first black millionaire female in America.  But Maggie Walker, a different kind of businesswoman, very successful, tragic, a lot of tragedy in her life.  She was crippled, diabetes.  Her husband [Armstead Walker, Jr.] was killed in her home by her son.  I mean it was, there's a lot of story here that is unbelievable.  You couldn't--it's like a 'CSI' ['CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'] episode (laughter).

Speaker 1: Since New Millennium [Studios, Petersburg, Virginia] started and, did you open in 2000 or around (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we opened in '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: --Ninety-eight [1998]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we opened '98 [1998], and, and then after we, we got sort of shaken by the, the resistance to the studio, we decided to go in and begin to make documentaries ['Tim Reid's Legacy Documentary Series'].  And we started making documentaries on, on the incredible culture of people of African descent around the world.  I would travel to Brazil, and I'd tell a story and come back and, and we started writing these stories.  And I'd go to France, and I did some stuff at the beach on Normandy [France] about the arrival of black troops as the Red Ball Express ['Tim Reid's Legacy Documentary Series: The Red Ball Express'], the builders of the Alaskan Highway ['Tim Reid's Legacy Documentary Series: Builders of the Alaskan Highway'].  Most people don't know that blacks built three quarters of the Alaskan Highway, or the Alcorn Highway, the largest engineering feet outside of the Panama Canal at that time, incredible thing in, in like six or seven months.  It, it's a story that should be, certainly a motion picture.  So we start doing these documentaries, Blind Tom ['Tim Reid's Legacy Documentary Series: Blind Tom'] and Oscar Micheaux ['Tim Reid's Legacy Documentary Series: Oscar Micheaux'].  I'd go to Gregory, North Dakota, and I sat there and--where he lived in a little shack in that homestead out there and told his story.  So we--
Speaker 1: You (unclear) the movie on Blind Tom.  Did you do that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did the movie on--I did a documentary on Blind Tom.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw some of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did a documentary with another producer--
Speaker 1: I never realized who did it.
Speaker 2: --Yeah, another producer friend [HistoryMaker DeWayne Wickham], black guy, and I got together and teamed together.  We did that.  We did, gosh, we've done so--we did the life of Reginald Lewis, another one of my heroes.  We did his story.  Gosh, we, we--we've done Pocahontas Island ['The Enduring Legacy of Pocahontas Island'], one of the oldest, free black communities in America, about this incredible group of people who created one of the most powerful communities.  One of them left and became president of Liberia.  I mean it's just (laughter), the history is, is so rich and so wonderful.  The bombing of Tulsa [Oklahoma] in 1921, 'The Day They Bombed the Promised Land,' award-winning doc [documentary] that actually, before he passed, Johnnie Cochran was using as part of his deposition to get reparations for blacks in, in Tulsa.  What else we've done?  Gosh, we, we've done quite a bit.  You know, we've done the history on one of my favorite places in Africa, Cape Verde.  We're doing a thing on the African slave trade, Atlantic Slave Trade and Cape Verde enters--we don't know much about Cape Verde, but it, it has a prime position in the foundation of plantation slavery.  It was practiced there before it was brought to America by the Portuguese (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah (unclear), yeah, Robert Rich [ph.] actually, you know, operated out of Cape Verde is the, the person that Richmond is named after, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, okay.  I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a book about him that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Cape Verde is--one of my favorite characters that I remember as a kid--you might remember the name.  His name was Daddy Grace [Marcelino Manuel da Graca; Charles Manuel "Sweet Daddy" Grace]. "Sweet Daddy" Grace.  He was a bishop, had his own church, had ear--fingernails out to here, long white hair.  He used to come on the parade every Fourth of July and fascinating character.  Well, one day I was in Fogo, in Cape Verde, and I was talking to some friends of mine.  And he said, "You know who's from here?"  I said, "What?"  "'Sweet Daddy' Grace."  I went, "What?  He's from Cape Verde?"  Never knew.  So there's incredible history and movement of, of people of African descent.
Story_ID: 292618
Speaker 1: I go down to Cuba.  I did a, I did a documentary ['Tim Reid's Legacy Documentary Series: Cuba's Untold Story of Race & Rage'] in Cuba on the first multi-racial political party in the history of--in this hemisphere--was the people, Independent People of Color [Partido Independiente de Color] in Cuba right after the War of Cuban Independence [Cuban War of Independence].  We call it the Spanish-American War, but the War of Cuban Independence.  And they were so powerful that the United States Army and the then-regime in Cuba got together to stop them from being powerful and their political party to crush it.  And one day the Cuban police--I mean, not police, the military slaughtered the largest massacre of human beings in this hemisphere at one time, was in Cuba in 1912.  They killed, in two days, somewhere in the neighborhood of almost three thousand people and celebrated it every year, once a year in the park in Cuba, down in Havana.  They celebrated it until the Cuban Revolution when [Fidel] Castro took over, and they stopped the celebration.  And well, we did a documentary on that, and we went to Cuba.  And Castro made it possible for my partner, [HistoryMaker] DeWayne Wickham, journalist for USA Today, that I--and I, to go into the--the library and literally open up the documents and newspapers that had never been opened since.  And they were literally almost crumbling as we put 'em on the scanner because they had never been--Cubans don't know this history.  So there's such rich history that are--that's around that--I mean I could work five days a week, all day for the next ten years, just making documentaries and be a happy camper.
Speaker 2: So the emphasis on bringing in young filmmakers serves a purpose--
Speaker 1: They do--they work, they do projects (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in here they can--
Speaker 1: --They can hear.  We shoot projects.  A of them are gonna work on the Elizabeth Keckley project ['Tim Reid's Legacy Documentary Series: The Life & Times of Elizabeth Keckley'].  We gotta another project.  We're gonna shoot something in the U.K. [United Kingdom].  I take 'em with me when I work, you know.  I'm gonna take four with me when I go to London [England], and we got a small grant.  You know, we're gonna take--we don't have a lotta money, but we, we try to spend it with enriching the lives of young filmmakers 'cause they're the future, and if we don't get them to, to begin to understand the power that they have, we're gonna keep getting housewives of some city.
Story_ID: 292619
Speaker 1: On the drama side, so you did a lot of dramas in the beginning.  Do you do as many anymore like (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would like to, but I haven't.  This--I just did a pilot, a drama pilot called 'Blues in the Night' with a young lady [Andrea Pennington] from America, but she lives in the South of France, in Monte Carlo [France].  And she came over, and she acted in this piece.  So, she's a great singer, a great actress, and that's gonna be an international series.  I'm gonna try to sell it internationally before I bring it here.
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of the ones--I know 'For Real,' I've been trying to get it, and I can't get it online (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we can give you a copy before you leave (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, and what are some of the--'For Real' is based on 'Pygmalion' [George Bernard Shaw], right?  It's like (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a, it as a series, I mean a movie that I wrote many years ago for CBS.  And we almost got it made.  It was called 'Duet.'  And it was me and another young writer, Shirley Pierce Brown [ph.], who wrote the script, based on my, my story.  And I couldn't get it done.  And so I got a little money, from--a very dear friend came into some money and said, look, you need to make something here.  Make this, take this.  And it wasn't a lot, but it was enough to do what I had to do, and I decided what would I wanna make?  And people had gotten angry with me 'cause I did 'Asunder,' and they, "All right, what kinda movie you wanna make?"  So I said, "I wanna do this 'Pygmalion,' this sort of, you know, street urchin that gets, you know, it's 'My Fair Lady,' but it's, mine is 'My Fair Lady' from the Hood (laughter).  So we, we named it 'For Real' and found an actress [Tamara 'Gingir' Curry]--did a screen test and a search, found a young actress in Washington [D.C.] and brought her down here, and we shot the movie right here at the studio [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia].  And we had about forty music cues, wrote music for it.  It was a, it was a decent movie, wasn't a great movie, but it was a decent movie.  I liked it, made--we made a statement politically about it, you know.  I got my propaganda in there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 292620
Speaker 1: Any of the pieces that you [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia] produce--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --are they--I mean distribution being what it is, 'cause I tried to get 'For Real.'  I went online.  I looked through Amazon [Amazon.com, Inc.], looked everywhere (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's not--it should be--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) looked on your website, and I couldn't even get it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, is that right?
Speaker 1: Off the web, yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't even get it.
Speaker 2: Our website, you know, that's another thing.  We gotta find a young person that does the Internet better than we do it here.  We, at one time were, we were through Blockbuster [Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc.; Blockbuster LLC].  When Blockbuster went south, it really hurt us because we had not made our independent entry into video-on-demand, into online sales.  We, we were the first African American direct vendor with Blockbuster.  We shipped our stuff straight to Texas.  We packaged, we did all that.  We made a, a wonderful deal.  We had, at one time, five titles in the, in Blockbuster at one time.  We were doing very well.  And we were gonna then take our documentary series and take it there.  But, as you know, there is no VHS business anymore.  I mean at one time, you could make a lot of money in straight to video.  You could make a lot of money.  But the business model changed, and you got, all of a sudden, this sort of Internet thing.  So now, there are no real--there is no big money now, left in V--certainly, no VHS.  And the DVD now market, is just about gone.  Matter of fact, I was just talking to someone who brought a new computer.  There's not even a DVD player in it.  So--this a brand new Apple computer.  They don't--it's gone.  The DVD business, they're through with it.  Now, there'll still be some remnants of it, but as a business model, you can't get an investor to jump in because there's no upside potentially for it.
Speaker 1: It's digital all the way now.
Speaker 2: It's all now video-on-demand.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But the same people who control the major studios, and the major distributors, control the video-on-demand, the--you know, they're getting their stuff in.
Story_ID: 292621
Speaker 1: So the independents [independent filmmakers] have got to find a way to create a different model.  Now, YouTube, everybody is saying YouTube.  You can't make any money with YouTube.  And if you--and these kids, you know, what YouTube is doing and, and Google are doing and Amazon [Amazon.com, Inc.] is doing, they're now going into my business.  They're building studios, small studios in major markets, and they're saying to filmmakers, "Come here.  We'll give you the studio, cost you nothing.  We'll give you cameras.  Here's the catch.  Sign here, in perpetuity, we own your content.  We control you content in perpetuity."  So, I mean what's good is to be on--hopefully, the only thing you can hope for on, on YouTube showing your entire piece is that somebody from Hollywood will see you and give you a job.  And it happens occasionally.  That's what people are doing.  And I'm going, that's not an entrepreneur market.  That's a--that's why I like what the Nigerians are doing.  We've gotta, you know, we've gotta create entrepreneurs.  These young people coming out of college, you can't employ them all.  But they can start a business for themselves.  They can build their own studio.  It doesn't have to be this twenty--fifty acre facility.  It can be a small, you know, thing.  And then distribute their stuff.  I'd rather pay--I told a kid the other day.  He wanted to put something on YouTube for free.  I said, "Why?  Don't you know that if you got a thousand people to give you ninety-nine cents, it's more money than you'll ever make with your stuff on any of these channels.  You're just not gonna do it.  So why not set up your own system, you know.  And, yeah, it's hard.  You gotta market, you gotta figure out a way, but you're young and smart.  Things are changing.  You'll figure out a way."  But they don't think that way.  So we've got--where I am not is that I've gotta create some sort of international distribution system or tie into one, I should say, not create--I don't wanna build anything else.  And I, I'm close to doing that so that you--Ed Burns is a perfect example.  I love the Ed Burns model.  He is the Oscar Micheaux right now of film.  He makes a movie for fifty [50,000] to 100,000 dollars.  He shoots it on Canon 5Ds, just like the stuff I got here.  He turns around, because he has names in it, simple scripts.  He's not trying to do, you know, Atlantis [Alliance Atlantis Communications Inc.].  I mean he's (laughter), he's doing simple scripts.  And then he puts it on video-on-demand.  He'll do $500,000 in one day, you know.  Ava DuVernay, I mean what, what--Ava DuVernay, what she's done with her movie ['I Will Follow'].  I, I admire her tremendously.  Again, she took the model--I'm so busy trying to fight the big game.  She came in with a movie, 50,000 [dollars]--'I Will Follow,' put 50,000 in it, used her marketing skills, and built an industry.  And now she--in addition to getting a deal, she now has this marketing distribution system in place for people like myself or other people who make these small films.  There's an outlet that can use what they've created.  That's the future of the independent market.  I mean I can't go back.  I'm a runaway slave.  I ain't going back.  So the independent-thinking people, have to create distribution if they're gonna survive because the days of people giving you money on an idea gone, so you've gotta create a distribution.  You've gotta be able to get paid.  So that's why I'm doing small projects--50,000, 75,000 dollar documentaries because I can get my money back.  I can do ten showings in places across the country and I can make ten [10,000] or 15,000, ain't a lot to Tyler Perry.  But pays my mortgage, you know.  So, you know, I'm in the survival business.
Story_ID: 292622
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I don't, I don't usually look at life that way, going back and changing, you know.  Yeah, there's a lot of things I would change.  I don't necessarily mean the deed.  It's just maybe, if anything, the way I responded to it, as opposed to changing the deed.  But I can say that if I look back on my life now, I don't have a lot of regrets, very few regrets.  I have a hell of a lot of questions, but very few regrets.  And, you know, a lot of questions to myself and to, and the people around me.  I can't understand sometimes why people spend so much time to win your favor, to distrust--to show you distrust.  I mean if you're gonna spend a year or two building a relationship, why, once you get it, do you dishonor it?  Why spend all that time?  (Laughter) You know, all right, but why?  What was in that, you know?  If you're gonna spend all that time to build it, make it work for you, you know, but I have a lot of, lot of--I've seen, I've seen some things that, to this day, I haven't quite figured out the question of, you know, was that really necessary, you know, either things that I've done or things that I've, I've had done to me, just--that wasn't, wasn't necessary. So when I look back, no regrets.  I've learned the lesson, but I got a lot of questions.
Story_ID: 292623
Speaker 1: I was thinking about something you said a while ago about, you know, having built this [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia], you would thought--you would have thought that others would have come--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to help, you know, to add on to it.  And, you know, I thought about the model for the movie, 'Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored,' and all the actors seemed to jump in, everybody--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Taj Mahal, everyone (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everybody came.
Speaker 1: --came in, and, you know, Isaac Hayes--
Speaker 2: Everybody.
Speaker 1: --come in and contribute.  A lot of other projects, it's like that, but why do you think it hasn't been true with the studio?
Speaker 2: Obviously, the reason that people didn't come or have not rallied around some of my dreams, I would have to say has to do with me.  I'm not too fond of placing blame on others, and I'm also not in the business of, of suffering and guilt.  But I do think a lot of the reasons that people didn't come here had to do with, with me, how--my personality.  I mean, I often ask, ask friends, close friends, say, "Come on now, be honest with me.  You know, what is it?  I know I can be prickly, and I'm, you know, I'm very determined and most directors are in and most people are.  What is it?"  And I think, somebody was telling me, they say, "Well, you give off an air of independence, you know, that a lot of people just say, 'Well, don't need to help him.  He don't need no help.'"  And I remember--I think it was Clint Eastwood or someone once said--I think it was Clint Eastwood that said, "The amazing thing about success is that no one thinks you need help," (laughter).  No one thinks you need a day of--can I help you today, you know.  And the help comes in different forms, and I think that's a little bit of it.  I, I've always--if there's any bone I'd like to pick with some of the people I've worked with or employed or brought into the system, which I don't--I think is a bit about our culture, our culture, people of African descent more than any other race I've seen, certainly, more than some of the people who, who are of, religiously of Jewish persuasion, is that--how can I put this?  It--if I, if I do something for you, if I--not ask, if I perform a deed that brings wealth to you or gives you a job, you have no obligations to do anything for me at all.  I did that because I needed your, your talent, I needed your, whatever it is.  But I would think in that gesture, you would feel a sense of, this person had my interests.  So when you got a chance to do something, you would think, okay, who do I want to pass it on, pass it forward to?  You would think, well, that person was there for me.  Let me go and be there for that person.  And I say, I mean Jews are renowned for that.  People of African descent seem to have a little problem with that.  And I've not figured out why, you know, the people that I have put food on their table at various levels of various areas, have not said, you know, just offer--and a few have.  I, I won't say--this is not a definitive statement, but the majority have not.  And, and that I don't understand because in me, the way I was taught in the black community which I grew up, is that in order to survive, in order to prosper, that you had to do that.  It's part of my nature.  It's part of the way I was taught.
Story_ID: 292624
Speaker 1: I go back to my community [Norfolk, Virginia].  I'm involved in the university [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] that gave me an opportunity to pull, not only myself up by my bootstrap, that gave me some money to buy a boot.  That university is important in my life, and it'll always be important in my life.  It's in my will.
Speaker 2: That's Norfolk State.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Norfolk State University 'cause I was nobody.  I was nothing 'til I got to that university.  And the blessing that I got there, I remember I was dating a young girl and was love--she was gonna be the--I was gonna marry.  She was--that was the most, my first love--I was crazy about her.  And I had just--this was it.  I didn't want anybody else, gorgeous, beautiful, wonderful person.  And one day her father said, "I wanna talk to you, young man."  We sat on the porch.  I can feel like it was yesterday.  He said, "What are your goals?"  I was like, "What do you mean goals?"  "What do you, what do you aspire to be?"  Like, huh?  I don't know.  I'm me, I'm me.  I'm a get a job.  Ah, get a job.  "Do you have any interests?"  "Well, you know"--I had no answers for this man.  He humiliated me to the end of which I, I'm just sitting here (laughter), and I've often thought about him in the successful part of my life, and say, what do you think of me now?  But, he was so right.  He was protecting his daughter.  I had no visions of anything.  Actually, that conversation helped me because it was true.  I had no vision.  I had no goals as a--'cause I was, only been in college a few months.  I didn't even think about going--my grades were horrible.  I was, I was lucky to be there.  Had it not been for this college putting me in on probation, I couldn't get into a college.  This is little, then small, little college allowed me an opportunity, and I made the best of it.  But he was right.  I didn't like it, but he was right.  I take giving back important to my going forward.  The blessings that I have is because of what I've given through and given back.  So I've often wondered why people don't do that.  A few have.  I have some dear friends who, who we interchange, but, you know, I haven't figured out yet some of 'em.  Some of 'em that I, you know, I've, I've helped.  I've given them their first shot at the level at which they work.  I mean not just actors.  I'm talking about people behind the scenes, and I'm going--I mean I've fought for people.  I've literally took, took a couple bullets for people against the unions, against the business.  I mean some people who were unemployable, insurance wise and take out insurance with Lloyd's of London so that they could work 'cause nobody would hire them.  Never gave me a job, never called and offered.  That bothers--that bothers me, that people--not that they didn't do it, but it bothers me that people don't understand the power of coming together as a unit, coming together as a, as a family culturally and looking out for one another.  I mean it's too late for me, but I hope my grandkids, you know, which will be different because, you know, I got a multi-racial.  I got, I got a half--half-Korean grandson.  I got, I got a granddaughter who's Iranian.  I got my other granddaughter, her blood is black Creole.  I mean I got an interesting family there.  My, my family looks like a Benetton [United Colors of Benetton] commercial.  But they--their world will be different, and I think they understand some things that we don't.  They have to in order to survive.  But we, that, that--I have questions about that (laughter).

Speaker 1: Is that one of your biggest concerns about the black community as such is--
Speaker 2: I think the biggest concern right now I have about the black community--I've, I've kind of sold off on--I let that go.  I mean I'm not saying I let it go, I don't--it's part of my need anymore.  But one of my needs, and what I am most concerned in the black community is that it is willing to allow its culture to be destroyed.  That troubles me, it troubles me.  I think of my ancestors.  I think of, of [W.E.B.] DuBois, I think of Malcolm [X].  I think of all these incredible people, how painful their spirit must be in the ether, to look down upon us and see how we have allowed our culture to be destroyed by ourselves, the lack of respect for the four hundred years of slavery.  And we ain't been free but, how many years?  Passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to now, ain't a lot of time (laughter).  That is not a lot of time.
Speaker 1: A hundred fiftieth anniversary.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Ain't a lot of time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We were slaves how long?  Four hundred years.  So we can just discard that four hundred years and just say, oh, that is of no consequence.  We don't have to pay any allegiance to the souls that suffered in the Middle Passage.  We can make, you know, dolls, slave dolls and sell 'em for commerce.  We can do, we can let anybody tell our stories and say what they want.  We can act like fools.  We can, we can destroy our culture because it means nothing.  This is a new beige world.  This is a world where there is no race.  We can forget that.  That troubles me a great deal.  That will trouble me the rest of my life.  Culture is important to me.

Speaker 1: Once again, when you look back over everything you've done to this point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what today would you consider your major accomplishments, or your legacy?
Speaker 2: You know, it's--I have to break that up in two: personal and, and career.  Personally, I think my legacy is my relationship with my children, which I prize.  I know so many adults who have horrible relationships with their children.  I mean my kids are grown, but still, I pride on that because we worked hard.  They versus, and, and myself, we worked hard on arriving at a relationship that we have now.  I adore the relationship.  I love 'em dearly, but I also just like the relationship.  I have it with them that, that we can interact and travel together.  And I like 'em.  That is really a prize, to love your children, to have an honorable son, to have a loving daughter and not to mention great-grandkids, two sons, I might say.  What I call my bonus son 'cause, you know, he's not blood, but he's like, God gave me a bonus.  So that is one of my greatest accomplishments as a human being.  Career-wise, I always--people ask me, I always say, I haven't had it yet.  But I got--I have to say that when I look back in television, it would be KR--I mean 'Frank's Place.'  In film, it would be 'When We Were Colored' ['Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored'], documentaries.  I'm doing a lot, but I think those are the two creative ones.  It troubles me a little bit that they are so dated and that I have not done anything to rival that.  However, I feel creatively as strong now as I did back then.  I'm sort of reenergized, thanks to these emerging filmmakers I've been working with.  And I also like to--I've discovered art and sculpting and photography.  I'm getting ready to publish a book called 'Dream Chaser: The Life and Times of Tim Reid,' [Tim Reid] in prose, poetry and photography.  The book will be out within a month, and I'm very proud of that 'cause it's, it's, it's a sort of, you know, I got a lot of interests and they seem to all merge together into this book, the photography, the poetry, the prose and essays.  And then I'm gonna start a one-man show later this year.  And so, I mean creatively, I'm, I'm kicking into another gear.  I don't know where it'll go, but I'm kicking into another gear.  And I love traveling.  Man, gosh, I'm having so much fun traveling.
Story_ID: 292627
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your children.  We, you've alluded to 'em--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, my son [Timothy Reid II], the eldest, forty-six, outstanding young man.  I, I say this in all honor and respect to him.  He's the man I had hoped to be, character and just a wonderful, wonderful son, has had some very difficult times.  I, I've seen him marshal the sixth power and to go through his pain in a way that, with the character and I was like, wow.  And I really, I really admire him.  My, my other son [Christopher Tubbs], we had become very close, and we didn't like each other, but we built our relationship on respect.  And one of the wisest things I ever said to anybody was to him when I said, one day when I brought him to live with me--he was having some trouble in Chicago [Illinois].  And his mother [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid] was worried, and I said, "Bring him to live with me."  She said, "Are you offering that?" 'cause she knew I didn't like him.  And he didn't like me.  And it was okay.  I didn't really care to like him.  He wasn't the kind of the kid that I liked, didn't like his attitude or anything about him really.  But, excuse me, I knew that if I was gonna be living with his mother, married to her that if I didn't help him and bring him, it was gonna be a problem for us in the future.  So I say, "You bring him.  We'll work it out."  So we brought him to live with us.  And the first day there, even he was like, "You're letting me--what's this about?"  So I pull him in the room, and I says, "let me tell you something right now.  I don't like you, and you don't like me.  And that's all right.  I'm not your father.  You have a father.  And that's all right.  We don't have to love one another."  And he looked at me.  I said, "We don't have to love no one.  No one says you have to love--this is what we have to do.  We have to respect one another.  I'll respect you and you'll respect me.  This room right here is your room.  That door, anything cross that door is yours.  Everything out here belongs to me.  I rule out here.  That's your rule, and we will respect one another.  That's all I ask."  We shook on it, and from that we built a love and a, and a relationship that's one of the best I've ever had in my lifetime.  And he taught that, you know.  I think we taught each other that, that that's possible.  And I, I did.

Speaker 1: My daughter [Tori Reid] is my heart.  I mean I almost lost her when she was four years old.  She fell off a two-story balcony and was out.  And I remember driving her to emergency room 'cause race--they wouldn't, they wouldn't send paramedics to pick her up, where we lived.  And I was just so angry.  So we, we had a, a doctor, an Asian doctor down--wrapped her in a, in a cookie plate 'cause she was--they were afraid to lift her, wrapped her in a cookie plate.  And I put her in the back of my car, and my first wife [Rita Reid] was holding her.  I did a hundred miles an hour to get to the emergency room.  Police was coming.  Somebody had called the police, and they come by me and saw me and turned around and, and when they knew what was happening, they got ahead of me, and we went through and got to the hospital and took her in.  She was out for quite a while, and we didn't know if she was gonna make it.  I actually remember, I mean praying and praying and all that.  And she survived, and I remember saying--thinking to myself, this is a gift.  I really don't care about all the things that a parent should care about.  I care that she's alive.  This is a gift.  I will love her the rest of my life and cherish this gift.  And so, because of that she--we, we have a different kind of relationship.  It's not that she can't do any wrong or anything like that.  It's that she doesn't have to prove anything to me 'cause every day she's there is a bonus to me.  And so I have a, I have a very different kind of relationship with my daughter.  And I think people understand that between she and I.  And so we have a different, different relationship, but she is my gift.  Yeah, and now, I got grandkids who I love and are very unique and different, and (laughter) I bless--only child, for a kid, grew up poor like myself and only child, never had anybody around me ever until--I mean I never sat down at a dinner table with a family 'cause I didn't--I came from a broken--bastard child and all that.  To have this kind of family now is a great reward, and, shoos, you kidding me?  I mean I was, yeah, this is great, you know, to go visit your kids and your grandkids and all that.  It's just, that's why I say, it's not been a--it's not been things the way, go the way I would have liked in many ways, but I look at the, the personal side of my life and the love that I have.  And I look at the career side of my life, and the things that I would have liked to have had.  Who wouldn't of wanted a film career or this or make millions.  Oh, yeah, sure.  But I know so many people, when you look at the balance, I got no complaints, you know.  It's, it's, life has been very just to me, above just, as [Bill] Cosby, my friend Cosby says, "I'm in the bonus round."  You know, and then I, I get cancer, and I, I'm blessed to, to give an extended life on that, you know.  It could have been curtains.  So I got some financial issues with a studio [New Millennium Studios, Petersburg, Virginia].  Who cares?  (Laughter).

Speaker 1: Now, a lot of people really admire your relationship with [HistoryMaker] Daphne [Maxwell Reid].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which is something that, it's, you know, they often think of you both together, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, she--we've been together now thirty years.  Boy, I don't know how we've done it.  It, it--I tell you, I know why, why I, I stay.  You'd have to ask her why she stays.  Certainly, I've challenged her.  I stay because Daphne is very bright.  I mean she's one of the Mensa people and IQ off the chart and all that kind of stuff.  But she's bright in how to, to deal with me.  She knows my past, she knows a little bit about me.  She knows--I adore women, I adore women, because I was raised by women, always just surrounded--it's like the thing, I was raised by wolves (laughter).  I was raised by the dominant female, you know.  I'm like a lion pride, you know, I was raised by these incredible hunters and gatherers who happened to be women.  So I like strong women, and I like being around women, friends and stuff.  I don't mean necessarily in a romantic way at all.  But I mean I just like the company of women, and she understood that early on.  And I don't mean flirting.  I just mean I like--I'm comfortable around women, and I, and I, you know, and she knows that.  And she early on, allowed me the freedom, and in allowing me the freedom of being able to express that made me comfortable with it.  So I didn't--it never became a part of our problem.  She also lets me--she knows that I'm, I'm an introvert with extrovert tendencies.  And so, when I feel the need to be alone, you know, I go to my man cave in California or I say, "I'm going to--I gotta go to--I'll see you.  I'm going to Africa.  I'm going to Brazil.  I'm going--I gotta get outta here."  "Okay, see ya".  Or she'll say, "I wanna go" or, "No, I'll see ya."  You know, so I have that freedom.  You know, I remember I tell friends sometime, I say, where they're going?  I say, I'm going to Brazil.  And they go, "Your wife lets you go to Brazil."  I don't know how to answer that.  I'm going, "Huh?  Uh, yeah," (laughter).  I mean how do you answer that?  Your wife lets you go to Brazil?  Yeah, why couldn't I go to Brazil?  What is she afraid that I'm gonna do and that I can't do here?  (Laughter) You know, so I never had that question--I never had to think I wanna go--Oh, I can't go.  I wonder if Daphne'll let me go.  It was never any issue, and the same thing for her.  If she wants to go--and she goes off and do her thing.  So that helped us, I think, a lot.  So I've been very fortunate to, to be with someone understood some of my weaknesses and strengths and did not try to--yeah, in the beginning we tried to change each other, but we gave on that.  God, that was like hitting your head against a wall.  So I think she's comfortable with it, or if she isn't comfortable with it, she's, she is wise enough to play it in a way that makes me think, hey, this woman is somebody that understands me in a way that I need to be understood in order to function.  So, I think that has a lot to do with it, and you'd have to ask her on her side, but that's my side of it.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I think you, boy, these two interviews.  I can't think of anything that you haven't asked me.  No, I can't think of anything, so I'll--scream it out (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  The last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know, I think--I don't even have to answer that.  I think I will be.  The people who know me--I, I will be remembered as a dreamer.  I mean, and [HistoryMaker] Daphne [Maxwell Reid] will tell you, and she, she'll probably speak at my funeral and say this, There is seldom a morning goes by that I don't wake up and say, "I got an idea."  You know, she used to always say, my friends used to always say, "You know, you should open up an idea shop, just a shop that says, ideas," and you come in, and you say what, what's your--what do you need?  And you tell me what it is, and I got, I got an idea (laughter).  I'm a dreamer.
