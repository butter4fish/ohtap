 Gill and today is November 6, 2008. I   m visiting with  Dr. Patrick Morgan in his home in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview  is for the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. Dr. Morgan, thank you for taking time to visit with  us today.  You   re quite welcome.  Would you start with a little bit of your pre-OSU story, a little bit about  where you grew up, about your career before you got to Oklahoma State  University.  Sure. I was born and raised in Florida until I was about 18 years old and  then went off to school; first to Dartmouth and then back to Florida State  and then the University of Georgia where I received the DVM degree.  Shortly after that, I worked for USDA for four years, then received a  master   s of public health degree from Tulane University. Went into the  Army for two years, went back to Tulane and was a graduate student for  the doctor of public health degree, then joined the faculty and  administration there for about seven years.  From there I came to Oklahoma in 1972. A man that I had worked with  in El Salvador became Commissioner of Health here in Oklahoma and  he asked me if I would like to come and work with him here. I wasn   t  unhappy where I was, but Barbara and I sat down together and put  together some conditions that frankly I didn   t think would ever be met.  A month went by and I didn   t hear anything and two months went by  and we both said,    Well that   s the end of that.    The third month came  and the commissioner said,    It   s all worked out. When can you start?    I  came here primarily with an appointment with the State Health  Department, but also had paying part-time faculty appointments at OSU  College of Veterinary Medicine and at the OU College of Public Health.  5  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  You worked with epidemiologists and worked with human and animal  health care.  That   s correct.  What were some of your primary responsibilities? What did your typical  job responsibilities include?  When I was with the State Health Department, I made three changes  rather rapidly. First I was their so-called    Public Health Veterinarian     and the department had never had a DVM on their staff before. So  anything that came up involving an animal particularly, if it was touchy  or gory or politically sensitive in any way, got funneled to me. Later I  became the state epidemiologist, and as far as just fun is concerned, that  was the most fun I   ve ever had in a job although, except for my Army  experiences, I   ve enjoyed most of the things I   ve done.  Your career path is a little bit different than many veterinarians.  Very atypical, but I think it   s an indication of all of the many things that  are open to DVMs, and  there are  more every day. Today DVMs are  assigned positions that they would not have been considered for even 20  years ago.  Being in public health as much as you were, did it help you with some of  your administrative responsibilities and your leadership roles later in  your career?  Oh absolutely. At one time with the State Health Department, I was  deputy commissioner for what they called    Personal Health Services.     The department essentially had people things and thing things and most  of the people things were ultimately my responsibility. I had to request,  justify, and then manage an annual budget of more than  50 million a  year.  You mentioned earlier that you were a visiting professor at Oklahoma  State. What courses were you teaching?  Actually two. One was in food safety and the other was in general  epidemiology and disease prevention and control.  Could you share a little bit about what circumstances led you to the  deanship position at Oklahoma State University?  I think so. As I said from the day I came, I had part-time teaching  assignments in both the College of Public Health in Oklahoma City and  6  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  here with the vet school, but I got to know Dean Bill Brock. I   d come  up   first it started out to be two days a week, but I   d come and talk for  two hours and go. Finally, they arranged it so I could come one day a  week and have two two-hour sessions and not have to travel back and  forth two days. Over the course of that I got to know Dean Brock quite  well. We visited a lot about both the commonality and the difference in  administrative problems and the state agency located in the capital and  academia just before he finally said,    I   ve been interim dean for seven  years now, enough is enough. I   m not going to do this anymore.     He stopped me one day and said he wanted to talk with me and asked if  I   d be interested in the position and would I mind if he submitted my  name. I said no, for a couple of reasons. One is it   s not the same as it  was, but at the time I was with the State Health Department, I had gotten  as far as I could go. By law the Commissioner of Health had to be a  physician   that has since changed, but at that time, I was at my plateau  and I   d always wanted to be in a position where I achieved what I  wanted to or failed on my own decisions and actions. And OSU Vet  School really is unique to a lot of things because we   re a line item in a  state university budget. The State Regents appropriate money directly to  the Veterinary School and so it   s not as if it goes to the general  university and then it   s parceled out.  What were your thoughts? What did you know about Oklahoma State  University College of Veterinary Medicine at that time? You said you  considered being in the deanship position. What did you know going in  about the school? What were your perceptions?  My first perception I think that I noticed the first time I visited the  campus here was that they did not have an animal disease diagnostic  laboratory. And I was astounded that a state such as Oklahoma that has a  very large animal industry for several species didn   t have one through  the college; its departments of microbiology and pathology did what  they could, but that wasn   t their primary mission. I was glad to see a  diagnostic laboratory established and you probably will remember  initially it was in the Department of Agriculture and that was the way     frankly it was a political maneuver to bypass the State Regents. So the  money was   you know how that goes, I don   t have to say anymore. And  later it was transferred to the college, so now it is an official part of the  college.  What do you remember about the interview process? Can you share a  little bit? Can you go back a few years and recall the interview process  and tell us a little bit about that?  When I interviewed with the Regents? Yes. Actually we went to the  7  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  hotel there at the Oklahoma City Airport. The Regents had flown in  there from different places around the state and I guess they (not to say  anything negative about the others) but the most charismatic and  dynamic fellow in the room was a huge man named John Montgomery, a  veterinarian who spent many years in Poteau , Oklahoma . And not only  was he my ultimate boss as the chairman of the Board of Regents, twice  while I was here, but he also became a very close friend.  Was he a practicing veterinarian?  And a practicing veterinarian. The others, there was a newspaper man, a  fellow who was a large sheep producer, somebody from the beef-cattle  industry and frankly, I don   t remember much, but I do remember that  and I thought it went well. They were very direct, didn   t beat around the  bush and made it clear to me that the primary problem I would be facing,  they expected to see solved should I be offered the job and take it, was  the matter of accreditation for the college. It   s not known and it makes  one wonder really what accreditation means in this instance because  OSU for a long, long time has been producing national and world  renowned graduates, but at that point in time they had never ever had  full academic accreditation.  Could you explain to us the American Veterinary Association  accreditation?  Yes, the veterinary profession is the professional organization; the  AVMA is in fact a professional union. That   s to protect and enhance the  benefits of the members of the profession and I think that   s well and  good. However, I have had questions in my mind a long time that a  profession would regulate the academic institutions that produced that  particular clinical person. Physicians don   t do it, dentists don   t do it, I  don   t think any of the other health professions do, but nevertheless that   s  the way it was and that   s the way it still is, so we had to work within that  framework.  If I could give you a little background here from before I got involved  directly, but I knew about it. There   s a   it   s called a Council of  Education in the AVMA hierarchy. These are not staff people; there is a  senior staff person, but  council members are  elected by the delegates  of AVMA. They had come to OSU, had a site visit, made the decision  that the college was on, quote    Confidential Probation.    Now when a  minimum of 50 people know something, it   s not going to be confidential  very long and, of course, it wasn   t. It hit the newspapers and there was a  big splash,    Oh, we   re going to close the college    or    Well I   ll be it,  we   ll get a license in another state.     8  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  The group went down to visit Dr. E.T. Dunlap, who was Chairman of  the State Regents of Higher Education and essentially the number one  person in education in the state; a very memorable person, in my mind  anyway. The first thing   I was told this by one of the men that were  there and I have no reason to disbelieve him. But he said the first thing,  E.T. made them wait 20 minutes past their appointed time. And then  they came in and he already knew, he   d received a letter about this     Confidential Probation    etc. And he said,    Before we get too involved  in this, let me tell you this, should you attempt to continue this probation  or make any other serious charges about the university, I   ll have a  federal injunction against you before you can get back to Schaumburg,  Illinois. Now, let   s talk.    And we went from there.  But nevertheless, our primary problem was lack of facilities. We did not  have a teaching hospital in any sense of the word that would suffice. I  think the one we  now  have here is quite nice. It   s modest by national  standards. As an alumnus of the University of Georgia, I recently  received notice that they are building a new  small animal section of  their  teaching hospital at an estimated cost of  50 million in today   s  dollars. Now by the time it gets built, who knows what that will actually  be. That   s a big item. But we have a teaching hospital now that   s a good  one. It constantly needs maintenance and new equipment and things like  that, but we   re in good shape there.  You mentioned when you got here the challenges that you faced; were  there some other things? You said the deanship position, that followed a  little bit of your vision of where you wanted to take the college, first of  all. What were your challenges? Accreditation was obviously one of  them.  Well, accreditation superseded anything else, but there were subsets that  had to be achieved before that could be achieved and some of the things  I found    Bill Brock was very good in briefing me on what I could  expect of   the warts as well as the halos   and he was very direct and  told me some things I would be facing and that   s good. You don   t want  to discover those things after the fact.  No surprises.  But as an example, no professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine  had ever been denied tenure. Remarkable. Ever. If they stayed here long  enough, they got tenure. And that bothered me, because you deal with  hundreds of people over time. It   s just a certainty that you   re going to  meet some people that you don   t want to make a lifetime commitment  to. So, I think it   s safe to say in a lot of quarters, I was not a popular  dean, but that wasn   t the job I had been given. My job was to get the  9  Gill  Morgan  college improved, to recruit the kind of faculty we needed as much as  possible, and encourage the others to find someplace else to go. And  with that, we took off recruiting. Barbara and I were still living in  Edmond. At one time, we entertained prospective faculty or  administrators 14 nights in a row. And at that time, the Ancestor   restaurant  and the Holiday Inn and the Student Union were the only  three places you could take people to dinner. So we got to know the  people at the Ancestor very well.  Recruiting Dr. Mack Oyler as  Associate Dean, and Dr. Louie Stratton as Director of the teaching  hospital were most important.   As I say, the other big problems  you have are when  you get down to  money. The school simply was not funded well enough to hire the kinds  of people we needed, to keep up the repairs and do the sort of things we  needed to do. Dean Brock told me that he felt (and I felt) that the  relationship between the college and the faculty was not as good as it  could be with the alumni and the practicing veterinarians in the state. I  found that to be true and that was one of the primary things that I tried to  work on. So I think it   s safe to say that when you set goals for yourself,  the closer you get to achieving them, the harder the next increment is. If  you get to 70 percent, it   s a lot harder to get to 80 than it was to get from  60 to 70, and that prevailed. That was expected and I was not at all  surprised. Having come from a university, Tulane Medical Center, that  was strictly private and that was totally dependent on contributions,  endowed funds and tuition for their total income, I was accustomed to  having to hustle for out-of-state money or off-campus money, if you  will.  Another surprise to me was that the College of Veterinary Medicine had  never entered a private grant application with any foundation, ever. And  with a lot of help from a number of people, Bob Wood, Louie Stratton,  of course, Don Holmes   people in the business office, Marilyn Wilson,  Dorothy Scarborough, we put together an application to the Sarkeys  Foundation and were awarded  195,000. So that was a start and that has  perpetuated itself as you know and to a lot of     That private fundraising in individuals, had you done any of that in the  college?  Yes. We started out that in an attempt to get a better relationship with  the alumni. About the one place where people from all over and not just  in the state, but graduates who were practicing in Boston or California or  wherever, would congregate was at the annual AVMA Convention. The  first convention that we had after I came here was in Dallas and I had  talked to other people and they had said that these alumni gatherings at  the AVMA had previously been peanuts and pretzels and a cash bar and  10  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  soft drinks. I decided that that would be a good test to see what we could  do. At the time, I received a good bit of criticism for the amount of  money that we spent on that gathering. It was nice, it was very nice. We  had a beautiful ice sculpture of Pegasus, the horse of mythology, on the  table and the best hors d   oeuvres the hotel could prepare. I had several  people come up and say negative things about wasting money on that.  But as I had thought and had predicted, I had checks or money in my  pocket that would pay for the thing twice over before I left the room. So  the people were proud, they were going around to the other gatherings  and saying,    Hey, you want to see how a school does it right? Come on  over to our place and let us show you.    So I feel that if you   re going to  ask people to commit themselves, you need to commit something to  them.  What was your vision of where you wanted the college to go, and could  you share some specific goals you had in mind for the college?  I wrote these down about 28 years ago and I   m not sure how I can  remember them except in general terms, but I did feel that our research  efforts were not what they should be, and that again goes back to  funding. I felt that graduate education was not what it should be and up  until I guess    79 or    80, the College of Veterinary Medicine had never  received direct funding for graduate education. It was based entirely on  the number of DVMs produced and indirectly we had to beg money or  borrow people from the College of Agriculture and the College of Arts  and Sciences to teach particular courses. But with Vice President James  Boggs    assistance that changed and we began to get a direct allocation  for graduate education and began to have more interns and residents and  clinical specialties. Those didn   t come overnight, but they progressed  well and I was happy with the way things were going.  So one of your goals was graduate education and research. A couple of  others you might have had?  It was then and it still should be. The reason that the college exists is to  produce well qualified DVMs. That   s number one, it has been and it  should be. In the recent years throughout the country, there   s been an  emphasis on research to the extent that in some universities, I think the  DVM program is second or perhaps third priority and I hope we never  shift that way. We should have a strong, good research program but not  at the expense of the clinical degree.  I understand that you were instrumental in helping fund the David L.  Boren Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital and helping ensure its  completion and it was already in transition when you got there. Can you  tell me a little bit about the process of getting final approval and  11  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  funding?  Yes. The idea for a teaching hospital, which was a primary goal at that  time, had been considered a year or so before I ever came up here. In  fact, then Senator Gene Stipe had submitted a bill requesting that, but it  did not pass. So the idea was approved in principle, but there wasn   t any  money. The problem there, as you know in Oklahoma, we can   t go into  deficit spending. If we   ve got something, that say, is going to cost  9  million   which was the estimate at that time for the teaching hospital     if you get  3 million this year, you can   t write a contract for  9 million,  you can only write a contract for three. So you stand the risk if you get  three this year, three next year, and then three, of having three primary  contractors. And I could see that as an absolute nightmare.  So we took the position that we were going to wait until we had all of  the money before we went out for contract bids. David Boren was then  Governor, he had been Governor, I think that was his last year in office  and he came in, you may remember Jerry, on a program of budget  accountability. No new state construction until all of the needed repairs  were done; he made one exception and that exception was the teaching  hospital. That was the first major building that had been built on this  campus in the previous ten years and along with President  Lawrence L.   Boger, then Senator Bob Murphy, and Vice President Dick Poole, I was  in the governor   s office when he said,    I don   t know how I   m going to  do it, but before I leave office, I will somehow get the remaining  3  million you need earmarked for the college.    And he did. There have  been allegations that this was a quid pro quo deal that if he   you   ve  probably heard those rumors.  That was my next question. (Laughter)  If I get the money for you, will you name the hospital after me? I can  assure you that did not happen. However, the OSU Regents, in  appreciation for what he did, going against initially what he said his  commitment was going to be, because he saw it as a distinct need, the  Regents decided to name it the Boren Veterinary Medical Teaching  Hospital. There was a lot of yelling back and forth. As you probably  remember Dan Draper was Speaker of the House then, and Senator Bob  Murphy was Chairman of the Higher Education Appropriations  Committee for the Senate and they were not friendly with David Boren.  In fact, both of them boycotted the dedication ceremony. They called  me, personally, and said,    We   re not mad at you, we   re not mad at the  school. We just don   t agree with a lot of the things Governor Boren has  done. So you won   t see us there.     But the night before the dedication ceremonies, the name Boren was not  12  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  on the building. This is not known to many people. There are a lot of  them that knew it that are deceased or have moved on. But I received a  direct order, if you will, from the then Chairman of the OSU Board of  Regents that it was a mandate that we get the letters on the building  before the ceremony. And they were put on there about 2:30 AM as I  recall. They   d been ordered, but they were still in the box. That was an  interesting time. It really was.  I was going to laugh, of course now it   s President David Boren, there  was an alumni disenchantment over that and there was a follow up a few  years later.  And now the younger faculty, they have no reason to know what  transpired and I still say even beyond that, David Boren has been a  friend of that college.  And that was the decision of our OSU Board of Regents?  Yes. I know it was.  And there were some of them that said,    Well, he appointed them to the  Board of Regents, too.    A lot of interesting sidelights on that, but let   s  move on     But it did clarify one thing, I thought I already knew it, but I was told,     Remember in your position, you may report to other people, but  ultimately you   re responsible to the Board of Regents and this is what  you   re going to do.    I didn   t have any argument with it. I wanted to see  it done, but nevertheless, it wasn   t a debatable issue with me.  Did President Boger have a position on it that you knew of?  He never stated one to me.  Getting the veterinary teaching hospital was quite a long time dream.  Why was it so important to the college?  There were two   one direct and one indirect. The direct one was that we  had facilities then that could provide the kinds of services that the  animal owners, both commercially and pets, should have had and could  only have if you have the proper facilities and equipment. Beyond that,  without those sorts of facilities, regardless of what else we did, we  would not have ever received academic accreditation. So it was a  twofold thing. It was something that should have been done whether the  accreditation was a problem or not. But the two went hand-in-hand to  me and I   d like to say that anyone who   s ever been directly involved in  13  building a 3500 square foot home can multiply that to building a  143,000 net square feet building and let me tell you, it was a real  learning experience for me. We were very fortunate to have available a  man who had been a working partner in a construction firm before he  went to veterinary school, Bob Wood. And he ran the interference with  the contractors, with the architects, and with our university architects.  I don   t know how much time you have for war stories, but I   ll just tell  you two. Before the building was started, people from the faculty went  around to different schools that had recently built teaching hospitals to  find out if they had to do it over again, what they would do or what they  would not do. One of the things that they found out readily was there are  very few architects that have ever built a large animal hospital. A big  hospital   not one just for large animals. They tried to use human codes,  those that would be used in human hospitals. A hundred pounds of  animal feces is different from a hundred pounds of human feces. And  you need to have your drains much, much bigger and we knew that. We  actually had those modifications put on the drawings. They were  modified. The change ordered that even though we had said before it  was approved, you need to make these changes, they were ignored. Dr.  Wood came in my office one day and said,    There are forty Dolese  cement trucks out there ready to pour the foundation and the largest  drain they have is four inches and most of them are two.    I said,    Send  them home because there   s no point in pouring it and six months from  now having to tear it up.    Which was what had happened at Texas A M  about three years before that. That little hoorah cost  our CVM   40,000.  You may have noticed on the teaching hospital, there are large slabs of  reinforced concrete marble rock covered that they   d just pick up and put  into place. The tolerances on those were plus or minus an inch and a half  thickness and if you stood at one end of it and looked down, you could  see, or I thought I could see, that they weren   t within those constraints.  So the construction foreman, I had talked with him, and he said,    Oh,  that   s an optical illusion. You know how you look at a railroad track and  it comes together down in the distance, that   s the same sort of thing.     And he said,    Besides that, there   s no way we could measure without  drilling holes in it.    Well, Bob Wood poked me and we just left it at that,  and we walked away and he says,    He   s lying to you and he knows it.  They do that with X-Rays. I   ll get you the name of two firms that do it.     So the next day I went back and saw him and said,    You can get the X-Rays  done at either one of these two businesses and we   re not going to  pay for this until we   re sure you   re within tolerance.    So they had to  remove one or two of the panels, not the whole thing, but once they  knew it was going to be checked, they paid more attention to what they  were doing. And there were some other things that were really funny in  retrospect, but it was something every day.  14  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  You got to know the architects and the construction companies very well  then.  Like a duck, I woke up into a new world every day. (Laughter)  Getting into the third part of it, I guess it was important to the clinical  training of students as well?  Absolutely. We just didn   t have the appropriate facilities to do some of  the things we needed to do. And just by having good, dedicated  teachers    Lester Johnson is a key example in equine medicine and we  had several in the others, Ralph Buckner in small animal and I could  name many more and it was through their dedication and willingness to  work 60 or 70 hour weeks many times and not expect extra  compensation because they believed in what they were doing.  You touched on something that when I visit with people about the  college, there   s that sense of commitment and passion that the faculty  have. And OSU   s College of Veterinary Medicine faculty has always  been known as a teaching faculty. You mentioned earlier that research is  extremely important, but not at the expense of basic teaching and  clinicians. Can you expand on that a little bit, how you feel about the  teaching role at the college while you were there?  Sure, I don   t mind talking about that because it   s one of the things I get  on a soap box about. It   s amazing what you can do with a group of  students who want to learn and somebody that can speak and draw even  some crude things on a chalk board and show them and perhaps have  some models and finally get to live animals to show them how to do  different things. Through that mechanism, we turned out a lot of good  people. Now, Oklahoma State for a long time was known as a quote     Practitioner   s School,    that is when the students walked out at the end  of graduation with their diplomas, they were ready to go to work. They  didn   t have to go work with somebody for a year or two or three before  they could do a decent job. As with anything, the more experience you  have, the better you get at it.  But there were other schools, which will remain nameless, some of their  graduates tell me that when they got their diploma, they had never  performed one surgical procedure. They had to learn on their client   s  animals after they got out of school. And I frankly think that   s unethical.  These people before they work on your animal, before they work on my  animal, I want them to have had some experience. And that   s getting  harder and harder to do because of some people   s belief that a dog or a  cat or a sheep, their life is just as important as a human and I simply  don   t believe that and I think a lot of people don   t believe that. We   re all  15  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  committed to treating animals humanely, but animals are subservient to  people, in my opinion, and there are those who would argue me to death  on that point. But that   s the way I feel and if we are ever forced to get  away from using teaching animals, we   ll be in trouble.  You mentioned earlier Dr. Lester Johnson and some others. Could you  maybe comment on some of the teachers you thought were highly  respected and did a great job during your time and before and after,  also?  Yes, sure and one of the things that I would want to get into this was  that, for whatever reasons, we in academia tend to take people who are  good teachers and put them in administrative roles for which they   re not  really qualified, they don   t really want it, but that   s the only way they   re  going to get promoted or get a salary increase.  Principle of action?  Absolutely. So I would say, not just here, but at Kansas State, Fayne  Oberst was known as an excellent classroom teacher. I think he did a  good job there and I think he could have done a good job here. I could  name many others. Bob Smith who is still around as a consultant in the  beef-cattle industry was very good at herd health management and  working with students and sharing with them what to do. Tom Monin for  many years was an excellent equine surgeon, eventually his eyesight  forced him out of the active role, but he was there for a lot of years and  he taught a lot of people. Dr. Lawrence E. Evans, you may remember  Lawrence E., he could have passed as a double for William Conrad in   the TV shows  Jake and the Fat Man and Cannon and he was a rough  old boy, but he taught a lot of people a lot of radiology. Those are just a  few of those that I remember.  There are some basic science professors  that I would be remiss if I did not mention. Drs. Dwight Peterson and  Jonathan Friend spent their entire professional careers teaching anatomy  to OSU students. In addition to his professional specialty of pultry  pathology Dr. Al Malle taught much, much more to decades of  veterinary students. During the academic year of 2008-09 Dr. James  Breazile taught his 50th class of veterinary students. Upon Dr. Home   s  retirement he also served as college and university Laboratory Animal  Veterinarian for ten years.   What are some of the curricular changes and clinical practice changes  in methodology when you were there as dean? Can you recall some  things, some innovations that you put in place?  Well, I wouldn   t call them my innovations, but there was a serious  discussion as to allocation of resources and various things. One of those,  16  Gill  Morgan  as I mentioned previously I think, was graduate education and post  graduate clinical training in internships and residencies. And that  happened. If there was one major thing that I think transpired, the  curriculum was adjusted to account for those things. As a specific  example, there had never been a course taught on laboratory animal  medicine and when we think about it, every prescription drug that you  and I take or have taken during our lifetime was first tested on one  species of animal or more. And yet, we weren   t preparing our students  even marginally to deal with these things.  So in convincing Don Holmes, who is an OSU alumnus, to leave the OU  Health Science Center and come up here as Director of Laboratory  Animal Medicine, not only did he play a teaching role, but he also  provided a service as the university laboratorial animal veterinarian to  see that any research project using animals was done properly and  according to law. Sometimes the researchers mean to do well and for the  most part do, but there may be some aspect of federal law which  essentially means, if you take our federal dollars, you   ll play by our  rules. And Don was very good in what he saw of deviation from that,  pointing out that if they were going to continue to get federal funds, they  would have to make these modifications. And people did. There were  very few who got angry about it. They just thought they were doing  okay and didn   t know better.  And I might say that Don, while he was here, wrote a textbook because  at that time, you   d have a book on subjects, on primates, you   d have a  book on rats and mice, you   d have a book on rabbits. But there wasn   t a  comprehensive text that at least hit the high points of most of the lab  animal species. Don wrote that and published it and it is now used  around the country.  Any other curricular changes or any other clinical practice changes that  you recall during your tenure?  The initiation of preceptorships or externships or whatever you want to  call them, where our students would spend a certain period of time  before they graduated working with a private practitioner. Hopefully,  those that wanted to go into cattle practice would work with a cattle  practitioner and those that wanted some other area would work there.  And once again here, Lester Johnson was the person who was so well-respected  around the state that he could visit these practices to make sure  the students weren   t picking up bad habits. Those were minimal, but  when we did discover that in rare instances, then we just didn   t continue  with that individual. But once again, that was a rare exception. But it did  take into things such as time management. Those of us that spend our  time in academia, our clocks are slowed down compared to what the  17  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  private practitioner does. For example, take 45 minutes or an hour to do  a simple spay on a cat and the practitioner is accustomed to doing a good  job skin to skin in no more than fifteen minutes, the perspective of the  student changes. Not only do they have to do it well, but they have to do  it well within a prescribed period of time. So I think that was a major  change.  You brought up an interesting point, Dr. Morgan, your relationship with  practitioners. That   s always important to the college. Can you talk about  relationships in your time there with practitioners, with alumni of the  college, some of the things that you did to invest and strengthen those  relationships?  Some of the things that evolved, in fact most of them, were ideas that  came from other people. I simply signed my name and pulled the trigger,  but they weren   t necessarily my ideas. But having spent    72-   77 with the  State Health Department, I already knew a lot of practitioners scattered  around the state because of my interactions with them with human health  related problems, brucellosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, rabies, of  course. At one time Oklahoma was one of the, this is not good, being in  the top three in number of cases of animal rabies is not good, as opposed  to BCS ratings. So we had a lot of things to do there.  I remember one episode, one of the practitioners in Pauls Valley was  convinced that deer were aborting their fetuses in the pasture and  contaminating his cattle. So, I picked up  an aborted fetus  and brought  it up here to school to get people here to say   it was early stages   was  it a cow fetus or was this a deer fetus. And we had two or three DVM  PhD   s there poking at it and looking at it and a fourth year DVM student  walked by and asked,    What are you doing Dr. Morgan?    I said,    Oh  these fellows are going to try and tell me whether this is a calf fetus or a  deer fetus.    And he says,    Oh that   s a calf fetus.    And just kept walking,  and of course, the professors were highly indignant and demanded to  know how he could take a glance at it and make that determination and  his reply was,    Deer don   t have long tails.    So sometimes we   re looking  for minutia and the obvious thing is right there in front of us. (Laughter)  But there were a lot of humorous things that happened along the way.  Did you have any engaging activities where you brought practitioners,  alumni back to strengthen those relationships?  Oh yes. Once again the idea of pinching pennies to take care of your  alumni is counterproductive. Bill Brock, bless his heart, had left me  enough money in the unrestricted foundation accounts that we could do  some things that we would have not been able to do and soon rather than   as an  obligation, people began to look forward to coming to alumni  18  Gill  Morgan  Gill  affairs, receptions at conventions, continuing education programs here,  Homecoming, that sort of thing; it was a pleasure, not an obligation. And  as a result, we got more and more referrals from those people when they  would send a case in and we tried to inculcate in every new faculty that  came on board. The older fellows here already understood that, by older,  I mean they weren   t new graduates. They had some miles on them.  Knew that when somebody sent you a referral, if you don   t get back to  them and tell them what you did and why, regardless of how bad you  might think they had done in their initial treatment. You don   t criticize  them in front of a client. You may call them and say,    Hey Joe, you  really missed it here.    But that is done private. And most of the time that  isn   t the case, but there   s a way to handle things like that and so we try  to inculcate things and for the most part, I think, did. We began to get  more and more referrals.  Going back on the terms of the focus on students, can you recall some  things in terms of the student experience that you all tweaked or  changed a little bit and created academic excellence, better graduates,  more prepared practitioners?  One of the aspects of selecting students that I believe in and a lot of  people don   t is the person with the 4.0 GPA may well not be your best  clinician; frequently they   re not, and may not be the best people person  because regardless of how good a clinician you may be, if the animal  owner doesn   t like you, he   s not going to keep bringing his animals to  you, unless he just has to. And very few have to go to just one place  anymore. So that was a consideration and in admissions, the  practitioners   I   m generalizing, but when you   ve got say 1500 people  and a hundred of them make a lot of noise on one particular point, it   s  noticeable. And there were complaints that we were only admitting  students that could make good grades, not those that were interested in  farm work or helping ranchers and farmers and whatever. I believe that  there should be a spectrum of people admitted, not just those with the  highest grades. They   ve got to be qualified or they   re not going to get  through the program. But whether a person, for example, has a 3.2 GPA  or a 3.6 GPA, I think there are other things involved in considering that  person. And consequently, we appointed a number of private  practitioners to the admissions committee and when the applicants came  for interviews, they would be paired off with a practitioner and a faculty  member. So the student didn   t just get one side of the picture during  their interview and also each student was interviewed twice. So you had  four people in the process, to level out any bias that anybody might have   towards  any one person.  Practitioners and professors both interviewed?  19  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Yes.  Anything in the student   s process going through the four year program  that you implemented?  I guess one thing that I initiated that I   m proud of is the first black  minority student fellowship for the college. It was started in the College  of Veterinary Medicine in honor of Dr. John Montgomery and it   s called  the John W. Montgomery Scholarship Fund. It was set up as an  endowment and I might say here that one of the things   and I   m going  to say    I    because I did here   that I emphasized and promoted is to use  funds in a way where you have an endowment, you just didn   t get a   100,000 gift and then spend a  100,000. You invested that  100,000  and spent your interest off of what came in there. And in that way, this  particularly starting out as a small scholarship has grown and grown and  grown. So there   s something I will get to later on about things I initiated,  but you may ask me about it so I   ll wait; if you don   t I   ll bring it up.  The emphasis on the research you mentioned earlier, what were some of  the areas of research, discoveries, procedures, that developed in your  time here in research areas?  Two that come to mind is research in tick-borne diseases, primarily  anaplasmosis in cattle and, of course, human diseases. Then in  respiratory disease in cattle what they call    Shipping Fever    and stress  related problems in other animals when they are transported from the  farms or the ranches to slaughter or from feed lot to slaughter. Stress  precipitates a lot of things that are not evident when they are simply on  pasture or in pens or whatever. Oklahoma State did have a patent on an  anaplasmosis vaccine developed largely by Bill Brock and Ginger Jones  and others, Jakie Hair worked with the Veterinary School, even though  he was in Entomology in the College of Agriculture. And subsequent to  that Dr. Kathy Kocan has done extremely well in tick-borne research.  She goes all over the world, giving lectures, learning from her  counterparts   in Africa, in Australia, in Israel   wherever. And she now  has a Regent   s Research Chair,  she is Regents Professor and Sitlington  Chair in Food Animal Research .  We were talking about several different expansions in the college when  you were there. What about in some of the areas such as administration,  some things in finance?  One of the things that were immediate cause for concern to me was the  untimely death of Bill Brock shortly after I came here full-time. And  then Ginger Jones, who was essentially manager of all of the federal and  research funds and our business manager, left to go to Mississippi State,  20  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  that was starting about that time. Then I was fortunate enough to hire  Marilyn Wilson who had a degree as an accountant but was working as a  secretary. But the point is, as they say, we learn by doing, so it was a  learning experience for her and for me. We made a trip to Washington to  visit Senator Bellmon about some federal funding at one time, but the  major thing I really enjoyed in the funding process was to have the right  or be granted the right to stand up before the State Regents  for Higher  Education  and tell people what good would happen if we received these  funds and what bad would happen if we did not receive these funds.  With Marilyn there to answer any of the fiscal related details or  questions, we faired very well in the percentage of increase in funds  from one year to the other. In fact, I would say we were always at least  in the top six or seven and frequently in the top two or three  of 32 line  items .  Percent of increase in revenue?  In the percentage of increase of state appropriated funds.  What do you attribute, Dr. Morgan, the case you were making it for, was  it good times financially from the state?  Both, the good financial times were just beginning, but I think the  primary thing was being able to communicate both from the sociological  scientific part as well as the fiscal part. Mrs. Wilson, in fact, it got to be  something I looked forward to. Most people dread going to things like  that, but we had some good people that would prep me as to what was  likely to come up and so and so and through the first two of these, we  began to get to know the assistant chancellor for finance and the  assistant chancellor for programs and early on I told them that   they   d  ask me a couple of questions that we really didn   t have time to complete  in the formal setting and I said,    Well can I spend a little time with you  here unofficially one day and come down and talk to you?    So we  arranged to do that and at that point in time, their idea of a DVM was  what most of the public think of. They   re a person that takes care of an  animal when it gets sick. And we know from experience that  approximately 30  of all DVM graduates spend the majority of their  professional careers in something other than fee for service private  practice.  So I made an appointment with the two deputy chancellors for the State  Regents. What started out to be a one hour appointment ended up lasting  more than three hours. The idea that veterinarians were involved in the  evolution of the drugs that they took for their high blood pressure was  something they never considered and the other things that veterinarians  were doing in the armed services, in industry, and all sorts of things. I  21  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  think the opening of their minds to the various aspects of our profession  did as much as anything to help us get the funding we needed.  Dr. Morgan, what about private fundraising and about grantsmanship?  These things increased also during your tenure?  Yes, they did. I think I mentioned the Sarkeys Foundation to you. That  was the first major foundation award that the college had ever received  and at that time,  195,000 was a pretty nice gift and it was strictly for  clinical equipment that we could not have afforded through state  appropriations. For example, we paid a company to develop a new  surgery table for working on large animals   bulls, big horses. It worked  on a hoist just like it does for a car when you take it in a shop, except  that it would rotate vertically or horizontally. You sedate the animal,  lean it up beside the table, strap it down, turn it horizontally and raise it  to whatever level you want. On both sides of it there were flaps that if  you had a 5   0       surgeon or a 6   6    surgeon you could adjust it to their  size. All of the contact areas were stainless steel. So we developed  something that before that time did not exist and we were able to do that  through the private money we got from Sarkeys.  Did you have a development officer at that time? You know, a fundraiser  officer?  We had one. Me. (Laughter)  Did you have to make some calls?  You bet. I like to make calls face to face. I don   t mind calling somebody  and saying,    Hey I want to talk to you about this. See if you can help us  out. Will you give me a time to come in?    It was interesting and these  people talked to one another and sometimes I would get a call from  people that had never before contributed to the college and those that I  knew better I would ask,    You   re very generous and we appreciate it.  Why don   t I have a record of your participating in these programs  before?    And the most common answer was,    Nobody asked me.     Surely there are some good stories there; can you share some of your  fundraising stories?  Well, this is a minor thing, but it   s a personal thing. You know, we tend  to inherit whatever furniture and fixtures and whatever is in the office of  the person that you replace. I think, by the time I got in there, it was  about fifth generation stuff in the dean   s office and Bill Brock being the  generous man that he was preferred to take what money he had and put  it elsewhere that he thought was more important. But I was talking to an  22  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  alumnus  Dan Woesner from Lawton  one day about providing some  funds to the college, specifically in scholarships in a given area, and he  said,    You know,    I won   t use his words (laughter) but he said,    If  you   re going to ask people for money, you shouldn   t do it in an office  that looks this crummy. You need to dress this up.    And I said,    Well, I  tried to at one time with some Foundation money, but it got  disapproved.    He said,    I   m going to send you a furniture catalog and  you pick out what you want to have here in the office, send it back to  me. I will buy it and have it brought to your office and installed.    And  he did. (Laughter) So here   s an instance when an alumnus was a little  ashamed of where his dean was working and wanted to improve it.  That   s just a small thing.  What was your biggest gift that you recall getting with fundraising?  From an individual, I don   t remember. There were a lot of, I won   t say  small, but modest contributions but they spread and you could see it.  You could see in an area, let   s say the southwestern part of the state, you  get one or two veterinarians contributing and they go to their local  meetings and they talked and the next thing you know, you   ve got  another one. One example I can think of is the Stephens County  Veterinarians (and I don   t remember who put this together) but they set  up an arrangement so that they did not charge for euthanizing any  animal. But they would tell the owner,    If you want to make a  contribution, it will go into a scholarship fund for DVM students at  OSU.    And it   s still in existence over the past 25 years, I couldn   t put a  figure on it, but I think that   s just one example of a small thing that over  time has turned out to be quite generous.  Can you recall any corporate gifts? You got the Sarkeys Foundation.  But can you recall gifts  from corporations  that you got in terms of  fundraising?  No I can   t, but there   s something different that I think is worthwhile to  mention here and that is a contract. Along about the time in the mid     70s, the numbers of veterinary schools in the U.S. was less than 20.  There were literally hundreds and hundreds of qualified students that  could not get admitted to veterinary schools anywhere in the U.S. So a  businessman by the name of Robert Ross, who had started a private  medical school in the Caribbean and had been quite a success, decided  that he would start a veterinary school.  He contacted three people   you may have known Bill Thurman when  he was provost to the OU Health Sciences Center. I had known Dr.  Thurman at Tulane before he came here. We maintained our friendship  and when Bob Ross said he was going to start a veterinary school, and  23  he asked him,    Can you recommend someone to advise me?    he gave  Dr. Ross my name, and then the Chief of Staff of the Animal Medical  Center in New York City is a very high profile person. That fellow and I  had become friends in the Army and had maintained friendships ever  since. And so Bob Ross called him and asked him if he   d be willing to  advise him and did he know of anybody that might be of assistance and  he gave my name to Bob, who called me and   these two people did not  know one another. (Laughter) So he said,    You may not know anything  about veterinary medicine, but you know a lot of people.    And there was  a third man appointed that had been president of the AVMA and in our  ultimate wisdom, since we knew more schools were being put on line,  we told Bob Ross that we didn   t think it would be financially viable to  do that. And he said,    Gentlemen, I   ve forgotten more about money than  you   ll ever know. Don   t worry about that. I   m going to build this school  whether you help me or not. I   d like for you to help me because I believe  that you know what you   re doing.    We decided if he   s going to do it  then we might as well advise him on how to do it right. The reaction to  this was rather astounding to me. There was a great deal of negative  attitude about it, you know, you   re selling out to the enemy. These  people are going to be our competitors. Blah blah blah. Today, there are  ten jobs for every graduate so any DVM that wants their work has got a  job.  But after the school was started, it wasn   t doing well because no private  school like that can afford a teaching hospital   even a  9 million one.  They just can   t do that. So Dr. Ross talked to me and said,    What about  writing a contract to the students that you   re willing to accept up to a  certain number we   ll send to OSU and they   ll go through clinical  rotations just like your students do. Whatever you require of OSU  students, you require of these students.    So I went and talked to the  University Attorney and I went and talked to President Boger and I was  concerned about somebody claiming conflict of interest and University  Attorney Charlie Drake said,    Well if anybody should be worried about  that, it should be Bob Ross. Because you know how much he can pay  and how much he will pay.    Which was true. (Laughter)  So we started a contract to take up to a certain number of students each  year, but we didn   t have to take a student if we didn   t like their record,  we didn   t have to take them. But that started out and I   d have to check  but the amount of money that has been brought into our college  over the  past 35 years  is millions. That was not a gift. It was a gift in a sense, I  mean, the faculty earns it. They teach the students, but also they get the  benefits of extra travel, some equipment, some other things that they  would not have were it not for that money and that is now a sizeable  portion of the college   s budget.  24  Gill  Morgan  What issues did you struggle with the most in your time at OSU?  The one I just mentioned was one of them. To my astonishment, the  basic sciences faculty screamed bloody murder that I had not conferred  with them before going ahead with this contract. And my thinking was,     They   re not going to have anything to do with these students, so why  should they care?    I had talked to the clinical faculty and many of them  had some reservations and my approach was,    Well, let   s do it for a year  and if it doesn   t work out, we don   t do it anymore.    And people who in  my mind had other axes to grind (as I told you before, I was not too  popular in some circles because I did deny tenure to a couple of people  fairly soon and I won   t go into the reasons why, but there was full  justification for it)  did so  to the point where they set up a fake  interview with the reporter for the Daily Oklahoman. I thought it was  kind of funny that he wanted to talk to me about something. I thought he  would want to talk to the Dean of Agriculture, but anyway he did. But  he brought in this investigative reporter Mike Hammer, I don   t know if  you   ve ever heard of him or not, but he was a rumor monger and his first  question was,    Just how much kick backs have you taken from Bob Ross  to initiate this thing?     Well that hit the front page of the Daily Oklahoman and fortunately one  of these alumni that I told you about that I had gotten to know was a  good personal friend of the managing editor of the Daily Oklahoman and  he called in and said,    What   s all this foolishness about?    and I told him  and he said,    Can you document that?    and I said,    Absolutely  I   ve got  this approved by the Board of Regents in advance, signed off on by the  University Attorney. Yeah, sure I can do that.    And he said,    Well what  do you want to do? Do you want to get a new car? Do you want us to  renovate your house or what?    And I said,    All I want is it stopped  because it   s not true.    And that was the end of it. Nothing was said any  more, but that was the extent to which some people would go because  they didn   t get their way.  Some people have a philosophy - management of a university should be  done by committee. I believe that committees should make  recommendations and the person responsible should make the decisions.  Most of the time you can and should take their recommendations, but  when you know it   s not correct, if you don   t do what you think is right  then you   re not earning your money. That had alienated a number of  people towards me and it   s no secret because it   s published in Eric  William   s book  A History of the Oklahoma State University College of  Veterinary Medicine . Five of the faculty went secretly, they thought, to  the president to ask him to remove me from office. And on this campus,  I knew they were there before they left. So it wasn   t a big surprise but it  was distracting, it was a negative effect. You know how it is. Anything  25  Gill  Morgan  bad you see in the paper, people tend to believe it first. But  nevertheless   and one of these guys, he was to retire in less than a year,  so naturally there was fallout from this and I was talking to him and I  said,    You   ve got less than a year to retire. Why on earth would you get  involved in something like that?    And ultimately his answer was,     Because you never asked me to go to lunch.    So what people will do  and their reasons they   ll do them I don   t know.  I think a part of this (what triggered it) was the termination of a tenured  full professor. I had been in Costa Rica and got in late the night before  and about 8 o   clock AM President Boger   s secretary  called my home  and  said,    The President wants you in his office in fifteen minutes.     And I said,    I can   t. I   ll be there as soon as I can.    I walk in and here is  the President, the Vice President, both University Attorneys, the Chief of  University, security, and I don   t have any idea why I   m there. Well to  cut to the chase, one of our faculty had been arrested while I was gone  and it ultimately led to his termination for    moral turpitude.    My role  was to recommend that an investigation be made to see if it was justified  to terminate this person and as that went through its process, including  appeal to the University Senate and to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,  it was all upheld, it was all done appropriately.  You may remember our little yellow book Appendix D told   administrators  how to do what they had to do. That was a sad thing,  but it was a necessary thing. So that was probably one of the most  difficult things that I had to do because passions were high and the  course of it   we took the position that we   re not going to do anything to  harm anyone anymore than we have to. In other words, we   re not going  to drag family or friends or whatever into this, this is an individual  situation. And it   s still been that way.  The record is  sealed and it  should be. But that was tough.  When you stepped down as Dean, you took your leave as a sabbatical  situation, but you came back and taught?  Yes, Barbara and I, in fact, went to St. Kitts in the Leeward Islands of  the Caribbean and I taught for a year at the Ross Veterinary School that  had been established there. About three weeks after we got there, the  dean got a telephone call that a job that he had been trying to get for the  past ten years and was now open and that if he could get there within  two weeks it was his, so he promptly left. And not wanting it, but there  not being anybody else around to do it, I told Bob Ross I would be an  interim dean for 90 days or until he got somebody else. Being the  businessman that he was, getting two for one, the new dean came in at  day 89. (Laughter) So then we came back here and I was very gratified.  The regents appointed me a Regents Service Professor and I stayed here  26  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  with the exception of about two and a half years under contract to the  State Health Department. You know how the intergovernmental  personnel act does and detail there, but they pay the University and the  University pays my salary, but other than that I came back here and  attempted to teach preventive medicine and public health courses until I  retired in 1995.  You had a long history with the University.  About 23 years  counting part-time service .  As you look back, what achievements and innovations at the college  during your time here gave you the most professional satisfaction and  personal drive?  On the big scale, of course, achieving full accreditation for the first time  in the history of the college has got to be number one. On a different  level, seeing students and young faculty develop from shy, reclusive  almost tongue-tied people when they get up in front of a group to very  polished, articulate people that are winning the Outstanding Teacher  Award three years out of five and others being nationally and  internationally recognized for their achievements. One of the few  students that showed an active interest in public health while he was still  a veterinary student just gave the keynote speech at the Fall conference  here. Larry Barrett is now the director of the Plum Island Quarantine  Station and Laboratory. You may remember Plum Island was mentioned  in Silence of the Lambs movie and was referred to as Anthrax Island.  Anthrax is one of the many things that they have on that place. Dr.  Barrett is an example; not while I was here, but prior to my coming here  Dr. Leroy Coggins developed the Coggins Test for horses that is used  worldwide for equine infectious anemia. There   s another gentleman  whose name I wish I could remember but I don   t who received the OSU  Hall of Fame Award. He later received a PhD, but his basic DVM  degree was obtained here. But he got a PhD and ended up as Director of  Research at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. So we have people going  everywhere.  Dr. Fidler?  Yes, yes. You   re right, Dr.  Isaiah  Fidler. I was on the stage when he  got the award but it has been some time.  He   s in the OSU Alumni Hall of Fame. We inducted him several years  ago. What generalized your 20 years here? You got a broad look at the  Veterinary Medicine profession and the college here. What significant  changes in development have you seen in the college over two decades?  27  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  Gill  Morgan  How has it changed and how is it moving in that direction?  It   s changed in one sense in that we went from a status of only taking  Oklahoma residents, which really didn   t work because a lot of people  would come here from other states and work for a year or two and  establish residencies, so their roots weren   t in Oklahoma, if you will.  And once we got by that stipulation from the state legislature, in theory  the legislature can   t directly affect what you do, but they can sure make  it hard when appropriations day comes around. (Laughter) But we   re  taking contract students from two or three different states, and they pay  out-of-state tuition, which is essentially double what in-state tuition is.  We don   t take many, but we do take a few. A small contract with New  Jersey. A small contract with Delaware and one other state   Arkansas, I  think. In fact, many of our alumni are from Arkansas or live in Arkansas  now, because for many years we had a large contingent of Arkansas  students. Another field, politically, I think in the past 12 years, three of  the AVMA Presidents have been OSU graduates.  American Veterinary Medicine Association?  Right.  Through the last 12 years?  Yeah.  Wow.  It might be 13 or 14 years, but certainly more than our share, if you will,  of graduates. And even though he   s a Kansas State graduate, Dr. Sam  Strahm of Pawhuska is certainly an honorary Okie because he spent his  entire professional career here since he got out of veterinary school.  How is the veterinary medicine profession changing?  I see two major changes. One is in the gender ratio of males and  females. Of course, when I went to school and in case you don   t know I  graduated 50 years ago, so I just went to my 50th graduation reunion  which was quite an experience to see people that you have literally not  seen or talked to in 50 years. But from going to less than one percent  female to 75 percent commonly, usually at least 60 percent at all the  schools around the country, that changes for lots of reasons. Some of  them I think are good for the profession and some aren   t good, but  nevertheless that   s the way it is.  The other big change is the evolution of large corporations owning  28  Gill  Morgan  multiple practices. There   s a group called Banfield that was started in  Banfield, Oregon and they now own something like 600  small animal   hospitals scattered around the United States and they are primarily  preventive medicine   I don   t want to call it minor surgery, but not  complicated surgery. They would do spays and neuters and a few other  things, of course, sew up lacerations on wounds. Thoracic surgery,  neurosurgery   they just don   t do that. But what they do is a high profit  part of the practice and they hire new graduates and essentially give  them a year   s experience at a reduced rate. The equivalent of an  internship, I guess. But what they do provide is benefits.  The sole private practitioner today, unless they have a certain number of  employees, it   s really hard pressed to get decent medical insurance. The  AVMA does a good job of what they can do, but new graduates are  looking more and more into benefits, be it medical, retirement,  whatever. And of course, that helps people like Banfield. Another group  is Veterinary Corporation of America. They   ve probably got about 350  hospitals scattered around the country, several in Oklahoma. And what  they usually do is they buy an established practice and will pay the  person they buy it from an agreed upon salary to stay there for a year  and sometimes considerably longer   a transition period. But at that  point the veterinarian doesn   t have to worry about hiring the kennel  help, keeping the roof repaired, seeing that the grounds are kept properly  and if you get 360 hospitals buying certain products, you get a much  better price than if you have one hospital buying at a certain price.  In your opinion, do you think it   s good or bad for the profession?  (Pauses) Let me put it this way, I think the mindset of the majority of the  graduates today is different from what it was 50 years ago. We never  have given much training in business management. We try now, but  when I went through school, there was literally nothing. The  veterinarians that have done well, a lot of them practice because they  turn out to be good business people. For those people who want to  simply do clinical medicine and not worry about any of these things,  they accept a set schedule for less money and less responsibility than if  they had their own practice and worked much harder and had much  more responsibility and I think that, I   m generalizing and it   s an opinion,  but I think that more of the graduates today prefer that scenario for a  career than they go alone.  However, there are a few very large one-entity specialty hospitals. The  one that immediately comes to mind is in New Jersey. They have more  than 60 specialists in that hospital. From everything from dermatology to  neurosurgery to opthalmology and on and on. And that is strictly referral  practice. I talked to one of my long term friends yesterday and he told  29  Gill  Morgan  me that his wife, who took over her father   s hospital in Pennsylvania,  now has four board certified surgeons on her staff and she   s gone in  partnership with another veterinarian down the street for a CAT scan  machine. The idea of a  private animal hospital  having a CAT scan  machine is pretty up there. Folks don   t realize it, but the cost   the  maintenance contract on a machine like that is ten percent of the cost of  the machine regardless whether they do anything or not. If the machine  costs you a million dollars, your maintenance contract is  100,000 per  year.  Is there anything that we have not addressed about the Oklahoma State  College of Veterinary Medicine? Or the profession?  We   ve touched on several things, but one major emphasis that   s come  out in the last few years, even though it   s been there all along is the  concept of one medicine/one health. That the dividing lines between  human medicine and animal medicine are pretty thin and then again the  idea that a lot of the things used in human medicine were developed in  veterinary medicine. Going back to basics, the syringe was developed by  a veterinarian because he couldn   t get certain animals to take medication  by mouth or any other way. Veterinarians were the first ones to discover  that diseases could be transmitted by arthropods. The Texas cattle  fever   two veterinarians discovered that it was transmitted by ticks and  from that Walter Reed, a physician, said that if cattle can get things  transmitted by ticks, why can   t people get things transmitted by  mosquitoes? And he   s the one that discovered that yellow fever was  transmitted to people by mosquitoes, which enabled the Panama Canal  to be built.  Previous attempts were  a wipe out because of yellow fever.  And again of the   I   m probably off a number or two here   but of the  ten new infectious diseases that evolved in the last decade, eight of them  have been zoonotic diseases, so if we can   t control them in animals,  we   re not going to be able to control them in people. One that   s hit the  news most recently of course is Avian Influenza. The anthrax scare     you   re familiar with that, with those that are around and I might say here  that a large number of veterinarians, including our graduates, actually  are now working for Homeland Security. Larry Barrett, whom I  mentioned even though his title is Director of Plum Island facility, he   s  paid by Homeland Security. And many others that are trained and are  training others to be first responders if pneumonic plague or other  zoonotic diseases are introduced. Veterinarians know as much or more  about it than other people. Another group I can think of, there was a guy  named Dave Johnson who was with U.S. Public Health Service   I  believe the Institute of Medicine but I am not sure   his job was to  develop new surgical techniques, primarily for the military. If somebody  says,    We   ve got to find a way to do a better shunt on the gall bladder,     30  Gill  Morgan  Gill  he and his team would develop that procedure in animals and then train  physicians who would do it in people. So the ever more obvious  interplay between veterinarians and human medicine, I   d say if I had to  pick one big evolution in the last 50 years, that   s it.  Anything else, Dr. Morgan?  No, I   ll wait to get the hate mail.  (Laughter) Oh, you don   t have to worry about that.  -------  -------
