 [laughter and discussion of recording equipment]

WASHBURN: So this is David Washburn conducting the interview, with --

RUSSELL: Polly Russell.

WASHBURN: Polly Russell. Today is the, 21st?

RUSSELL: Today is the 21st. September 21st.

WASHBURN: Yep, September 21st. September 21st and we are recording in San Pablo
California. So, may I call you Polly?

RUSSELL: Yes.

WASHBURN: Polly, we’re gonna start off with some basic questions and as things
go, you know, what you can and can’t remember is fine. And as things go
we’ll just have a discussion pretty much, between me and you, so don’t feel
like you are on the spot because it’s a discussion between both of us. So,
where were you born?

RUSSELL: In Las Cruces, New Mexico.

WASHBURN: And, uh, and can you tell me something about where you were raised and
who was in your family?

RUSSELL: Well, all my family lived there and we grew up in Las Cruces, all my
brothers and sisters, you know, that I had at that time. And at that point in
time, we were going to school, grammar school. And, we were very fortunate to be
able to go to -- we went to Catholic School. Holy Cross School. That was the
name of the school, Holy Cross School.

WASHBURN: And how many generations does your family go back in Las Cruces?

RUSSELL: Oh, well, there is another -- Marcus -- . We married, you know, some of
my family got married over there too. They’re all scattered, I mean, all over.
Right there it was just us at that time, and from there we -- everybody went
different directions when they graduated, you know. That is, I graduated!
[chuckles] And I was the oldest. Well, no, I take it back; I wasn’t the
oldest. But, I was at that time going to grammar school and then I went to high
school to [Uradua?] Academy and that was a convent. And then I worked. In
grammar school, I worked in this beauty shop, you know. And that’s where I
learned how to work, because she showed me how to work around the people, and
everything, and then she’s the one who suggested for me to go to beauty
school, to take up cosmetology. And, uh, she was responsible for that.
[chuckles] Then I took a beauty course after I finished school; I went to beauty
college in El Paso, Texas.

WASHBURN: Right, which is close to Las Cruces. Did you take a bus there?

RUSSELL: No, it was every day. It’s about sixty miles from Las Cruces, so I
had to board over there.

WASHBURN: Oh, you did?

RUSSELL: Yeah, I had to board over there with a teacher. The teacher had a home
that she offered to me, you know, to stay there and finish my schooling. After
that, then the lady that had employed me to work for her, of course, I went to
-- . Well, before that, I had to pass my examination. So I passed my
examination. All around beauty, cosmetology -- I passed the whole thing. And uh,
I worked over there until my family decided to come up this way.

WASHBURN: How was that decision made?

RUSSELL: My dad needed some employment, at that time. So he decided to move over
here. I don’t know, you know -- I was working all the time and I was kind of
going in and out, you know, and I didn’t kind of getting into all the personal
things, you know. We were very close to the family, all very close, and whatever
they said we did, you know, and that’s the way it happened. He moved over here
first and located -- Other Voice: That was 1943.

WASHBURN: 1943?

RUSSELL: Yeah, that’s the thing. I don’t remember the dates, you know.

WASHBURN: That’s okay. Well, so prior to coming out here, you were working --
did you end up working in a salon?

RUSSELL: Oh yes! With the lady that got me to be interested in beauty college,
yeah, in cosmetology.

WASHBURN: Who came to the salon?

RUSSELL: Oh well! She had a beauty salon and it had four employees, and with her
it was five. I was one of them, and I had my customers. I enjoyed fixing hair,
permanents, at that time. Of course, according to this, you know, at that time,
they had the old type permanent waves, with clips, you know. And today they
don’t have that. They have the cold waves today. They have the other ones.

WASHBURN: Was the clientele white or Mexican, or both?

RUSSELL: Both, both. It was right in the area where -- it was all kinds, you
know. Mostly, Anglo and Latin. Yeah, it was mixed, you know. There weren’t too
many other people. Just that, at that time.

WASHBURN: So, do you remember, what was your father doing for employment before
he moved to the Bay Area?

RUSSELL: Uh-huh. He was working in [Macia Park?]. And, I think he -- Other
Voice: He was working at the lumberyard in Las Cruces.

RUSSELL: Well, he came from [Macia Park?] and then he got employment. They were
having a difficult time, it was during that time of the -- what did they call it?

WASHBURN: The Depression?

RUSSELL: Yes, the Depression. It was the Depression. It was very hard to find a
job. There was the problem that he would work here and there. And that’s when
we went to, he went to -- no, I went to El Paso. I was the one who went to El
Paso. I graduated there. But, we lived there! What was that time that we went --
? Other voice: We went to El Paso [cross talk]

RUSSELL: Yeah, because my dad, for that reason too. He went to El Paso first, to
find employment. And, but then that was when I didn’t have beauty training
yet. Then we went back.

WASHBURN: So he came out here in 1943 by himself?

RUSSELL: Yeah, to find out about the job, yeah.

WASHBURN: To find work. Do you remember, he came out here because he heard about
the jobs related to the war?

RUSSELL: Yes, uh huh, yeah. He thought there would be more employment here. And,
we came to Brentwood first. And I didn’t come with him. I didn’t come with
him. I stayed over there until they got themselves settled over here. Other
Voice: Just mom, dad, and I came.

RUSSELL: Yeah. My sister Mary Lou was the one that came with them. And she went
to school over there in Brentwood. She was in grammar school, in that time. And
during that time, it was something very unusual for her. She used to tell us
this, “Guess what teacher did?” She said. “She put me up there to teach,
because I knew everything and the kids didn’t know anything.” [chuckles] She
was really good at her, you know, at teaching, at that time. But, I didn’t
come until afterwards, until they were settled, then I followed. I came by train.

WASHBURN: Tell me about that.

RUSSELL: I came by train, and, it was a Santa Fe. I came all the way down. Me
and my sister Franky.

WASHBURN: You guys together.

RUSSELL: We were together. And then we got established there, in Brentwood, too.
We didn’t stay there very long. My dad found work at Standard Oil. He was a
pipefitter. Then, I had to find a job, because I didn’t have my license here
in California. I had it for --

WASHBURN: Cosmetology license.

RUSSELL: -- New Mexico. But I needed to get a license for California, to go back
to my trade. So I needed some money to go to school, here, to get my license.
So, I looked around, and the only that thing was here was the shipyards. So
that’s when I went and applied. And they were taking people, but then they
were training them, you know, for different things. They had burners, you know,
and welding. Anyway, I took welding. They gave me welding, school for welding. I
went to their school. And then they gave me the test after I finished. Because
you have to past the test, you know. You weld so much, and then they cut it in
half and see how it, you know, if it’s solid and if it’s good, and then you
pass and they send you to areas to work. There was ship number 2 and ship number
3. I was number three. They placed me as a tacker. A tacker is where you are
underneath the skids, and they have the bulkheads that lay down flat, and then
you’re underneath with your partner. He held the iron and -- I forget now
what’s the name of it -- to hold the plate down, and then you weld it and then
he would put the metal nail or big rod. Then he’d hit it with a big hammer,
you know. [chuckles] Then he’d bring down the {inaudible}, you know. So you
can imagine, boy, that [well?] had to be tied good otherwise it would fall.
After that, then they put me aboard those ships. Right on the ships. I worked in
the tanks, in the little tanks that a big person could fit into them. I was very
small at that time. I was very small. So I got inside and did all the welding
overhead and on the side. And did all the welding for the little tanks. And
then, too, on the ship, the whole ship. It’s got a bigger rod. It’s a great
big rod, and just weld the whole, the actual ship. Uh, huh. And I did that, not
only on the bottom, but then the side too, the bulkheads on the side. All over
the ship, all over the ship. Before I went up there, you have to set up your own
machines. The machine was there; it’s all yours; you have to set the
temperature; and you had your equipment, which consisted of the cable -- long,
long cable -- wrap it around and put it on your shoulder. You have to have your
cap, of course. Because otherwise, if you know about welding, if anybody sees
the welding, you get a flash. Your eyes will burn and you can’t see for a
certain length of time. And so, everybody was -- you put your cap down and you
start welding over there, outside. I used to work outside in the skids. You get
on, and the skids are iron and they have holes. And you took care of your pale,
everything, your welding rods and everything. You carried them with you. It just
seemed to be normal to me. I was a trooper at that time and I just jumped all
over the thing and, just did my own -- everybody was on their own. There was no
such thing as just because you’re a lady, you know, a girl, anybody helps you.
Nobody helps you. And you don’t expect anybody to help you. And I didn’t
expect it either. I wasn’t used to it, anyways. I was always self-sufficient,
you know. That’s where I worked, and used to take the lunch at break time. Oh,
that’s where I had my ears pierced. [laughs]

WASHBURN: Hmm, hmm. Tell me about that. Where?

RUSSELL: Oh, this girl, you know, cutting up. “Oh,” she says, “I can
pierce your ears.” She would do it for the girls. And I said, “Okay, you can
pierce my ears.” That’s where I had my ears pierced, at the shipyards. [laughs]

WASHBURN: You didn’t have your ears pierced before. Well, why not?

RUSSELL: No. We weren’t used to that. Well, it wasn’t the thing to do back
home. We weren’t exposed to that, you know.

WASHBURN: In Las Cruces?

RUSSELL: In Las Cruces, yeah. When we came over here, there was a lot of things
going on, you know. And during the time, I was twenty-years-old. I was just --
you know, when you’re young. And then, Las Cruces was nothing. Over here, it
was really during the war, during the time when there was a lot of action, a lot
of activity. And all the forces were here -- the navy, the army -- you would see
them all around here. And for entertainment, there was the dance halls. There
was a place called Sweets in Oakland. And everybody, the big name bands were
there -- Benny Goodman and all that. I got to see them. Gene Kupra. They’re
all famous. You don’t know them.

WASHBURN: No, I do know them. Gene Krupa, the drummer and Benny Goodman,
clarinet player. Mary Lou: Henry James.

RUSSELL: Henry James. Yeah, all of them.

WASHBURN: What are some other entertainment spots that you remember?

RUSSELL: Oh, well, actually, I was working in San Francisco, at that time, you
know. I went to school. I finally got out of the shipyards. While I was in the
shipyards, I even worked in the canteens. And then I got some money to get my
license. So, that’s what I did all during that time, in ’45. Yes, I was
twenty-years-old and it was ‘45, I think.

WASHBURN: Well, let me ask you some specific questions about the shipyards. Your
story has been fantastic so far. Well, let me ask you first about the ear
piercing, because it seems like it was a neat time. Did all the ladies out here,
did you notice that they had their ears pierced?

RUSSELL: It kind of spread around, yeah, at that time. I think that was where it
started, people piercing their ears. Most of the girls did get their ears
pierced, because they did it there, you know.

WASHBURN: Was it a group thing? Can you describe how it happened?

RUSSELL: No. Yeah, well everybody would kind of get together at lunch time and
talk. It was kind of a thing that they would do there, you know. In fact, they
had some rings made out of metal. Everybody would have a ring. It was steel.
They had access to all this stuff. Of course, there were a lot of things that --
well, let’s see what can I tell you about there -- ?

WASHBURN: Well, do you remember who pierced it?

RUSSELL: No. I remember the lady, you know, and I can picture her, but I can’t
remember her name.

WASHBURN: Well, what did she look like?

RUSSELL: She was white. She was a white woman. She’s probably remember that
too, cause she was the one who did all the piercing. And I was the one that she
pierced, my ears.

WASHBURN: So she pierced a lot of people’s ears?

RUSSELL: Oh, a lot of girls, at that time. They were all real young at that
time, too, you know. So they had their ears pierced by her. Otherwise, I don’t
know how long it would have been after that that I would have had -- because I
was working. I was always working. I worked at the canteens. Aboard ship, aboard
ship. That’s where the canteens were, right on the ship. They had a canteen
where all the service -- it was navy, all navy and they would come by to get
their soup or candy or whatever, that they would buy. Like they say, practice
makes perfect and I was really good at it, you know. [laughs]

WASHBURN: Why did you move from welding to the canteens and what was your job there?

RUSSELL: At the canteens? Well, cashier and give the items that they asked for.
That was after I got away from the welding. I got away from the welding and I
came to work at the canteens.

WASHBURN: Did you choose to do that?

RUSSELL: Yes. Then, there was a big restaurant on shipyard number three. I
forget what’s the name of it, but it was well known at that time. The buses
the transit, the buses would go over there from Richmond with the workers to the
shipyards, because the shipyards were located over there, s</transcript><transcript_alt></transcript_alt><rights></rights><fmt></fmt><usage></usage><userestrict>0</userestrict><xmllocation></xmllocation><xmlfilename></xmlfilename><collection_link></collection_link><series_link></series_link></record></ROOT>
