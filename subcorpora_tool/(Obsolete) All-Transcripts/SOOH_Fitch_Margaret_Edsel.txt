 Finchum  Today is April 1, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library, and we   re doing an oral history  project with women who have served in extension, home demonstration,  home economics, whatever you want to call it these days. The name has  changed many times. Today we   re in El Reno with Margaret Fitch.  Did you attend OSU?  Yes.  When you graduated?     42.  Did you go to work right after finishing?  Yes.  What do you remember about the Oklahoma A M campus?  I can   t remember as much because I   ve had a stroke.  When you went to work for Extension, did you have a favorite part of  your job?  Probably clothing but I enjoyed all of it. I worked with women and the  boys.  You did 4-H?  Yes.  And then you taught adults as well?  5  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Yes.  And did you teach them how to can, to preserve?  Yes.  Did you have a garden, yourself?  No.  You just taught them how to do theirs.  That   s right.  So when you practiced at home, you just had to get what you could get?  Yes, of course.  When you were teaching them how to sew, was it dresses or jackets?  Both, as well as suits.  Wool, or     And aprons. Everything.  Did you have to wear a uniform when you first started?  Yes. When I was in 4-H, I had a uniform. In fact, I have some pictures  of them.  When you were a home demonstration agent, did you have to wear a  uniform then, too?  No.  Pants or a dress?  Just dresses, because we wouldn   t wear pants then.  And you had to work in high heels?  Yes, of course.  In the summer heat in Oklahoma that had to be tough.  6  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Yes.  When you first started, you had to have a car?  Yes.  And how did you manage to get one?  My brother had got one for me.  Was it hard for a woman to get her first car back in those days?  Well, not too much of a problem for me because my brother helped me.  Were you born in Oklahoma?  Yes. In Seiling.  Just up the road. I remember seeing a sign for it.  Yes, right.  Did you have a master   s degree, too?  Well, not for a couple years later.  Was it from OSU, too?  Yes.  OSU, orange, orange, orange.  Of course. (Laughter) In fact, you see, everything around here says  Oklahoma State.  Were you the first in your family to go to college?  No, because my older sisters were both in college.  Were they in home economics as well?  No, they weren   t. The first one was a teacher, the other was a nurse, and  the other was a bookkeeper.  All dealing a little bit with people.  7  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Yes.  How did you get interested in home economics?  Ever since I was a little kid, I loved 4-H work. I always wanted to be a  home economics teacher.  Did you actually get to teach in a school?  For the first year only. The rest of the time, I was in Extension.  Which did you like better?  Of course, I liked Extension best.  You have worked with a lot of people.  Yes.  And you went to their homes?  Yes.  Out in the country, too?  Yes.  Did you have a favorite topic that you would teach them?  Well, really, I think everything, but probably clothing was my favorite.  When did you retire?  Well, after I left Extension, I went to     Arizona to work for a little while.  That was still with Extension.  Okay.  But then for World Home Economics, I was working on it after I retired.  So, you really didn   t retire, then.  No. (Laughter)  8  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  You were the president of the International Home Economics  Association for a while  1980-1984 ?  I was the first one from the United States, in that position.  That is impressive.  We have one other person this year that has served in that same position,  but so far there   s just the two of us.  You were the first  What were some of the things you had to do in that  position?  Well, it   s working with, somewhat, the same kinds of things and seeing  the problems of people worldwide rather than just within a county.  Did you get to travel to other countries?  Yes, I traveled very much. In fact, our headquarters was in Paris, and so  we always had two meetings a year in that area. And then we had  assignments that we   d go to other places in other countries.  To see what they were doing and what they needed?  Yes.  And to develop lesson plans and things like that?  Yes.  Did they pay for you to go to Paris or did you have to?  I paid for most of them. The first time, it was paid. Later we gave that  money for another purpose, so I didn   t use it.  I   d say you did a very good job.  I don   t know.  You were also the president of the association here in Oklahoma.  Yes, and the United States, and then for the world.  You just worked all the time, didn   t you?  Yes. I loved it. (Laughter)  9  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  It really wasn   t work then, I guess.  No. I enjoyed it.  It wasn   t a 40 hour a week job.  Oh, no, no. (Laughs)  You had to work weekends, too?  That   s right, but as I said, I still enjoyed it so it was okay.  Do you remember any professors from OAMC? The name I keep coming  across is Emma Chandler.  Oh, yes, she was the first person in that position who helped us. She  knew quite a bit about 4-H and our international activities. Dean Lela  O   Toole was really a person who helped me make all of my decisions, I  think. She supported my activities, even encouraged me to move into the  Aggiettes  OAMC pep club .  I read a little bit about her. She was a remarkable woman.  Absolutely.  The other name I come across is Norma Brumbaugh.  Oh, yes. Yes, that   s true. In 4-H, Zella King was probably as helpful a  person.  I haven   t seen that name. I   ll watch for it. I haven   t looked at 4-H as  much as I have the home demonstration. I   m learning that it all ties  together.  Yes. (Laughter)  Did you have a mentor?  Oh, I probably would say I had a number of them, because many people  helped me all the way. From 4-H and in all of my work there are people  who have supported me and have done so much to help me. I couldn   t  have done it unless I had help.  And then you helped others.  Yes. Well, I think I had more help than I gave. (Laughs)  10  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  People would argue with you on that, I think. Was there a part of the job  that you really didn   t like?  No. I guess I never thought of there being something I didn   t like about  it.  The monthly reports?  Oh, well, maybe that   s right. The secretaries kept us on the ball to get it  done.  Was your office in a courthouse?  No. We had an office in another place    well yes, I guess the last few  years it was part of the courthouse.  That seems to be where they used to be.  Yes.  Did you have your own sewing machine?  Yes. In fact, I still have it.  Was it fun making clothes?  Yes.  There are not too many fabric stores left.  No, there aren   t.  When was the last time that you were on campus?  Three months ago.  Not long then.  I went for the  OSU Alumni  Hall of Fame.  It   s changed a lot, hasn   t it?  Oh, yes. They say there are so many new buildings.  It   s a pretty campus.  11  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Yes, I think it   s getting better.  When you were going there, did you have to go through the practice  house?  Yes.  What was that like?  Well, it was okay. It was a lot of things that we had already learned in  our home, which helps.  You had to sleep there?  Oh, yes, that   s right.  And was there just one?  No, I think there were two.  You had to do that before you could graduate?  Yes, right.  Was it pretty close to campus?  Yes.  Which dorm did you live in?  My first year, I lived out in town. I cooked for four women, ladies, for  the first year.  And that   s how you paid your way through?  Well, it was not much.  Not much? (Laughter)  But it helped, yes. They were good people and I enjoyed them.  Were you raised on a farm?  No, three acres.  And you were still interested in 4-H?  12  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Yes.  Did your grandparents have a farm?  That was too long ago. (Laughter)  So, you did 4-H through school.  Yes.  Did your mother belong to a demonstration club?  No, she did not.  Did you belong to a demonstration club at some point?  No.  You just went out and helped them do their things.  Yes.  I understand there   s not as many as there used to be.  No, there aren   t.  So, you would have started your work somewhat during the war time?  Yes.  And so it would   ve been important to teach how to preserve and  conserve?  Canning was important.   Did you use  pressure cookers?  Oh, of course. We had to learn how to take care of those, as well. And  we had to repair them.  You had to fix them yourself?  Yes, usually. Well, sometimes we could have people who could help.  Some of the men came in and would help us.  You had to carry a lot of things from your car, back and forth.  13  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Of course, yes. Our cars usually had a little of everything in them.  Did they tell you that when you interviewed for the job?  I guess we didn   t even ask any questions. We just did what they told us  to do. (Laughter)  And were happy to have a job.  That   s right.  Did you work in different counties, or mostly Canadian?  I went one year in the Panhandle before I came back to Canadian   County .  And you retired after 25 years, from Canadian County?  No. I didn   t retire.  No?  I went to Arizona for, I think, five years and then I went to Hawaii, and I  was there for about five years.  I   ve never been there. It   s pretty isn   t it?  Yes. It   s wonderful.  Quite different from Oklahoma. How did you come to go there?  It was a good opportunity to go, so I took it. (Laughter) After I   d left  Hawaii, then I went into retirement.  Okay. After you retired, what did you do?  I worked with International Home Economics.  And then after that?  I guess that   s when I had my stroke.  That   s when you officially retired.  Yes.  14  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Do you have the first apron you ever made?  No. But I have my pictures of when we went to  4-H  Roundup.  That was on  the OSU  campus too.  Yes.  You got used to Oklahoma State University really early.  Yes, that   s right.  And wouldn   t think about going anywhere else?  No, never.  Did OU have a home economics program, the University of Oklahoma?  Yes, it has a good one, too.  You didn   t even think about going there?  Oh, no, because of 4-H. I went exactly where I wanted to be. (Laughter)  You were familiar with campus by the time you got there.  Yes, that   s right.  Besides working for those four women, how else did you manage to pay  your tuition?  My brother took care of the responsibilities so I didn   t have to worry  about it.  It wasn   t as much as it is now.  No, (laughs) no, goodness no.  At that time, did you do your own laundry or did you send it home?  Oh, you   d have to do it yourself. You didn   t ask people to help you.  What was the library like when you were there?  When I graduated we sponsored the library and used it for our program  that we would help. So, we thought a lot of the library.  15  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  When you were there, you were in the pep club?  Yes.  Was it the Aggiettes Pep Order?  Yes, it was.  So you went to football games and basketball games?  Yes. Well, I had tickets for the activities, so I went to those.  And were you in a sorority?  Yes. Delta Zeta, but I think it   s not there now.  You were pretty busy.  Yes. I enjoyed it, though. It was good for me.  Got you ready for your job.  Yes.  Did you have to keep a monthly calendar, a schedule of what you did  week to week or day to day?  Oh, of course.  Did you save any of those?  I didn   t keep that because I had so much other stuff.  Can   t keep it all, can we?  No.  Did you do very much writing?  No but I think I still have some, if I can find those.  When you were working, did you write newspaper articles yourself?  Oh, yes. That was the kind of thing you had to do every week.  Yourself.  16  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Well, sometimes they came in and interviewed us, so they   d just tell us   the topic  and we   d talk about it.  As new topics came up, you   d have to go be trained?  Yes. Yes, but that was every year. We had to keep up with what was  happening.  You had to constantly be learning.  Yes.  Did you participate in county fairs?  I loved them, yes, because we had our own sale. And then we   d have to  go to other counties and help with them, too.  Did you serve as judge?  Yes, yes.  You could not judge in your own county, though?  Oh, no. Just help each of them to get ready for the programs.  That took a lot of after-work time, too, didn   t it?  Yes, it did, but it was good, and as I   d say, it   s still good.  They were lucky to have you.  No, I think I was fortunate to have good people.  I guess it goes both ways.  Yes.  Do you get to see some of your former 4-H children?  Some of them still come by and see me.  It sounds like it has been a very good life.  Yes, it has.  Constantly busy.  17  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  But that   s what made it so good and interesting.  And you could see progress in the people you were working with.  That   s right.  When you were working with them, did you ever have something that  didn   t go quite right, like your bread didn   t rise or something like that?  I   m sure we had plenty of problems, (laughter) but I don   t remember.  They weren   t major ones, then.  No.  Well, as much traveling as you did, did you ever have car trouble?  Oh, when I was first working, the problems were terrible to keep our car  in shape. And many times, I   d have problems getting the car back in  shape.  Had three flats in one day the first year or two of work.   The roads weren   t too good in those days, either, some of the country  roads.  No. No, they weren   t.  About how early in the morning would you get started?  No earlier than eight because I   ve never liked to get up very much,  (laughter) so I was always a little bit slow.  And then you   d work past dark?  Yes, yes. I didn   t care how late I was working. Many times it would be  almost midnight.  Well, no wonder you didn   t want to get up.  If we had activities, we   d keep going.  And you had to practice a lot at home, too.  Yes.  To get it right. When you were in charge of the association, did you meet  here in Oklahoma City or was it other places?  18  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Usually, here.  If you competed in the county fairs, did you also go to the state fair?  Yes. And we took pride in how many honors we could get.  And then did they compete to the next level? Were there national ones?  For the kids, yes, they have. And I have, too.  Did you win something?  Well, when I was in 4-H, I went to Chicago with my dress. And the 4-H  kids that I   ve worked with, they   re much better than I ever was. They  always won so many  more  awards than I did.  That just means you were a good teacher.  Well, I don   t know, but anyway, it was good work.  Sure, and it made you feel good.  Yes.  And them feel good. Chicago   s quite a ways away for high school kids to  have gone to back in the    30s and    40s.  That was when I was in 4-H that I went to Chicago, and Kansas City  also, with another award. Then, of course, we had other programs and I  attended those when I was in 4-H.  How would you travel, like to Chicago? By bus or train?  We went by train.  Train rides were exciting, I bet.  Oh, of course. We enjoyed it. And we could get acquainted with  everybody in our group.  And you brought back ribbons?  Yes.  So, you had two sisters and a brother?  19  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Oh, no, I had four sisters and three brothers.  A big family.  Yes, from a great big family.  What order were you?  I was the fourth person.  Kind of in the middle, then.  Yes. So, most of them were older and helped, took on the responsibility  of us.  You didn   t live on a farm but did you still raise your own chickens and  such?  I think we had some chickens and a garden. We had a big garden and  blackberries. My brother didn   t like those. He had to take care of  blackberries.  They get you itchy.  Yes.  Did you made blackberry jam?  Yes.  What did your parents do for a living?  During my lifetime,  Dad  worked for the oil company and, of course,  Mother was a homemaker.  With seven or eight children, she stayed busy.  That   s all she needed. (Laughter) She had plenty of jobs.  She did. Where did she keep her canned goods?  We had a cellar.  When you were working, did you have a favorite cookbook?  Yes, but I can   t tell you which one.  20  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  But you had one that you   d go to more than others?  Yes, that   s right.  Cooking wasn   t your favorite thing?  No, clothing was my favorite.  Did you have a favorite color when you would work with your fabric?  I don   t think I had one. Blue, probably blue was my favorite.  Do you remember working with what they called    stretch and sew  fabric   ?  Yes. I bought a separate sewing machine so I could do that.  It took a different one?  Yes, yes. A different one, so I could do it.  Could you repair your own sewing machine?  No, not really.  Just some of the minor things?  Yes, that   s all.  Did you quilt?  No, not at all.  Did your mother?  No.  Didn   t have time, did she?  No, she didn   t. Not with that many kids.   Did you have  hand-me-down clothes?  No, because my sisters were older so they didn   t fit me, but my younger  sister, she   d have to take some of mine. (Laughter)  21  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  So you lucked out.  Yes.  When you got to college, did you have very many clothes?  I had time to sew everything that I wanted. I had it ready.  Ah. You were organized and prepared.  Yes.  Always have been, sounds like. When you were working, did you work  with the county agent, the man?  Yes, yes. (Laughter)  Would he help you carry things in and out?  Not much. No, he wouldn   t. Of course, my first person was really a good  person. I   ve worked with a lot of them.  Was it easy to get promoted, being a woman?  I don   t think I   ve ever had any  problems . I don   t think it   s ever made  any difference.  Okay. Well, are the county directors usually men?  Yes. Oh, but there was one other that was a white woman.  Just one?  Yes, I think so.  Those numbers aren   t too good then.  No. But, of course, I didn   t worry because we had our own programs.  Do you happen to remember what your salary was when you started?  Probably about  1,000 a year.  A year? That wouldn   t go too far today.  No. (Laughter)  22  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  What do you remember about being interviewed for your first job?  I know she asked me to take off my hat.  Take it off?  Yes, to see, I guess, I don   t know why, maybe how tall I was.  Interesting. Did you have to wear gloves?  Yes. If we went anywhere we dressed up with our gloves and our hat.  You had to look sharp, professional.  Yes, yes.  Could you wear whatever  hat  you wanted?  The only time I can remember with hats is just that I   d wear them to  look nice.  So, you could choose?  Yes.  And the gloves had to be white?  Yes, that   s right.  And did you always wear an apron when you cooked?  No, no. Never did that.  It must   ve been a fun job.  It was.  But very busy.  Yes, it was, but it was good.  Did your phone ring a lot?  Yes, and nights. Didn   t make a difference whether it was day or night,  they would call. They   d need something.  23  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Ask how to get a stain out?  Yes, whatever came up.  Did you have things close by to answer those questions?  Usually it was in our mind or we could always say we   d call you back  and give you the information.  And who would you call if you didn   t know the answer?  A specialist.  Okay. A notch above you?  Yes.  That was nice to have someone to back you up.  Yes.  If it was all up here, then you were a walking encyclopedia.  (Laughs) No, not really, but they expected us to be that.  Most of the time you were, though, if you could answer without having to  ask on up the line.  Yes, they   d expect us to be able to do that.  Was the same question was asked over and over, like how to get the wax  to set when you canned?  Yes, or get the spots off of the floor if you have candles, if you   ve used  candles. That   s always a big problem.  People are all the time asking,    How do you get stains out?    Grape  juice or that type of thing.  Yes, yes.  And you won the Bennett Award.  Yes.  Do you want to talk a little bit about that?  24  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Well, there isn   t much to tell. It was a nice award. I have it right over  here for you to see. I appreciate receiving it.  It must   ve been a thrill to get it.  Yes, it was nice.  President Bennett wasn   t there when you were there, was he?  Yes, he was. He was killed about that time. At first he was here.  That makes it even more special if you knew him.  Yes.  And he probably knew almost everyone on campus.  Reverend Willham did the best job of knowing names. When I came,  he   d always shake my hand and even when I received my recognition,  he just called me by name.  That   s remarkable, isn   t it?  Yes.  When you were working with all the 4-H students and the home  demonstration  agents , you probably knew a lot of people, too.  I used to, and I took pride in being out, meeting people I knew.  Couldn   t go to the store without someone recognizing you?  Yes. I hear it still happens. (Laughter) It   s what they tell me.  I think you   d be hard to forget. You have impacted a lot of lives.  Well.  And then you give back to the university in various ways.  Yes. Hall of Fame is the one that I always try to go to.  That   s once a year?  Yes.  25  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  That   s a long trip for you from here. It takes a little while. I came down   Highway  81 from Kingfisher. There   s a lot of farmland through here.  That   s good people who live in there. Canadian County used to be one  of the best, especially with wheat. So, we always took pride in being  Canadian County members.  It used to be a railroad town?  Yes, yes it was.  Rock Island, is that right?  Yes.  They said there used to be what they called a round house?  Yes. I don   t think I even know if it   s still here.  And would you take the train from El Reno to places?  No, never.  And when you traveled for work     I used my car.  Did you have any flat tires while you were working?  Oh, lots of those, sometimes twice a day  early in my career .  Really?  Yes, it was horrible.  Could you change one yourself?  Yes, I had to. In fact, my brother taught me how. He said,    If you   re  going to drive, you   ve got to know how to change a tire.     Nowadays you   d use a cell phone and call someone to come fix it.  Yes, I know. (Laughter) It makes a difference. It   s good. Yes, things  have improved so much.  A lot of what your work was has changed some too, hasn   t it?  26  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Oh, of course.  What do you think is the major difference?  Families    lifestyles have changed. That makes a difference.  Two people working; Mom and Dad both working.  That   s right.  And fast food restaurants have made a difference, too; convenience.  Yes, yes.  They   re teaching more money management or time management.  Yes, indeed, it is and it   s something people need. Money management is  really important. Even now, all the people. The newspaper says how  much that needs to be done.  And children need exercise. I   m assuming that would be something you  would teach if you were still teaching?  Yes, in fact, I was doing some of it before.  For a little while, you helped with polio activities in your county, back in  the    50s and    60s.  Yes.  And you got recognized for doing something with rural housing  improvement.  Oh, yes, I   d forgotten about that. Yes.  It was a pretty big deal.  We had some good programs on that.  I think you won an award because you had involved so many people in  it.  I   d forgotten about that.  For a while, you were an associate director?  27  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Yes. Yes, but that was in Hawaii.  Was that a little bit different type of work?  Well, really, it was while another person was gone, so it was the same  type of thing. When you work with people, it   s the same type of things  for everybody.  As an associate director, you wouldn   t be doing the long hours, though,  would you?  Sure, same thing.  You would still be going out and doing lessons and things like that?  Yes.  I hope you got paid more as the associate director.  Well, a little bit but not much. (Laughter) But money wasn   t the  problem.  That wasn   t what motivated you.  No.  It was people. Doing what you could to help the people. Do you  remember Cleo Bryan?  Oh, yes, very well. We were good friends.  I read where she had published a cookbook,    Seems Like I Done it This  A-way.     Yes, that   s right. We were good friends.  Did you get into any mischief together?  No, we didn   t.  Did you get into any trouble?  I probably have had plenty of it. (Laughter)  Well, you don   t have to tell unless you just want to.  28  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  I can remember one time. I can   t remember exactly what it was, but it  was over some kind of program that the  county  director wasn   t happy  with something that I was doing. But it didn   t matter. I decided I didn   t  care what he thought. (Laughter)  How did you get by with it?  I went back to the district man and had him to help me. (Laughter)  Do you remember what the topic was?  No, I can   t. I had a number of problems with him, so it doesn   t matter.  (Laughter) But I never worried because I knew they would say what I  did was okay.  You stood up for yourself.  Yes.  Using some of those same skills you were teaching the demonstration  clubs; leadership and self confidence and all that.  That   s right.  If it was only once or twice in your career, that   s not too bad.  Oh, I don   t know. Maybe it happened a lot of times, but it was still okay.  It was still alright. I wasn   t worried. (Laughter)  You had some spunk.  Yes. And I was sure of myself, too, so it didn   t worry me.  You set a good example.  Well, I don   t know.  I understand you spent some time in the Congo.  I have some pictures from Africa where I have worked with them.  That must   ve been interesting.  Oh, they were very good people. They liked to do things.  And how did you come to go there?  29  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  That was part of the international.  Did you go as a group or by yourself?  I went by myself to give some demonstrations. I think I have some  papers of the programs.  You did not have any trouble traveling by yourself?  No, never.  Did you navigate pretty well? Get from the airport to where you needed  to be pretty easily?  In that time, I didn   t have any problems. I   ve been around the world.  And then chose to stay in Oklahoma.  Yes.  When you were in the international position, did you have an assistant?  Oh, no. This was really volunteer work.  So, you had to really want to do it and have the finances to do it.  Yes.  Was it for one year or two years?  Four years.  Four years? That   s a long time.  First before  being  president, you   ve got to serve as president-elect.  That requires a lot of new learning, too, doesn   t it?  Yes, but it   s good. You see so many people throughout the world. It was  good.  It   s interesting that the same problems happen.  That   s amazing. That   s exactly the truth, that there are the same kinds of  problems throughout the world.  30  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Fitch  Finchum  Water quality is probably at the top of the list?  Yes. Lots of water issues.  Did you ever think about getting your PhD and being a professor?  Being a professor? No. In fact, one of the people asked me why I didn   t  get my doctorate and I said,    I enjoy what I   m doing more than changing  it.    I didn   t want to take the time to go for my doctorate.  If you were working until midnight, you didn   t have time to work on one.  No, but I did what I enjoyed.  That   s saying a lot. You had to make yourself happy.  Yes, I have been. And I   m still happy about it.  That  shows . And you   re still in Oklahoma.  Right   I don   t have any more questions unless you want to tell me something  else.  No, I don   t have any.  Well, we   ll close this out. Thank you for sharing your story with me  today.  Well, thank you.  It   s a pleasure to meet you.  I appreciate your time.  It   s been great.  -------  -------
