Speaker 1: I want to know - your father who - he passed away when you were fifteen, right?
Speaker 2: Almost fifteen, fourteen.
Speaker 1: His name was Reverend Arthur Jerome Wright [Sr.], and I wanted you to tell me what you know about his family.
Speaker 2: He comes from a family of people who saw needs and tried to respond.  His father, Arthur Eames Wright [grandfather], was a minister and also started a school in Gaffney, South Carolina.  His mother, whom I never had the privilege of meeting, Grandma Rachel, was a very wise woman.  I have a picture of her and - tall woman of integrity, had, oh, eight children, and - but they were people of great faith, but they were also leaders.  I have wonderful kind of archives that show them before the school they started, but people who served, people who responded to need, people who were intelligent, and my grandfather had the chance to get educated.  My father put great credence in education and commitment to family, and one of the things I remember from my childhood was not only spending time on the old plantation down in Gaffney but the commitment to his older Aunt Cora and Aunt Alice who, when they got too old to make it on their own in Gaffney, moved to Bennettsville [South Carolina] which is where we lived, and we took care of them, and I remember that when his sister Aura died, her five children moved to Bennettsville, and many of them went on to excel long ago.  I mean, my Cousin Artis, who's still alive, went to Hunter College [New York, New York] in the very early days, and her daughter I'm very proud of is now the Dean of Students at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], but it's a family that valued helping others.  It valued family.  It valued service, and it valued living their faith, and so I feel very grateful to have that.
Speaker 1: Did he share any stories with you or at least one about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess I knew a lot about his growing up because we were taken back to Gaffney very often.  We had the Limestone Baptist Church [Gaffney, South Carolina] which my Aunt Cora's husband and my father's family were instrumental in founding and getting established.  We had a family reunion there - I don't know - fifteen years ago, but the red clay of Gaffney from the time we were the youngest children because we visited often was a part of that upbringing.  I mean we learned a lot about slavery.  We learned a lot about the family struggles.  Grandpa A.E. [Arthur Eames Wright] was the son of a slave owner and - but family stories at table and exposure to family was something that was just a part of our growing up and being back and forth on the plantations and in the areas where my parents and my dad grew up.  I met all of my uncles and aunts who were a part of his larger family.  Many of them were sleeping car porters.  Few of them had the education he had.  He had been in World War II - World War I, excuse me - and had been shell-shocked, but after he got out of World War I, he went into the - went and got his G.I. Bill [Federal assistance to veterans for educational purposes] and got an education, and I think he was one of the few among his family members, his direct sisters and brothers.  That's not true.  His brothers didn't get college educations, but his sisters did and taught early on, but he often recounted those stories, and the people of the generation before him were a very much a part of our lives, and as I said to you, Aunt Cora, Aunt Aura, [Aunt] Alice, where we used to go sleep as children, and they had an old well where we used to draw water, and boy, did they cook good biscuits and fried chicken and wonderful things from their gardens, and so that whole self-help tradition of growing things and being on the land and of being together and of helping each other is just one that I remembered very directly so it was less what they taught us by saying.  We overheard the conversations.  You pick up so much from just being around adults, and children and adults have very intertwined lives, and I'm very grateful for that.
Story_ID: 17643
Speaker 1: And your mother, what - her name was Maggie Leola Bowen Wright.
Speaker 2: Maggie Leola Bowen Wright.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she - do you know much about her family, her side of the family, and was she from, also, originally, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: She was from South Carolina, grew up in Mount Pleasant, and I've been learning a lot more.  My sister [Olive] and I are doing a lot of kind of digging now, but I remember meeting my Great-grandma Isabella Pudegan who was a very wiry little black woman who lived to be far over 100, and we've been reconnecting with that family and learning more about my mother's family from Charleston [South Carolina] and their lives, and again Great-grandma Pudegan was fathered - mothered six children by a white plantation overseer but was a very strong, independent woman who believed in education, and her children got a good education.  They lived together quite openly in Charleston and Mount Pleasant [South Carolina], and I went not so long ago to visit her burial place and have been gathering stories from her grandson and her great-granddaughter whom we are reconnecting with, and one of the things we're contemplating is a family reunion down in Mount Pleasant to kind of reweave that history for our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren so I've learned a lot more.  My mother didn't talk a whole lot about it.  I remember my grandmother.  In fact, I was up last night in Harlem [New York] at the Marian Anderson Center Drama Theater to celebrate Maya Angelou and passed by Manhattan Avenue, and I used to spend lots of summers up on - at 454 Manhattan Avenue, and when I passed by, that building has been torn down, but my mother's mother moved north, and she and Grandpa Wright [Arthur Eames Wright], who turns out to have been quite something - Grandpa Bowen, excuse me - who was a preacher from someplace down in South Carolina whom I remember quite vividly, but they moved to Manhattan and had a number of children.  It's interesting that my mother and my father [Reverend Arthur Jerome Wright, Sr.] were the only ones in their family who remained in the South and who came back to the South after going North to spend some time, and I've often thought that that fabric of family was maintained in a way that many of my Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and New York cousins in Harlem did not manage to maintain always in the same way, but I do remember my uncles and my aunts and my grandparents on my mother's side, and that one great visit with Great-grandma Isabella, whom I now know was a pretty extraordinary and independent woman.
Story_ID: 17644
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents [Reverend Arthur Jerome Wright, Sr. and Maggie Leola Bowen Wright] met?
Speaker 2: Do I know how my parents met is interesting.  I'm just - they were in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and we're just piecing a lot of that together, and I realized that my father's best friend was Reverend Lucius M. Tobin, who was Professor of Religion at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and that Isabelle [Isabella] Tobin, who is now up in her eighties and the largest - I love it - she was on the cover of our Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] Messenger [magazine] recently as the most generous alumni donor at Spelman.  I asked for Reverend Tobin's letters because they were at Mom and Daddy's wedding, and so she, in fact, is somebody I've got coming down to Haley [Haley Farm of the Children's Defense Fund, Clinton, Tennessee],  so my sister and I can pick her brains and learn all the stories about my parents' early marriage, which I don't know the details of their meeting, but I know their courtship.
Speaker 1: So they actually met up North.
Speaker 2: They met in Philadelphia where my parents - my mother was living, and my father worked for the American-French Service Commission.  We're in the process of tracking down all of that history, but they then moved back to South Carolina because Dr. J. J. Starks, who was then the first black president of Benedict College [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina], was a mentor to my father who had gone to Morris College [Morris College, Sumter, South Carolina] and graduated from Morris and had been the pastor of the Shiloh Baptist Church in Bennettsville, South Carolina, and he called my father to that church, and that's the one church that my father remained in for his whole life, and after he died, my brother, Harry [Reverend Harry Starks Wright], who was named after Dr. Starks, who is now the minister at Cornerstone Baptist Church in Brooklyn [New York], succeeded my father, and it's interesting.  My brother is on the verge of retiring from Cornerstone, and he's moving back to Bennettsville because that is truly home, and my sister has moved back to Bennettsville, and the Children's Defense Fund has a project in the house where I was born, which is the Freedom School Curriculum Laboratory so I must say my mother and father live very much on in the church and in the commitment to education, and there are still a few of the same old souls who were there when I was growing up who still are part of our lives.
Story_ID: 17645
Speaker 1: And Bennettsville, where is it?  It's located how far - I mean how large of a town is it?
Speaker 2: Oh, Bennettsville is in the northeast corner of South Carolina very near the North Carolina line, eight or ten miles from the North Carolina line.  We're about forty miles south of Florence [South Carolina], ninety miles from Charlotte [North Carolina], a little over ninety miles from Columbia [South Carolina], sixty miles south of Fayetteville [North Carolina].  Oh, it's a town of, I guess, now - when I was growing up, there was five or 6,000.  The whole county is about 30,000, about half white, some native Americans, but majority black.
Speaker 1: And you - your siblings, was Olive the oldest or not?
Speaker 2: Olive [sister] is the oldest.
Speaker 1: She's the oldest.
Speaker 2: She's the oldest.
Speaker 1: And then who's after that?
Speaker 2: Arthur Jerome Wright, Jr., who lived for many, many years in Brooklyn [New York] and has now moved back to Goldston, North Carolina, which is where his wife comes from.  It's interesting how we're all gravitating back south.  My brother, Harry [Reverend Harry Starks Wright], is the third child, who is living in Brooklyn as well and has just bought a house next to my sister in Bennettsville.  When he will retire, he'll go back there, and my brother, Julian, who was the only one who never left home and who taught in North Carolina, but we lost him, two years, three years ago.  My mother [Maggie Leola Bowen Wright] and father [Reverend Arthur Jerome Wright, Sr.], my father had started a home for the aged across the street, and my mother built a new home for the aged behind the church at Shiloh Baptist Church [Bennettsville, South Carolina] because in those days there was no place for black people who were without family, and I now know that Reverend Riddick had Alzheimer's [disease] and had no place to go.  He was a minister of great dignity and how we'd all get sent to look for him, but when he had no place to live, my parents began this.  Then my mother built a very modern home for the aged many years after my dad died, and she continued it, and my brother, Julian, who remained at home, continued the home for the aged, which was named after my mother and her - when he died a few years ago, my nieces, Stephanie and Crystal, carried on behind our house as the Maggie L. Bowen Home for the Aged, and it's very moving to me to see many of the old people in our church going there as they make their transition, and it's very moving to me to see my nieces and nephews, my nieces carrying this on, and it's right next to the church and our house where I was born, the original parsonage, which is where the Children's Defense Fund office is, all there so that sense of community and continuity remains.
Speaker 1: That's very impressive.
Speaker 2: It is impressive.
Speaker 1: It doesn't happen that way.
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you, if you get any two Wright children together and if we all get together, and we all have Thanksgiving in Bennettsville, and we try to bring in more and more cousins now because we're doing very conscious oral history with tapes to put some of this together, you know, we sit there, and we'll talk about our mother and our father and about our history so that - and it's very important for me to weave my own children and the new generation of children, and we're so proud of so many of our next generation, but that sense of family cohesion is crucial.
Story_ID: 17646
Speaker 1: And you were the youngest.  What were you like as a child?  How would you sort of describe yourself?  I mean were you a typical youngest child?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know what a typical youngest child is, but I sure learned that I had to survive.  I was, I think, a six year after the fact.  My older four siblings were very close to each other and were all born within a short period of time, and here I came, six years behind.  I think it's an accident.  My brother, Julian, got up about six or seven years ago to introduce me, and it's pretty clear he's never forgiven me for being born, had never forgiven me for being born because he was the kingpin, and then here comes this child, and obviously it was almost like being the only child for many years.  In some ways I felt sad that I didn't know a lot of the history, as we now talk about it, with my sister [Olive] and with my older brothers, but they did.  I did not know Grandma Rachel or Aunt Aura, who were much a part of their lives, but in many ways I had lots of one-on-one time with parents.  I went everywhere that they went.  I was kind of, you know, very much the adopted child of the community.  I literally did go everywhere my mother [Maggie Leola Bowen Wright] and father [Reverend Arthur Jerome Wright, Sr.] went, and it was through just that being there and being the minister's youngest child that, I think, influenced me in many ways, and in some ways I feel like I'm the oldest child as well as the youngest child, and I certainly learned to be a survivor with three older brothers.  There's twelve years between my sister and myself.  There's twelve years between me and my sister's oldest daughter, but I learned with three brothers to hold my own, and one of the things that was very unusual about our family was the partnership between my mother and my father.  It was very clear my father was a teacher-preacher, never raised his voice on the pulpit, appealed to the heart, but he also appealed to the mind and was just a very quiet servant leader, and if other people had talents that could shine, we were always told to let them shine and to not always be out there hogging the limelight, but he lived that.  He really was quite extraordinary, as I look back at it, in the consistency of his faith and the importance of homework.  I happen to have many, many letters that he wrote during that period, many of his earlier sermons which I've run across, which is why I'm very eager to get the Tobin archives and to learn more about that side of him and his friendship with Reverend [Lucius M.]Tobin, but my mother was an incredibly gifted organizer.  She raised the money.  She ran the church [Shiloh Baptist Church, Bennettsville, South Carolina].  She was the church organist.  She began the mothers' club, and they were building a new church in the early days after a fire had taken the old church, and there are wonderful church records of my mother going out to raise enough money to kind of get the next set of bricks to build it up.  The other thing that was very cute in those church records was how we had many master craftsmen in our church, Mr. Pierce Reese and some of the great brick masons and some of the great carpenters, but how they apprenticed children, and my brothers and other children in the community were paid their five cents or ten cents to work along with them and to learn those skills and again this mentorship.  I mean the church was really a leadership development institution, but she was a very - she was never without a penny, never without an idea, put on extraordinary fund-raising events, mobilized the women in the community from the mothers' clubs to the circles, would do great, fun things like all-male weddings, Tom Thumb weddings, baby contests, pack the church to the rafters, but she was the engine behind that, and he recognized those gifts, I mean those partnerships, and I think in many ways I never, as a girl in a - or my sister and I, as women, in this five-sibling family ever were made to think that we weren't as smart as our brothers, that we weren't expected to exceed as much as our brothers, and that kind of high expectations for boys and girls I now know was quite unusual.  I'm often told that I was standing behind the hedge when my sister, who is very gifted and went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], and was teaching at Benedict [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina], after teaching for two years at an all girls, black girls' college down in Beaufort [South Carolina], Mather Academy [Mather Industrial School, Beaufort, South Carolina], decided she was gonna get married, and she was - I don't know - twenty-three years old or twenty-four years old and had only been out working, teaching for three years, and I remember my father, as I hid behind the hedge, being so disappointed, the disappointment in his voice that she would be thinking about getting married before she had used her education more, and it clearly stuck with me, and it didn't occur to me to get married until after I had made more of a contribution to the world, but he really valued his girls as well as his boys and had no double standards, and the partnership between the marriage and the church and in the community, I think, stuck with us all so we always thought we could everything.
Story_ID: 17647
Speaker 1: Do you know where that came from because it is very - it is unbelievable?  I'm the oldest of four girls.  I was treated that way, but I think it was because my father never had a son.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) That's interesting.
Speaker 1: You know, I'm wondering what do you think?  You don't know why in many ways?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I don't know why.  I mean I think some of it - my sense is, and I don't know her and I'd like to, but that my Grandmother Rachel clearly was somebody who was much beloved and relied upon and whether this strong tradition of women.  It was also clear that Aunt Cora and Aunt Alice who - I just have strong recollections of strong women and the more and more I hear about Great-grandma Isabella [Pudegan] and that streak in my mother [Maggie Leola Bowen Wright], because my recollection is of my grandmother, whom I used to see most times as kind of a princess and being very dependent on Great-grandpa - on Grandpa Bowen, but somehow the streak of independence and the fact that that generation of my mother's mother and her sisters were all educated and I now know at good private schools, but clearly there was something that came through.  I mean someone just told me about Great-grandma Isabella having all of her babies by herself on the floor with very little labor.  I mean she was just somebody who kind of did it, and I think that that kind of thing kind of gets in the blood, and it just never occurred to my mother, who in many ways - the one time I did see my father try to squash her ambitions was when she started her own dairy, but she would always have her dollar.  I mean it would never occur to me not to have my own dime or to be able to kind of make it or to not have two ideas about what the next step is, but she was just an organizational genius, and clearly it came from something way back there, and the more and more I hear about Great-grandma Isabella, I think that maybe there was a lot there.
Story_ID: 17648
Speaker 1: Do you think your father - was it the typical Baptist tradition because it doesn't sound like that?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  He was just - I mean, my father [Reverend Arthur Jerome Wright, Sr.], now the more and more I think about him, just extraordinary.  I mean he read.  He thought.  You know, he was clearly very much affected by the war [World War I], but he was also very much affected by his parents [Arthur Eames Wright and Rachel Wright] and believed very deeply in family, believed - I mean my memories of him.  I mean he used to make me read with him every evening, and there were always books, and education was always there, but it was always education to give back and to leave the world better, and even when we didn't have a whole lot of stuff, you know, he would buy us the complete set of 'Abraham Lincoln' by [Carl] Sandburg or, you know, the 'Christian Century' [magazine], and other things.  They were always, both of them, keeping up on the latest literature.  In my mother's case, it was church music or the latest things that were going on with church women, but boy, I now understand that we were just extraordinarily blessed with two parents who were intelligent, who were committed, who believed in education, and who, you know, shared that with the community so people often ask why did you do what you do?  I said it never occurred to me not to do what I do because that is the example that I saw day in and day out, serving the poor, trying to live the Gospel, and they've never let us down.  They were always who we thought they were.  They spoke the truth.  They tried to live the truth, and you try to live up to those expectations.
Story_ID: 17649
Speaker 1: So were there other - was this the church in the community?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had the biggest Baptist church, Shiloh [Shiloh Baptist Church, Bennettsville, South Carolina], but right across the street was St. Michael's Methodist Church, and my sister married a Methodist, and it was so interesting to see her begin to go there, and here when she moved to Washington [D.C.], she joined Asbury Methodist Church, though she's back home at Shiloh, but I think we've always been pretty ecumenical.  We used to go Vacation Bible School at my Baptist church, and then I'd walk across the street and go to St. Michael's Methodist Church, and there were - but it was the most prominent black Baptist church, and again I think because it was such a hub of existence, there was no other church back then that so engaged the community and was such a hub of community life and such a place for children to find alternatives to the segregated community, and my father [Reverend Arthur Jerome Wright, Sr.], I think, had more education than most of the preachers, and he stayed there longer, and if you stay in one place, which is why I think maybe I have great staying power, he stayed - that was his only parish for twenty-five years, and then my mother [Maggie Leola Bowen Wright] stayed there for another.  She lived there another twenty years with my brother [Reverend Harry Starks Wright] as minister, and I look at his foresight because when he built a new educational building which is named after him, the Arthur Wright Educational Building, and a new parsonage, he anticipated that, you know, he might die one day, but he moved the old parsonage, which is where I - which is what I owned and where the Children's Defense Fund's office is, so that my mother would have a place to go.  Even if he knew his child was coming behind him, he knew the need for both my mother and my brother to be independent, and so I just - I look back at his prescience, and I read his sermons, and I can just repeat them today, and they are as fresh and as relevant.  It really is amazing.  It's amazing.  I often tell the story of cleaning out our house after my mother died, and boy, were they - didn't throw away anything, and I went under the beds and found loads of articles on teenage pregnancy, all the issues that the Children's Defense Fund was working on then, and the most eerie was going out on the back porch and going through old Christian Centuries ['Christian Century' magazine], and I had been so proud that I had found a quote from President [Dwight D.] Eisenhower, which is on the Children's Defense Fund poster, about every warship that is launched is a theft from those who are hungry and not fed, but when I was cleaning out, I saw in the back of our freezer a 'Christian Century' turned back to that page, underlined by my father, of that exact Eisenhower quote, and so somehow there is a piece of my life that I kind of feel that you're kind of walking and playing your role in a drama that has always been written, and - but it's really - it's quite wonderful, and it's also quite scary.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Story_ID: 17650
Speaker 1: What was the young Marian like?  What were you like as a child?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  You probably ought to talk to my siblings.  I guess I was always a big dreamer.  I'm very private and very much like silence and having chances to be alone, and one of the things I value very much from my childhood is that I had lots of time in the community and interaction with adults, and I've always been very comfortable with a wide range of adults, and my daddy used to say "you know, there's nobody too lowly.  I mean you can't look down at anybody, and there is no service that is too lowly", and so I find I am most comfortable with people who are without pretension and who - there's just nobody, I mean, because he was very clear about each person being sacred in the sight of God, but I used to have long, luxurious days in the summer of just being able to read and be alone and being able to walk and being able to kind of daydream, and while there were planned activities, it was more kind of the ability to kind of think, be with oneself, and again some of that was fostered by my father [Reverend Arthur Jerome Wright, Sr.] who had a study, who used to go off for long hours to study and to read and to think, and when I am at my worst is when I don't have space to kind of be silent and to be able to think and to read and to pray and to meditate, and people don't value that enough, it's very hard to find because there's so much noise.  It's very hard to be silent, but - so my childhood was one of kind of lots of adults around but also lots of space to wander, for wonder and to wander, and to be on one's own.  I remember going many summers with my parents, who used to go every year to the Hampton Institute for Ministers [later Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and for music, but I was left to wander around Hampton's campus and to wander along the seashores and to - you know, you heard the preaching, you heard the singing, but I would have whole days when I could just kind of be, and that kind of space and that kind of independence and the ability to kind of be with - be alone without being lonely, I think, is something that all of us had growing up because of that, the way in which I think our lives were organized.
Speaker 1: What did you daydream about?  (unclear-off camera voice)
Speaker 2: Oh, I dreamed about lots of things because one of the things that was clear in my family was that there was injustice in the world, and we talked about it, and we talked about how you overcome that, and you talked about struggling, and so all of it was around how you can make a difference in this world, and obviously like any other black kid growing up in a segregated South, I absolutely hated any boundaries on me.  I hated being told I couldn't do something or go anywhere, and so I don't remember a time when I was not dreaming about how one was going to change that and change injustice when we saw a lot of unfairness.  We saw a lot of unjust deaths, preventable deaths with children from sewerage and from unsafe playing places, from, you know, unavailable healthcare, and you know, life and death were inextricably intertwined, but you know, you're also always there with people who took it in stride, who kept going, and it wasn't just my parents.  It was this sense of community ownership of children and incredible community women, many of whom were quite educated, and back then we had a corps of very well-educated teachers who were married to the dentists and others, and we had these wonderful women like Miss Tee [Theresa] Kelly and Miss Kate Winston who did not have a lot of education, and they were all of one accord.  I mean I have wonderful photos of them, and they were great friends, and we all visited their houses, and so, again, this strength of women who clearly were the backbone of the community was something that I think I just kind of inculcated and - but all of them evidenced a sense of service and a sense of can-do, which is what our children too often are missing today.
Story_ID: 17651
Speaker 1: When he [your father, Reverend Arthur Jerome Wright, Sr.] passed away, that must have been a trying time since he was such a pillar.  How did that affect you?
Speaker 2: Well, it obviously was quite extraordinary, and on the other hand I think I now know in retrospect that in some ways he prepared us.  I mean the Sunday he preached his last sermon, which is on the 139th Psalm [from the Bible], you know, in a sense told us that he was going to die or go away, but we needn't be afraid, and there was no place you could go where God was not, and I remember running out of church and going up to his study and saying you're going to die, and he said it's okay,  don't be afraid, and he was gone by the end of that week, but again the courage and the preparation and the ability to say that God is here and the dignity with which he died and being very clear to me.  I went up to the hospital with him in the ambulance, and it was "get your education".  "Get your education".  "Okay, but get your education".  Even in an ambulance that was kind of the thing that he continued to stress, and I was in the room with him when he died and the peacefulness and the preparation because if you've lived a good life, it was okay, and with my mom [Maggie Leola Bowen Wright] in many ways the same way so I felt very fortunate, both in the example about how my parents lived but the ways in which they died, and obviously one tried to live up to his expectations in many ways, and he is still the pacesetter for all of us as we make judgments about what we will do and will not do.
Speaker 1: I read that you had wanted to go to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and not Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  How did that decision come?  I mean who - obviously someone went out, but why - just explain to me, you know, what happened.
Speaker 2: Well, if my father had lived, I probably would have gone to Fisk because I had sought early admission to Fisk, and my sister [Olive] had gotten to Fisk, and I loved the tradition of Fisk and the Jubilee Singers and the fact that Anna Bond Thompson and John Hope Franklin and so many very distinguished blacks had gone.  It was very glamorous, Fisk, and it was near Meharry Medical School [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], and every black child, girl, back then dreamed of nabbing a doctor, but my sister had gone there, and then my father died, and I was fourteen or fifteen.  I'm just turning fifteen, and my mother really didn't want me to leave home that early and didn't want me to go so far to Nashville [Tennessee], and she was not as, I think, cutting edge in challenging segregation.  I think if my father lived, I would have applied to go to a white school, but my mother simply wasn't ready to have me leave home, and then the question was, you know, here do you go?  Reverend [Lucius M.] Tobin, my godfather, my father's best friend, was in Atlanta [Georgia] teaching at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] offered a pretty good package.  The debate that I remembered was between my brothers, my older brother, Arthur [Arthur Jerome Wright, Jr.], and my mother, as to whether a black girl who was fairly white should go to a desegregated college or go to an all-black college, but whatever it is, my mother and my brother, Harry [Reverend Harry Starks Wright], who had gone to Morehouse, prevailed.  Spelman was nearer.  I was still pretty young, sixteen and a half.  You know, Tobin was there, and it was a ladymaking school, very strict, and that made my mother comfortable, and I'd grown up in this nice cocoon in some ways in Bennettsville [South Carolina], but for whatever reason I went off to Spelman but with a fair amount of resentment because I did not want to be cooped up in a womens' college, had had my heart set of Fisk, but boy, am I glad I didn't go to Fisk, and I'm so glad I went to Atlanta.

Speaker 1: So how was that experience once you got - you know, you were sent there sort of kicking and screaming, but what was the experience once you got there?
Speaker 2: Well, a little rocky freshman year because I really was rebelling.  I did not study as hard.  I mean, you had to be in by 5:30.  You had to go off campus in groups of threes, and my first semester I was really kind of dealing with the fact that I didn't want to be there, and with all of Spelman's [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] restrictions, including compulsory chapel at 8:00 every morning and compulsory prayer meeting on Wednesdays and chapel on Sunday afternoons, and I remember sneaking off campus and getting caught and being hauled in to Eugenia Dunn's, the Dean of Students' office and who seemed to me back then like a battle-ax.  She's now just - I remember her - she's no longer alive - with great fondness, but she just looked at me strictly in the air as she campus-bound me for longer than I thought was fair for having snuck to go off to the movies, about the fact that to them to whom much is given, much is expected, and so after that first semester I kind of shaped up and began to excel, and that paid off with a fellowship to go to study abroad in my sophomore year, which allowed me to leave Atlanta [Georgia] for my junior year, but the other things that were blessings to me at Spelman was that Howard Zinn came to be Chairman of the History Department.  He's the author of the 'People's History of the United States' and many other books, but he came as Chairman of the History Department in that freshman year, and there were a couple of other teachers who did not fit the mold of the safe traditional teacher at Spelman, and so I had great fun.  Then there was Dr. Mays [Benjamin E. Mays, President, Morehouse College] because I got to sing in the Morehouse-Spelman [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] Choir and go over there every Sunday morning, and Wendell Whalum was one of the great, great musicians at the time, but getting to hear Dr. Mays and other great speakers every Sunday morning at Morehouse and then hearing the good speakers who came through Sisters Chapel so it - and Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr.] was very much a part of our lives.  His mother and his sister, Christine, were Spelman people, and so the atmosphere and the climate in Atlanta and the leaders that came through and the compulsory chapel which I rebelled about I remember now far more than any of the classes, other than the classes that Zinn and other questioning teachers, who taught us to question rather than to accept the status quo, gave us, and the first thing I did when I became Chair of the Spelman Board many, many years later when compulsory chapel had been abolished was to reinstitute it at least once a month because I realized that young people don't get a chance to hear what adults think is important, and so I've been trying to get back some of those traditions.
Story_ID: 17653
Speaker 1: So what happened at chapel then?  Was it a religious service or was it?
Speaker 2: Chapel was a religious service.  You sang hymns.  You also sang spirituals.  We had a great choir.  We had people like Howard Thurman, some of the great speakers of the day, and Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr.], come through, the first time I heard Dr. King, and it connected us through spirituals with our past.  It connected us through great preachers and great teachers with what was important in life, and that was service.  I mean imagine the Dr. Mayses [Benjamin E. Mays, President, Morehouse College] and the Rufus Clements [Rufus E. Clement, President, Atlanta University] and all them coming.  Whitney Young was then the Dean of the School of Social Work at Atlanta University [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  Carl Holden was teaching at Clark [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and so we got to hear some of the great people and great minds, and so it was the spiritual preparation.  It was the education of the heart and of the soul that was complemented by the education of the mind, and those things are crucially important, and I worry so much about the lack of spiritual formation that is going on on many of our black and white campuses today, about the lack of exposure to great leaders who have a context of values to offer and that put education in a context that's beyond kind of individual achievement, and I worry about that fact that some of our young people don't know their stories, don't know their history, and that's not being taught on too many black campuses as well as white campuses, and that's one of the reasons we started Haley Farm [run by the Children's Defense Fund, Clinton, Tennessee] was to see how we could begin to reweave that sense of history, teach young people their stories, let them understand that they are empowered to change things, let them hear examples of children and others who change things because they're not getting it, and that's why they don't know how to struggle and keep at something, and that's been robbing them of what I consider their important birthright.
Speaker 1: But that was also an interesting time, too, because you were, you know, in a place of which - you know, exposure and of time, the '50s [1950s].  I think that was an interesting good time.
Speaker 2: The '50s [1950s], '60s [1960s] was just at the nascent period of the civil rights movement.  The Montgomery [Alabama] boycott, that was right after Brown [Brown vs. Board of Education].  There was a sense of expectancy, and while the majority of people were still happy with the status quo, there was a rumbling underneath, and we had been given permission to think about building a new world thanks to Brown and the incredible brilliance and planning, which I was very aware of because my daddy [Reverend Arthur Jerome Wright, Sr.] was waiting with me to see Brown come down every Monday morning, and he died the Monday before it did come down, but it was something that was very much a part of our consciousness, and I was very conscious of the effort and the courage of the black parents and the brilliant black lawyers who were planning that, and again all of this feeds in to understanding that transforming change is possible, but it takes a lot of individuals working for a long period of time to achieve it.
Story_ID: 17654
Speaker 1: So you were a history major?
Speaker 2: I ended up majoring in social science with a lot of work in international relations, thanks to the year I spent at the Sorbonne [France] and the University of Geneva [Switzerland], but Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] didn't offer a major in international relations so I majored in social science and minored in English, and all three of my children are history majors.
Speaker 1: How did that year abroad come about?
Speaker 2: My friend, Charles Merrill, who founded the Commonwealth School [Boston, Massachusetts] and who was the son of the founder of Merrill Lynch [financial management company], had been impressed when he was in the army by men who were at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and he wondered about this Morehouse College, and who was this Dr. Mays [Benjamin E. Mays, President, Morehouse College], and when he got out of the army, he came and visited and got very much engaged in Morehouse and became the Chairman of Morehouse's Board of Trustees and set up Merrill Scholarships, fellowships for travel and study abroad, a year-long thing, and that began the year before I went to Spelman, and it started with Morehouse, and then he extended it to one Spelman student in my freshman year who was a linguist, and happily in that second year he decided to do two at Spelman, and I was one of the lucky two, thanks to the nomination of Howard Zinn, and Howard Zinn did a second thing that was so important to me.  Unlike the previous Spelman recipient of the Merrill Fellowship who went off in a group, and there were the Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts] groups and the Sweet Briar [Sweet Briar College, Sweet Briar, Virginia] groups, he said no, go on your own, and that was unthinkable in a place like Spelman, but I'm so grateful because I learned that I could navigate my way around the world and make my own decisions, and it prepared me for a lot that came in the future.
Story_ID: 17655
Speaker 1: After you - so you graduate.  You come back from - was that a junior year?
Speaker 2: A junior year abroad.  I came back in my senior year, which was 1960, and that was the year of the sit-ins, and that was, you know, absolutely wonderful.  When A and T [sit-down demonstrations at Woolworth's lunch counter, Greensboro, North Carolina] happened, we were all waiting to figure out what we were going to do, and so with Julian Bond and a few others we all sat down in the corner, plotted, and with Howard Zinn's help we planned the sit-ins, carried them out over the opposition of our college presidents and many of our teachers but with the support of a key number, and they were flawless.  I look back at it, and that was the thing that determined that I would go to law school, which it had never occurred for me to do, but I was volunteering at the local NAACP  [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] after the sit-in movement, and I sat in at the City Hall, and I didn't go back to the City Hall from 1960 until I went back when the Democratic [political] Convention was in Atlanta [Georgia], and Andy Young [Andrew Young, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations] was the mayor of the city, and it showed you again how much change was possible, but that got me volunteering for the NAACP and seeing how many poor people, black people were filing complaints, couldn't get lawyers because white lawyers didn't take civil rights cases, and if they didn't have the money to pay, they couldn't get a lawyer, and that made me wonder what in the world I was thinking about, going back abroad or trying to go into the Foreign Service so the sit-in movement and the civil rights movement and the formation of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] in 1960 all were the determining factors in the next stage of my life, which has led to my work now.
Story_ID: 17656
Speaker 1: So how did Yale Law School [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] come about?  That was a time - that's still a period where not even just black women, but women, period, were, you know, few in numbers, and I'm just wondering how that happened?
Speaker 2: I have no idea why I decided to apply to Yale Law School.  It was the only law school I applied to, and I said if I got in, I'd go because law school had really simply - I got mad one day with a particularly bad complaint, and I think it was serendipitous that I picked Yale because it was a small law school that was really much more interested in social policy.  I don't know if I could have survived at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but I got in, and I went and had no idea what law school was like.  There were - we had the largest number of women.  I think there were nine of us in that opening class.  You would have thought they were being raided by Attila the Hun's hordes, but I was, again, blessed with good support, even though women couldn't live in the dormitories, and we had a segregated hall, Helen Hadley Hall.  There were a group of black women who were a wonderful network, and a group of friends, like Donald Stewart, who were in graduate school who remained - and became President of Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] later on - who remain friends for life, and then I ran into Bill Coffin [Reverend William Sloane Coffin], the activist chaplain, with whom I lived for a year, but I was also very guilty that my friends had gone off to Mississippi and so tried to go and visit, but while I hated law school, the notion of being able to be an instrument for change in the South is what kept me there, but it was an interesting experience.  Now the law school, like many law schools, are almost half women, and things have changed a lot, and while I still look forward to never reading another case, it gave one a way of thinking and understanding the world and how the world is shaped in many ways that has proved very invaluable in speaking up both for the disenfranchised and for children.
Speaker 1: And you left and then you went to work in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I finished Yale Law School, having spent a summer in Crossroads Africa in Africa, and I have then gone down to Mississippi at the beginning to visit my SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] friends, and the first time the police dogs were brought out in Greenwood [Mississippi], and that made me determined I was going go to Mississippi, and I spent a year in New York at the Legal Defense Fund, being trained by them, and that was very exciting, and at the end of 1963 - in fact, I got out of law school in time to write the briefs for the sit-in cases from 1960, which included - affected me and my own arrest, which told me a lot about how slow the law can be, but then I went down in the spring of 1964 in anticipation of the summer project of 1964 and set up offices in Memphis [Tennessee] with Mr. [Z. Alexander] Looby and Russell Sugarman to service the kids in northern Mississippi and open up an office in Jackson [Mississippi] and to work with the three black lawyers who were then practicing law in Mississippi, and that was when I got out of law school which were wonderful mentors, and then I moved to Mississippi in May and June of 1964 to get ready to run a legal factory to keep the movement going during the summer project of '64 [1964] so one could not have asked for a more exciting time.
Story_ID: 17657
Speaker 1: And that's why you studied and took the bar exam.
Speaker 2: That's why I studied, but I had to stay in Mississippi for fiften months under the fiction that I was the law clerk for the three local lawyers because Mississippi had a fifteen months' residence requirement to keep outside lawyers out, and as you know, many segregated universities didn't take black students, and they wouldn't pay for out-of-state educations, and if you went to Ole Miss Law School [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi], which didn't admit blacks back then, you were automatically admitted to the bar, but if you did not go to Ole Miss Law School, you had to wait for fifteen months, live in the state, not practice law, and take a bar exam for which there were no bar examination courses so I was, in effect, the law clerk for the three lawyers, but I did all the work that ran the offices, but I had to have one of the male lawyers go into court with me under the pretension that I really was not practicing law, and after fifteen months I did take the bar exam, and happily, because of a Harvard Law School [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate who was a clerk for the notoriously segregationist judge, Judge [William H.] Cox, named Ed Wright, he lent me his bar notes because I was told that you could be asked to quote any part of the entire statutes in Mississippi.  You're supposed to know them by heart, but since he had gone to the bar exam, I then learned which fifty or 100 statutes you're most likely to be called upon and what the most likely questions are so that it was just, you know, through lots of different ways I was able to take the bar, get in, and then stayed.
Speaker 1: That sounds very significant.
Speaker 2: You then left and worked on (unclear)?
Speaker 1: I practiced law in Mississippi for a number of years, but in 1964 was when we had the big voter registration project, and then we had the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Challenge, and then everybody - the volunteers went home, and I was left with hundreds and hundreds of cases, and we had used a process called federal removal which [Anthony G.] Tony Amsterdam and other brilliant lawyers, just to keep the process going, had invented, but then I had to try these cases.  They were sent back to state courts to settle them, but then how are people going to live because as a result of the voter registration, many sharecroppers were being pushed off the plantations, didn't have anywhere to live, and the War on Poverty was started here in Washington [D.C.], and in 1965 the state of Mississippi refused to apply for Head Start [program, U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity] funds, and there was a provision in the statute that if the state didn't want to do it, then private groups could, and so with churches and others we applied and got the largest Head Start Program in the nation, and I became general counsel for that, and Senator Stennis [John C. Stennis, U.S. Senate, Mississippi] immediately attacked it, and he understood correctly that 3,000 new jobs, free of the plantation and state system, was revolutionary.  Black parents got a new vision of what their children could get, and Head Start was the most exciting thing, but then I learned about the politics of all of this, that Sargent Shriver [Director, Office of Economic Opportunity], when threatened by Senator Stennis that he wouldn't get the OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] program reauthorized, cut off the child development group, and so I found myself lobbying and spending a lot of time, but secondly, I had a lot of school desegregation cases, and I found that my job didn't stop when I won the decree if the next day my clients were out of a job or out of a house, were being treated violently, that freedom of choice really wasn't free, that, you know, you had to pay more attention to the social economic aspects of it so, you know, the seeds of the Children's Defense Fund really rested in that '65 [1965], '66 [1966], '67 [1967] period of fighting to enforce the laws on behalf of those for whom it was intended, and secondly, understanding that if you didn't deal with poverty and health care and the quality of education, that our job wasn't done, and so I was spending a lot of time in Washington trying to keep the Head Start Program alive against political attacks but also understanding that you had to implement laws as well as pass them so in anticipation of the Poor People's Campaign because hunger was widespread in Mississippi, the need for jobs was obvious, I began to think about moving to Washington and Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had agreed to do it, and Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy, U.S. Senate, New York] had come to hold hearings, and so I moved here in 1968 to get ready for the Poor People's Campaign and have remained here ever since.
Story_ID: 17658
Speaker 1: This whole thing to start the Children's Defense Fund [Washington, D.C.] was really a non-legal - I mean it was your role because up to this point, your role had been pretty much a legal role, and I'm just wondering, you know?
Speaker 2: But I never was a narrow lawyer.  I always considered myself a community and policy lawyer because I know both the values and the limits of litigation.  I know that passing a law can often be hard, but it's also the easiest part of it.  How do you make it work?  How do you translate it into the lives of children, and so that experience and the Mississippi experience about the community made it very clear to me that one had to take a broad view so I never was a lawyer to spend a lot of time in the office because I wrote my briefs, but I spent most of my time out in communities trying to improve people's lives, and that led me to try to do it on a larger scale by moving to Washington [D.C.], by having a Poor People's Campaign, by trying to move to the next stage, and for the last thirty-three years since Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died, have been trying to put into place the research, the strategies, the models, the identification of the networks that can move the civil rights movement to the next phase, which is health care for everybody, which is child care of good quality, which is education.  The urban schools and rural schools in Mississippi and around are a scandal, and so it's dealing with the substantive civil rights.  That was always evident to me, even as early as '65 [1965], that people had to eat after they sort of tried to vote so you had to address those broader issues.
Story_ID: 17659
Speaker 1: And what are the things that you're most proud of that you accomplished in these thirty-some years, I mean when you look at it?  I know that you say you never would have thought, you know, getting child - I mean getting health care would have been so difficult so I'm just wondering?
Speaker 2: We have a framework of laws that did not exist.  You know, millions of children who are disabled go to school every day.  We take it for granted.  We still have a lot of problems in special education, and people misuse it, but there's a law that's [Public Law] 94142 that became the Individuals With Disabilities Act [1975].  That's something that our first report on children out of school that showed that disabled children didn't have a right to education.  Now we changed that, and millions of lives have been affected.  We kept children from being put in jails with adults, and we're fighting to keep that, but there's a new law that is a framework.  We have expanded health care for millions, Head Start [program] for millions.  Adoption laws and child welfare laws have been reformed, and so we can look back, and there are many laws that never existed that are there.  Secondly, when we started, I think there were - the word advocacy and child advocacy was not in the lexicon, and there were very few local groups where children are now at the top of national debate.  Many, many hundreds and thousands, indeed, of people who call - who have groups and organizations call themselves child advocates.  Many organizations are gradually beginning to understand that if you're going to address these issues, you need to start with children and families and address the substantive issues.  I think we - you know, we've issued hundreds and hundreds of reports that have defined the needs of children and solutions to those needs, and thousands and thousands of advocates are now part of that, and the fact that we could get up to 1996 and in four months get 250 or 300,000 people to show up without celebrities to address the needs of children and to translate that the next year into the Child Health Insurance Program to help working families after we lost the income safety net that is $48,000,000,000 and to giving working families health care, and here we are now trying to write the biggest law in our lives to put everything we've learned over the last thirty-three years into the act to leave no child behind, but here we have the President of the United States [George W. Bush] using our trademark mission statement to leave no child behind in his daily work.  Now the chore is how do you build the movement to make him do it?  And how do you get people now just not to use children as photo ops and as nice slogans, but because they don't vote and don't lobby and don't make contributions, how do we really get something done for children?  How do we get the black community and the white community to deal with our hypocrisy of talking about families and talking about children, but boy, when it comes to doing the hard work on lobbying for the budget or challenging tax policies, that's hard work, and so the next ten years, I think, are the most important in trying to now translate all that we know works for children into humane, well-crafted policies and practices that are funded and of high quality for all children.  I think the other thing that I would say I'm very proud of is what we've been able to achieve through the Black Community Crusade for Children which has been below the radar screen because like my daddy [Reverend Arthur Jerome Wright, Sr.], we don't - you get more things done in Washington [D.C.] if you do the work and let other people take the credit, and a lot - if you look now, the number of black organizations as well as white organizations that address children, more and more and more people are putting children at the top of their agenda, the National Urban League and Hugh Price, who's been a part of that.  You see the incredible, wonderfully gifted emerging leaders who are on our board, Jeff Canaday at the Rheedlen Centers for Children [later the Harlem Children's Zone, Inc., New York], Angela Blackwell.  These are people who are doing the complex work of building the next movement for children, which is not so easy to define as in the '60s [1960s] and requires, you know, very complicated policy analysis but at the same time sophistication about the new technologies and communications, but at the same time building community networks, and Haley Farm [in Clinton, Tennessee] - we bought Alex Haley Farm, in a sense to try to train a successive generation of children to reweave the fabric of leadership and of community across faith and race and income and age.  We have trained over 5,000 black college students.  Every summer, this coming summer, there will be sixty freedom schools based on very thoughtful reading curriculum, I mean conflict resolution manned by college students.  We'll graduate 600 of them at commencement this year.  Jonathan Kozol is the commencement speaker.  We're bringing together all kinds of people to talk about how they can rebuild community, give them the skills they need and over the next few years taking the vision that is laid out in this complicated bill that we have been drafting and working with the Hill [Capitol Hill] to get introduced to tell Mr. Bush [President George W. Bush] and to tell members of Congress what it means to leave no child behind.  We're trying to back that up now with first-rate media and public education campaigns with, you know, very specific mobilization activities, including Wednesdays in Washington and back home, building on the Wednesdays in Mississippi that Miss [Dorothy] Height and Polly Cowan and the National Council of Negro Women did in the '60s [1960s].  Well, we want to do the twenty-first century version of that and really begin to have a witness of presence every Wednesday at home and back, tied to this vision of leaving no child behind, and lastly, it doesn't do any good to pass the laws if you don't have dedicated servant leaders, and what has disturbed me a lot is how this country has gone crazy over celebrity and fame and money, and too many of our black young people and black leaders have bought in to the false idols of American materialism.  How do we create a new sense of service and a redefinition of success so the Haley Farm programs and trying to prepare the new generation for the new century with some of the older values that don't go away - faith and fairness and justice and service - is, I think, the most important work ahead of us.
