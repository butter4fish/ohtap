Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers archive.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Paul Lamine Jupiter Gueye, Paul, P-A-U-L, Lamine, L-A-M-I-N-E, Jupiter, J-U-P-I-T-E-R, and Gueye, last name, G-U-E-Y-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is there an accent or anything in there?
Speaker 2: Yes, grave, accent grave, so it's tilted to the back towards the 'G' on the first 'E' [Gueye].  On the first 'E'. Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what is your--now, is there a--I always ask this when I hear, when there's an unusual name, and this is unusual for the United States.  So I just want to ask you, like is there a story behind your name?  Is there a--I know we've all heard Paul.  We know where that's from, but the rest of it, even Jupiter is something that's unusual.  So is there a story behind these names?
Speaker 2: Jupiter is actually my dad's name, my dad's first name.  I was named after one of my uncle from the family, actually, more for a very good friend, and also my last name is actually very common in Senegal.  I didn't do a study on that, but I found out a few years ago that actually it was attached to some kings a while back, so, which of course, excited my daughter because now she can claim that she's a princess (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, is there a meaning for Lamine?
Speaker 2: Lamine is also part of the way we name kids in my country.  Of course, it depends on which ethnic you are, but in my family we actually use middle names and first names based on either a family member or a very good friend.  So Lamine is also part of, it's a very good friend of the family actually, more than good friends, it's one of my great grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, is there a meaning to this name 'cause I know often names in Africa have a meaning that is beyond just--I mean here, it's just a sound in a lot of ways.  There are some meanings, but we don't really realize it, what was intended.
Speaker 2: I would say, yes, but I don't know.  I haven't did any studies on those.  So I cannot really tell about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, the same with Gueye?
Speaker 2: The same as Gueye, yes.  As I mentioned, I mean the further I trace it back, it looks like we are coming from a king family.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what culture from Senegal is that, is your name?
Speaker 2: You find them, we are--my family is coming mainly from Saint-Louis which was actually the capital of Senegal before Dakar became [the capital city of Senegal].  So we're coming from there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, is there a, what we used to call tribal links or national--I mean groups of specific ethnic groups, I mean what specific ethnic group are you or does it make any difference?
Speaker 2: Yes, we belong, if my memory is not losing me, I think we belong to the Wolof which is part of, ghee, I think one of the largest ethnic in Senegal.
Speaker 1: And spell that for us.
Speaker 2: W-O-L-O-F.  Of course, this is the French version--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --because there's also another native language.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now do you have any nicknames?
Speaker 2: Yes, my nickname is Petite Paul, "petite" for "little," Paul, and the reason is I have also a twin brother.  His name is Rene [French pronunciation] or Rene [English pronunciation], I guess, in English, and he's also named Little Rene because we have two uncles, Paul and Rene.  So if you said, Paul, come on, we both show up (laughter).  So it was my nickname is Little Paul and my brother's name is Little Rene.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born on July 8, 1966 in Dakar.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date, February 7, I guess, February 8 today, 2012.
Speaker 1: Today, is today the eighth?
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Today's, the eighth [February 8, 2012].  That's correct.
Speaker 2: Eighth, all right, okay.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 1: We are at Hampton University, located in Hampton, Virginia.  And we're in the library, the Hampton Library.
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 20743
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that are supposed to be a warm up, but I think we're already warmed up.  But I'll ask them anyway.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: The first one--and they only require a short answer.  The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: No.  My grandma used to call me trash.  I can eat anything, and I love everything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Home, going back home, so Senegal.
Speaker 1: All right, and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, actually, I'm gonna--I don't know the exact translation or I'd say the proper translation, but it's, Matthew 22, Verse 29.  It [speaking in French].  "You will love others as you love yourself."  And I grew up like this, so that's a sentence I would say that I use a lot--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Speaker 2: --in the way I conduct myself and so forth.
Story_ID: 20744
Speaker 1: All right, now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes, Elisabeth Soumah, E-L-I-S-A-B-E-T-H, and her last name, maiden name, S-O-U-M-A-H, Soumah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born on July 15, and I don't remember the year.  Gee, she's now in the sixties.  I don't remember the exact, yeah, I don't remember the ranking of it now; same with my dad actually now that I'm thinking about it.
Speaker 1: In the '40s, [1940s] I guess.
Speaker 2: She's in the--oh, no, no, no.  She's in the fifty--in the sixties now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but she would be born in the 1940s?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, yes, yes, correct, correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Guinea-Conakry [Republic of Guinea, West Africa; formerly known as French Guinea].  There's two Guineas in Africa [Guinea-Conakry and Guinea-Bissau].  So the one that she was born in is Guinea-Conakry.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we would Conakry, Guinea, but that's the capital of Guinea, right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.  That's Guinea-Bissau and Guinea-Conakry.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: I don't know, didn't do any studies on that either.  It's not something that--I guess it depends on how you grow up, just to make a short parenthesis on that.  If you grow up in the capital which is where I grew up, and depending on your family, we were not really engaged in learning how far back we grew up.  The information is there, but we never really took advantage of that, at least I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you have any--did you know your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Mother's side, actually, yes, knew my great grandmother and my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories about what they did for a living or what they, how they--
Speaker 2: No, they were, I mean when I interacted with them, they were pretty old.  And I love to be able to meet with them.  Towards the end of her life, my grandmother was blind, so she was not also talking a whole lot, but so she didn't have a job per se.  She was mainly at home, so that's all the memories I have from her.
Speaker 1: Okay, were they--was your mother's family raised in the city?
Speaker 2: Yes, in the Guinea-Conakry and a few of her brothers and sisters actually in Europe and Canada.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story about where the family came from before they got to Conakry or are they--just they seemed to have always been in Conakry.
Speaker 2: Again, that's not something that I tried to find out as far as the history of my family, per se, where we came from and where, yeah, where we came from, the great, great, great grandmother or great, great, great grandfathers.
Story_ID: 20745
Speaker 1: Now, this is unusual in the sense of the perspective of African Americans.  We always think that Africans know where they come from, you know, and what their history is.  So it's kind of surprising that there's no--so there's no story about your mother's side at all?
Speaker 2: No, so, African what we--when we grow up, we do learn about our rules as far as Africa as a country and--as a continent and your particular country.  Your geology tree as far as where you come from and so forth, there's more emphasis if you grew up in a village 'cause the tradition is more emphasized over there.  For those who grow up in the city--now, again, it depends on your family, but most of the children will be taught about their parents, their grandparents and uncles because usually they're there.  They're part of the family.  They live under the same roof.  My family was, is one of a few that are slightly different.  What I mean by that, we grew up in the city.  We didn't grow up in the country.  My dad [Jupiter Gueye] and mother [Elisabeth Soumah] divorced also.  So actually, my twin brother and I was raised by my grandmother on my dad's side.  So we never really interacted on a daily basis with our immediate parents.  Okay, so this being said, we obviously loved to visit both parents, and on my mum's side, her parents were in Conakry [Guinea-Conakry/Republic of Guinea, West Africa].  So we were able to meet a few of them.  And why we didn't go to Conakry more often, to Guinea and there's a--something that you're probably aware of, is actually easier to fly from New York to any country on the continent than to fly within the continent or to drive, right.  So it's not something that is automatic.  So we were very content, I would say, in regards to being able to access our mom, access our dad and talk to them, see grandmother and grandfather and so forth.  But we never really, at least I never really sit down and ask, okay, where do we come from?  Why that name and so forth.  I do recall, now that you mention the question that once in a while I remember my mum and my grandparents mentioning some stories.  But they never, they're not there anymore.
Story_ID: 20746
Speaker 1: One of the difference, and that may be one of the reasons that you will also see with other families, a lot of my family members went to college and went to getting into some, I would say middle class or high level professions.  So that means that we also grew up in an environment that is not, I would say the standard compared to some of the other Africans.  So we didn't grow up in a village.  If, 'cause that's typically the, what comes in mind of most of the people when they talk about Africa.  We didn't grow up in a village.  I didn't grow up in a village.  And I grew up with a lot of my uncles, aunts being either lawyers or doctors or teachers.  My mom [Elisabeth Soumah] is a principal in an elementary school, okay.  So we didn't try to find out where we come from or what you want to become because you just go to school and keep going until whenever.  So there was no limit in regards to, I cannot achieve that or I cannot do that.  I want to become this.  It was more, this is interesting and we keeping learning.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 20747
Speaker 1: All right, so, okay, well, let's go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Jupiter Gueye, J-U-P-I-T-E-R, last name, G-U-E-Y-E.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Again, what's interesting is that he was born on the same day as my mum [Elisabeth Soumah], so July 15.  And they were actually married on the same day.  And, again, he was born in the '40s [1940s], but I don't remember exactly the--
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born also in Senegal in Dakar.
Speaker 1: Oh, all right, okay.  All right, what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can go as far as my grandma and my grand dad.  I never met my grand dad, but I did, I grew up with my grandmother who was his mom.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did they do?
Speaker 2: My dad?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, yeah, what did your grandparents do?
Speaker 2: Oh, my granddad was actually a lawyer.  My grandma stayed at home basically, so she raised her kids, about five kids.  And my dad was a principal at a high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there a story about how your grandfather--I mean is there a story in the family about how he became a lawyer or how did he make that--
Speaker 2: For my grandfather--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, sir.
Speaker 2: --no, I don't have, I don't remember a story about how he became a lawyer.  I just knew he was very, very good and a very respectful lawyer in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's no story of the family, of life before the French came over there or anything.  There's no stories like that at all in the family?
Speaker 2: I would not say there is none.  I can't remember one.  Let's put it that way.
Speaker 1: And so people in the family don't talk about that as a general rule or something or what?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Is it considered bad manners to talk about that or something or what?
Speaker 2: As far as what happened before--
Speaker 1: Yeah, before Colonialism?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, not at all. I mean there are lots of--there have been and there still are a lot of discussions about, about Senegal in general, about Africa in general, about slavery, about colonization, about virtually every topic.  As far as our family, yes, some people once in a while talk about some personal experience, or yeah, I remember when granddad was doing this or doing that.  And our grandma also, when she was alive, used to mention a couple of stories as far as what she did with him when he was alive.  But having us sitting around the table and telling us this is where you come from, I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20748
Speaker 1: But this is probably because, again, we are a family that is--, okay, the image that people have for Africa as far as families is, to raise a child, "it takes a village to raise a child," okay.  And growing up in the '60s [1960s] 'cause I was born--I mean '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], I guess, late '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], I noticed something that, again, was slightly different from, at least what I was seeing with other families.  We have very strong ties.  But you find that everywhere.  However, while a lot of families were sometimes torn because of internal issues or, and what not, or you have sometimes people coming from the village and telling you, okay, I come from X village, I was sent by this person.  I'm your cousin or your uncle or whatever.  That happens a lot in Africa and in Senegal as well.  And those people are obviously welcomed as family members.  We didn't have a lot of that.  I don't know why.  But we didn't have--we did have people coming and we always--the door was always open as any other family growing up in Africa.  It doesn't matter who you are, when you ring the bell, the door is always open for you.  But we didn't have that experience, I would say, or--well, let's say experience where there was a lot of unknown people who were coming as, claiming they were family members.  And also we were not, we are not--Africa, Senegal is more than 97 percent Muslim.  And we've got three percent which is a mix of Christians and atheists and everything else.  I'm part of, I'm a Christian, okay.  So I grew up as a Protestant.  So I'm part of the small piece, but I did have family members who were married to Muslims.  Okay, so we have both.  But because we were not fully Muslims, you're gonna see that in some of the Muslim families.  Some of the rules are different because of the religion, the way you think.  Overall, it doesn't matter.  I mean they're all basically behaving roughly the same, but you see some differences that are noticeable.  And we didn't have that exposure.  So that means that all this is to say that this environment that I grew up, it was completely and actually fully open in regards to every aspect of the society, going back as far as you want, okay.  And you could have access to every single story from virtually every member of the family.  But there was not a culture in, which is what you're referring to, where in a village, everybody gather around the tree, around the wisest, the old man or the person that tells stories about where we come from.  We didn't have that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 20749
Speaker 1: I can tell you, for example, that one of my aunt was the first to get a Ph.D. in pharmacy from the university.  She also become--actually, she just got recognized a couple of years ago for that.  She also was the captain of the basketball team.  My dad [Jupiter Gueye] retained a record in track and field for a long time in France.  One of my uncle was in the medical field.  He was a surgeon, and he was also one of the first to achieve some particular, how do I say that--he was recognized overseas and got some award that, for the first time, was awarded to somebody in Senegal, at least in the medical corp.  So, yes, I do have stories, if you will, as far as individual family members doing something unique.  But it's, personally, again, I didn't, I cannot tell you about where we come from as far as going back to our ancestors.  I can have--I didn't pursue to have that, but, yeah--
Speaker 2: Here's a--maybe another angle on this--
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: --now, correct me if I'm wrong, but it would seem that your family has an association with a, probably a specific Christian denomination--
Speaker 1: Protestant.
Speaker 2: --that had--yeah, but what Protestant group?  There's plenty of them, you know.  Which group?
Speaker 1: I think the, it would be Adventist, I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so Seventh Day Adventists, SDA, yeah.  Okay, so SDA, I know has missions that go to Africa, and then so your family was associated more with the SDA, I guess, which would be--and, once again, correct me if I'm wrong, this would be very important in a country that's predominantly Muslim to be attached to a specific denomination, with a specific link to training and education and that sort of thing.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Yes, and no.  Before I start, what does SDA stand for?
Speaker 2: Seventh Day Adventists.
Speaker 1: Okay, so one of the, what you're gonna find again, yes, there's a lot of Muslims.  But we're not classified as a Muslim country as far as like--.  So one of the thing that happened and I've found very fascinating which I didn't find in other countries, at least where I went to, is that it doesn't matter what your beliefs are, okay.  It may matter in some families.  I'm not gonna mention that this is across the board, but for all of the France and people that I've been acquainted to, you're Muslim, you're Catholic, you're Protestant, your atheist, it doesn't' matter.  You are treated the same way, okay.  So what that means is that, yes, politically there have been some issues between, sometimes the Muslims and the Christians, but if you look at the, for the population and the people themselves, there's no difference because what people actually--and that's what I strongly believe, what people realize is that we all come from the same source and we all end up at the same.  So, yes, we can have different path, but we're all together.
Speaker 2: I saw a movie about Ousmane Sembene [Senegalese film director, producer and writer]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Sembene.
Speaker 2: --called 'Guelwaar' with that theme.  That was the theme of the movie.
Speaker 1: Yes, and you see that, really see that in Africa, I mean in Senegal.
Speaker 2: Right, but what I was asking, was there a specific denomination, with SDA, I mean did most of your relatives that accomplished these lofty goals, lawyers, professors and, you know, did they come in through the SDA?  That's what I'm asking.
Speaker 1: No, as I mentioned, some of my--
Speaker 2: So they're different ways.
Speaker 1: --Yes, my families, we have Christians and we have Muslims.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We also have Catholics, and so it's a mixture, which is also good because we also grew up by learning beliefs of others and respecting them.  One example, when I was at the, in college, I used to work with, my best friend at that time, he was doing math, physics at that time.  And so we got the Muslim and the Christian fast, right.  So when he was fasting, I was fasting with him, and we were studying together.  But right after, you got the Christian one, and he was fasting with me, and we--so, and (laughter), that's the type of stories that happen in countries where you have a mixture and people actually co-exist without any problem.
Story_ID: 20750
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, we were talking about family history, and what did your father [Jupiter Gueye] say about growing up and how did--what did he do for a living?  And how did he get there?
Speaker 2: So he was, as I mentioned, he was a principal of a high school, and he did actually his studies in France.  So he went to France to complete his education and came back and actually--not only him, but also his siblings, did the same.  So my uncles and aunts, most of them went to France to finish their education, besides the one that I mentioned, who did her Ph.D. in Senegal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there are some that stayed, but a lot of them went overseas to complete, especially the eldest one.  So he became a, he was a teacher, a Spanish teacher, and ended up being a principal of a high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a path or a link as to how, I mean how your father ended up--
Speaker 2: Yeah, to becoming a Spanish teacher?
Speaker 1: --yeah, involved in education and was his father involved in education too?
Speaker 2: His father which, who was my grandfather, was the lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so he's a lawyer.  Now, what about his father?  Was his father a lawyer too?
Speaker 2: My great grandfather?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, okay, you have no--the people in your family don't really talk about how people made the transition from--
Speaker 2: I would say--let me rephrase it a little bit.  It's, it's not that we don't talk about it.  It's, it might be just a personal thing to some degree which is I didn't sit down to, and record all of this information as far as, and really trying to be sure to understand where, how this came about and where this came about.  You may have a different story if you interview one of my brothers or some of my cousins.  They may tell you, oh, yeah, this is what happened.  That hasn't been something that I've been interested in learning.  They were here.  I enjoyed the company, and my, I guess, goal, I would say, it was to make everybody happy.  And, yeah.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, okay, so your father, so he started school Senegal, and then he went to France--
Speaker 2: Right, went to France to do his--
Speaker 1: And what school did he go to in France?
Speaker 2: It was in a, I guess Marseille, but I'm not sure it was in Marseille, in the South of France, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.  I do remember--I don't remember the specific school, but I do remember he went to France.  I can't remember which one it is.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, is there--you said your mother [Elisabeth Soumah] is a principal too, of a school?
Speaker 2: That's correct, elementary school.
Speaker 1: In Guinea.
Story_ID: 20751
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Elisabeth Soumah and Jupiter Gueye] met?
Speaker 2: I think it was at a party, not a hundred percent sure.  But I know that my dad was a great dancer, and that's how I think he managed to get in touch with her, and eventually, they got married.
Speaker 1: Now, did they meet in France or did they meet in--
Speaker 2: In Senegal.
Speaker 1: In Senegal, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It was in Senegal.  So Senegal, because of the unique location and history of this country, you know, it's in the triangle location, we had a lot of, we were, let's say better developed as far as infrastructure compared to some of the other countries.  So it's been for a long time and is still actually, has been an attraction for many Africans to be able to go to Dakar [capital city of Senegal] or to go to the University of Dakar to get their education.  So a lot of people came over there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20752
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their talents, their looks even, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: That's a funny question.  Let's put it that way because I'm a twin, as I mentioned.  And if you look at me, you can see my mom [Elisabeth Soumah], you can see my dad [Jupiter Gueye].  You look at my brother [Rene Gueye], you can see none of them.  So we used to joke in telling him that we just got him from the, from outside (laughter).  But so actually, I've got both.  My, I'm much lighter than--I mean (unclear), I'm lighter than my twin brother.  He's darker, so he got my dad's color.  I got my mom's color.  But as far as the facial, I got both.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how many brothers and sisters do you have and where you rank in the order?
Speaker 2: Okay, so my twin brother and myself were the first from them.  And they divorced, and my dad got remarried, and he had a daughter.  Her name is Mary-Rose.  After that, they had a son, Andres-Louis, and after two other girls.  So Anna and Agnes.  My mom never remarried.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 20753
Speaker 1: So when you grew up, in the household, you grew up in, you grew up in your father's household pretty much?
Speaker 2: Nope.  I grew up with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother, okay.
Speaker 2: We were raised, yeah, since we were, I think about one year old.  We grew up with my--so they actually separated very early after--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you and your twin brother [Rene Gueye] grew up with your grandmother?
Speaker 2: We were basically raised by my grandmother.  That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On my dad's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you grew up in Dakar [Senegal]--
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: --the same town with your father [Jupiter Gueye]?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you see him often or--
Speaker 2: Yes, almost, well, I'll say almost every week.  It's not completely true because obviously, you got other things and he was also having a family and so forth, but, yeah, I was seeing him often.  My mom [Elisabeth Soumah] was also living in Dakar, but further in the suburb.  We were seeing him [her] less often, and so I was seeing more of my dad and my dad sometimes was coming to my grandmother's house more often than my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were basically raised by your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you give us her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Mary, Mary, so with a "y" Georgina, G-E-O-R-G-I-N-A, Morgan was her maiden name and Gueye, her last name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she's part of the, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was she born in Dakar?
Speaker 2: She is also from Guinea.
Speaker 1: From Guinea, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes, but obviously, she spent all of her life in Dakar because of her husband.
Story_ID: 20754
Speaker 1: Okay, so, I know we know that, a lot of that was the political lines of states in Africa cut across ethnic, you know, the original lines--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --ethnic lines.  Is this case with your grandmother [Mary Georgina Morgan Gueye] and your mother [Elisabeth Soumah] in terms of their being in Guinea, being born in Guinea and then--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, they just, they just came and stay over there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there a lot of traffic between Guinea and Senegal?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  There is a lot of traffic between Senegal and a lot of other countries.  Yeah, you almost see virtually every, almost every-representative from every country in Senegal.  And, again, this is mainly because Senegal has been for a long time a far off (unclear) as far as development.  I'm talking about sub-Saharan Africa, obviously.  So a lot of people wants to come into culture with Senegal and the (unclear) movement.  So everybody was really attracted to--as far as education, we were the reference, and we still are to some degree, but not as much anymore, which is a good, (unclear) the ratings to go up.  And so everybody wants, wanted to come to Senegal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20755
Speaker 1: There are two things that come into mind.  One was Easter and, so because we were twins we were kind of special in my family, my brother [Rene Gueye] and I.  So we used to have the, more gifts than all of the other cousins or the biggest ones.
Speaker 2: Now, is this part of an African tradition of being twins or it's just something in your family or--
Speaker 1: Twins are special in Africa, and they're always treated with special--so I remember having this big ole fish, made out of chocolate.  And we waited when grandma went to sleep, and we just ate that whole thing.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, of course, we got a big beating at the end (laughter).  So that's one of the thing that I remember.  Also, we were, when we were in elementary school, we had something, I don't know how we managed, but if we didn't like a teacher, for example, we were able to put the whole school with us against the teacher.  So not only the classroom and the teacher would, of course, start screaming left and right until she get sick, and we switch.  So and this, we always did that as a--, growing up.  So those are the two memories that I--and I don't know which one came first.  But--.
Story_ID: 20756
Speaker 1: Well, can you describe the neighborhood you grew up in with your [paternal] grandmother [Mary Georgina Morgan Gueye]?
Speaker 2: Yes, so we grew up in Dakar [Senegal] in an area called, not far from one of the main archeries called Lemongueye (ph.).  And there was a big market, Sandaga, where we go to do grocery shopping, but again, you're talking about Africa.  So it's open market, right.  We walk to school.  It was about a thirty minutes' walk to get to school.  When we were younger, of course, we had one of our uncle picking us up.  But that is something that because it was a safe environment, and we all know each other as far as neighbors and friends.  Somebody come, ring at your door, you go out and hold hands and you just walk all the way to school.  And I don't see that anymore as much.  But that's one of the thing that we used to do.  Of course, like any other kids, playing soccer or football, as we call it, is something that we used to do a lot, the cousins and friends from the neighborhood, okay.  On Saturday--on Sunday, having a game on the street, spending a lot of time with, how you call it?  Well, we spend night to other family members or they spend the night at our place.  One thing that, one tradition that we used to have--actually, there were two of them.  One was, once a month, we, one of my uncle, the one who was a doctor, had a hut on a beach about an hour or two hours away from the city.  So we used to all go over there for, on Sundays.  And we go in the morning and come back in the afternoon.  So it was something that was kind of for us in tradition.  It was something that I really cherished.  And I was seeing that was also awesome, was the Sundays.  Every Sunday my grandma established, I would say, a rule, where all of her sons and daughters would come to her house to, for lunch and dinner.  So these were great because we all see each other for sure once a week.  There was a memorable match against, between the old and the young, whether it was football or cards, card games.  But that was great because, yeah, we all see each other growing up.  And, yeah, I miss those actually.  And I remember when I went--I don't go back often.  If you look at the price of a ticket now-a-days, it's between 1,500 to 2,000 [dollars] a piece.  So it's not easy to go from the U.S. over there.  But because of my involvement now with Africa and some other work that I'm trying to do there, I'm able to go almost once a year, meaningful work.  But I remember a few years ago I went there and since I'm one of the few that are overseas, so it's an event when I come back.  And me being still with the memory of what happened in the past.  You know how when you go, you always remember the good stuff and so forth.  So I was able to reach out to virtually, not only all of my cousin, but even those that didn't have the, didn't used to come, and they were all at home that day.  It was when I was in France actually.  There was a great memorial so, as well.
Story_ID: 20757
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we always ask this question.  You've dealt with it on some level, but what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, sights, Goree Island [near Dakar, Senegal], we used to go over there quite a lot.
Speaker 1: Explain to those who don't know what Goree Island is.
Speaker 2: So Goree is one of those islands where slaves used to be brought into and after shipped to the U.S.  So it's a historical place.  But it's also a place where a lot of Senegal natives live and also a place where a lot of young and adults go during their week, especially during the weekend because it's an island.  That means the water and the--so it's a great place to go over there, over the weekend.  And we did have, also a couple of my family members had houses over there.  So we were able to go and enjoy our self a lot.  So Goree is also where I met a lot of friends, very good friends, that I grew up with who were living actually over there.  So Goree is, one of the thing that we used to do, and I think it's forbidden now, but there's a ferry that goes from the mainland [Dakar] to the island and takes about twenty minutes or so.  And there is a big boat, a large boat that sank, that sunk a while back, so there's a buoy and the ferry goes around.  It cannot cut through because of the mud.  But one thing that we used to do is we just all go on the ferry and when the ferry leave the island and go around that buoy, we jump, and we swim.  And that's about, it's, I would say about, almost ten times the length of--oh, more than that really, yeah, about ten times the length of Olympic swimming pool, okay.  So it's very scary because you don't know what's underneath, but--and it's sometimes pretty windy and you got the wave, but it's--we all loved to do that as we got a bunch of kids just jumping and swimming back.  And you have to do that once just to show that you know how to swim and all that.  So that's some of the memory that was at Goree.
Story_ID: 20758
Speaker 1: The smell, Senegal is on the coast, so some of the dishes, most of the dishes have fish in it and a lot of vegetables also and rice, basically rice and fish is one of our main dish.  It's called Ceebu Jen, "Ceebu" for rice and "Jen" for the fish [Thieboudienne, Ceebu Jen], and which is a fish with a lot of vegetables made up within and cooked in a tomato sauce basically.  So that smell, you smell it virtually everywhere 'cause that's, it looks like people are eating that things every single day, lunch and evening; same with the tea.  The same tea that is being done in Mauritania.  So it's a teapot and we call it "phono" [ph.], which is basically a--so we don't use stove.  We use wood, charcoal, so you have a real teapot and you put the tea into it.  It's actually called gunpowder.  It come from China.  It's green, green tea, and so like the English have their four o'clock tea, Senegalese have to have their tea.  And that tea is served in three--it's like a ceremony, so there are three different take.  So for the first one, just basically have the water into it and when you drink it, it's very bitter.  And it's very, very strong actually.  And the next time, you start putting sugar so it's getting sweeter and sweeter.  But because of, so you keep cooking, the strength of the tea is also stronger and stronger.  So there's a balance to starts to be established.  And towards the end, you put some mint.  So the taste change, okay.  And what I found very, so what's interesting with that tea is that--there are two things.  One is that everybody has to have their tea.  So morning, after lunch, sometimes people skip school or don't come back to work because they have to have their tea.  If they don't have it, they don't come back.  I mean I never understood that, but (laughter).  The other thing is, I don't know how to say that in English, but staying up all night just drinking tea.  And one thing that I found fascinating is people who are shy or don't talk, that tea will open your mouth.  And so we had some very amazing stories or discussions with people just because drinking some tea.  So, and that's something that also you will smell everywhere.  And that, of course, I'm missing.  And growing up I also was involved in sports.  So I did, of course, soccer and I mean football and others, but I also was in martial art.  And so I did Judo and also Viet Vo Dao which is a Vietnamese martial art.  And so when you're--
Speaker 2: What's it called?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Viet Vo Dao, it's Vovinam, for Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Can you spell it?
Speaker 1: Yes, so Judo, you know, and Vovinam, V-O-V-I-N-A-M, Viet, like the beginning of Vietnam, Vo Dao.  So I started that over there and continue in France.
Speaker 2: Now, is there a connection between--I know that the Vietnam was at one time colonized by France too--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and is there a Senegalese-Vietnamese connection that's pretty natural or what?
Speaker 1: No, not like this.  The only, well, if you want a connection as far as Vietnam and that particular martial art [Viet Vo Dao, Vovinam], there is no, nothing like what the French did as far as colonization.  Right now, the Chinese are more present in Senegal than others, but there hasn't been anything particular with Vietnam besides that martial art that I'm just mentioning.
Speaker 2: Okay, I just wondered if there was any, you know, the English and Commonwealth--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --a lot of the countries share different things that were in the Commonwealth, and I was just wondering if it was the same way in Francophone, you know, in the Francophone world?
Speaker 1: Yeah, nope.  The only reason that that particular martial art came in Senegal is because back in Vietnam, the grand master of that art basically sent some of his students, one in Europe, one in Africa, one in Russia and so forth and one in, some in the United States and Canada.  And the one in Africa was basically Ivory Coast, and one of his students was from Senegal.  So when he came back, he opened a school, and that's how the thing started.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, so because I was involved in high-level sports and competition, so you also have the smell of sweat and all of these, and all of the (unclear), so this is something also that has been part of my life, growing up.
Story_ID: 20759
Speaker 1: Were you a good--were you good at martial arts or soccer [football]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Soccer, yes, I wanted to become--, and one of my uncle--, actually that's one of the story, I wanted to become a professional soccer player, and that becoming a physicists, and so there's always a story.  Now, see if you would have become a soccer player, you would have had billions now (laughter).  And so I did, I was part of some team like any others, but I didn't pursue that.  Martial art, I went pretty far.  So in Judo I went all the way to having a brown belt, and before passing my black belt, actually I switch into Vovinam Viet Vo Dao where I studied in Dakar [Senegal].  And now I'm a third degree black belt in that.  So when I went to France, I actually was trained by the son of the grand master at that time.  And I became the European champion in fighting.  So, yeah, I went high.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And something that is still part of my, part of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  Do you teach it now?
Speaker 2: Here in the U.S., yes.  When I came--yes and no.  When I came in the U.S. back in 1995, I actually opened a school here at the [Thomas] Jefferson [National] Lab [Jlab, Virginia]--it was not a school, per se, it was more an activity for Jefferson lab users.  And Jefferson Lab is a Department of Energy [DOE] facility that is studying the nuclear structure with an electron beam.  So there was a lot of students at that time, and why?  Because there was a lot of French students who were doing their Ph.D., okay, plus some, many foreigners.  There were a couple, fewer Americans.  When they were done, they went back and the activity started to go down.  So I more or less stopped teaching over there.  I taught after that at, here at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] actually in the student center, but primarily for the little kids.  And we do have here on campus a child development center.  So I reach out to them, and I was going over there almost every week doing some activities, physics and martial art.  And since then I also stopped.  So it's, there's no, not a club per se, and the reason I'm not opening one right now is because I want to be sure I can commit to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20760
Speaker 1: Now, I had a question about Goree [Island, near Dakar, Senegal], and you were born in 1966 and this is the year of the first Pan African Festival of the Arts in Dakar and the big pageant was held on the island of Goree.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And it was a pageant in commemoration of the many souls that were lost during the slave trade.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So African American often go to Senegal.  They go to the castle or the slave castle on the Island of Goree.  And they stand in the Door of No Return and all that [The House of Slaves and its Door of No Return is a museum and memorial to the Atlantic slave trade on Goree Island, 3 kilometers off the coast of the city of Dakar, Senegal].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Are you, I mean how, were you aware of that growing up and--the festival first of all and the significance of the--I mean what were the local stories about the significance of that 'cause we never hear what--
Speaker 2: Yes.  So one thing that is interesting in Senegal is like the U.S. love Africa, we also love the U.S.  So when this festival was starting to be put together, I mean virtually every, almost every kid that I know of knew about it, and they were--we were all excited about it.  And I have flash when I'm talking right now, flashback of some people dancing and some, some people walking in the street.  I can visualize that in my mind right now.  Around the same time, there was also, there was a famous theater, Diamsobadoo (ph.), where also some activities were held in conjunction to that festival.  So it's something that was a big deal.  I do remember that, and we talked about it for a while.  The only thing that is, that I feel is a little bit sad right now is that--but I guess it's evolution.  What I remember from Goree is not exactly what it is now, right.  So a bit more constructions, more things right there.  So you lose a little bit some of the memories.  I mean going from the top to the bottom of the island because there's a bit of a mountain, I would say, there was a path that we used to take and slide (unclear).  Now, that path is occupied by other things.  And that means more humans, less natural resources.  Let's put it that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the festival was something that was, was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 20761
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about school.  Where did you start school?  Did you go to preschool or anything or did you just start?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to preschool so it was, used to be called Ecole de Plateau.  So actually, it was a school that was attached to our church.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was the name of church?
Speaker 2: Eglise Protestant.  So "Eglise" is the word for church in French.  So it's E-G-L-I-S-E.
Speaker 1: E-G-
Speaker 2: L-I-S-E.
Speaker 1: L-I-S-E, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Protestant, Protestant.  And so the school was called Ecole Protestant.  So the "Protestant" label was there, and so it was the primary school for that church.  And, of course, on, I would say a location in the city that we call the Plateau.
Speaker 1: In the Plateau, okay.
Speaker 2: So it's called Ecole Protestant de Plateau.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and so was that the same--so where you started preschool is where you continued with elementary school too?
Speaker 2: So that was preschool and the, part of the elementary school.  The rest was done in another place.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm gonna ask this question.  I ask this of everybody.  Was it, now, when you went to school, was it common for everybody to go to school in Dakar [Senegal], all students?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or was there mandatory public education?
Speaker 2: So the good thing in Senegal is that, which is a big difference with the U.S., is that school is free.  What I mean by that, I can get a Ph.D. for ten dollars, okay.  Now, I think they're starting to change the system, but, yeah, because I just find that out here about a few weeks ago that things will change soon.  But so, if you want to go to public school, of course, everything is provided as much as possible because you see we also are a developing country.  You're gonna hear a story about, even in the villages, I mean the teacher has just cardboard and doing school.  You get tons of kids sitting in front and they're teaching, and you have private schools.  And so those who can afford can go over there.  So I went to private school until my--until the high school.  The middle school and high school was in a public school, but the elementary and the primary school was in a private school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved school.  As somebody that really enjoyed being there 'cause, of course, you play a lot with your friends and again, my twin [Rene Gueye] and I, we were bad kids.  We were really bad kids.  But by "bad" means, not doing drugs and so forth, but really into stuff.  So you--I remember a few years ago, I went back and people are still remembering us.  That's how bad we were (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Now, when you say "bad", what--
Speaker 2: Well, for example, I mentioned earlier that we didn't like our teacher, okay.  We put the whole school together.  One thing that we were good at also is we don't like kids to sit by themselves because a lot of people sometimes, I mean and that happens even when you're grown up, right.  You have somebody that is different or look different, and they're pushed aside.  It's not something that we, we--well, I'll stay that we like.  Let's put it that way.  So we be--we always be sure that every kids was playing.  So we managed, I don't know how we did that, but to get virtually the whole school to play together.  And if somebody was not, was put aside, we bring him or her into that--but we went to staff, so that means--
Speaker 1: Well, that doesn't sound bad, you know, bringing the kids into--
Speaker 2: But bad means that now you have all of the teachers trying to figure out how to handle this crowd that is running and breaking stuff or we'd take some--I mean there was a mango tree in elementary.  We'd take the mango and just throw it at each other, and when it was raining, I remember my, one thing, one game that we did one day, there was, it rained, so there was water.  And so we run and just slide, and my twin brother slide and went on a circle, and the next thing he knows there was a window, and he put his hand.  But, of course, his hand went through, cut himself.  But that was fun too (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you have school uniforms?
Speaker 2: No, no uniforms, no.
Speaker 1: No uniforms, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And, no, there was also a big gigantic cage where we could all climb, you know, for physical activities.  But this carried on from the primary to the elementary school.  We were always--actually, when we went from primary to elementary, my grandma [Mary Georgina Morgan Gueye] went to the principal and said, those kids need to be in a different classroom.  He said, okay, but we waited when recess was coming, back into it again, so playing or how you call it, marbles or whatever, but bring all the kids again (laughter).  So I have great, great memory of, of my schools, I mean all of them actually.  It was a very, very enjoyable.
Story_ID: 20762
Speaker 1: A lot of young boys I know wish they had a best friend that was the same age living with 'em, you know.  So you had like your twin brother [Rene Gueye], so you--
Speaker 2: I had my twin brother, yes.
Speaker 1: --can go, you all could join forces (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That's right, and we did join forces.  Yeah, one story that happened when we started to date and so forth is that we have the same voice.  We don't look alike.  I mean he's a little bit taller, darker, but when people were calling, we switched phone all the time (laughter) and people could not make the difference.  So that was fun.  But the bad part, one of the things to mention, for example, my grandma [Mary Georgina Morgan Gueye] goes to the market.  We climb to the roof, and it's dangerous obviously, and those are slanted roof and not flat-top.  We used to do some very, very--boy stuff, let's put it that way, crazy stuff.
Story_ID: 20763
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, when did you go to grammar school, I mean elementary school?  So you started off at--
Speaker 2: So I'm starting off at Ecole (unclear) Protestant de Plateau [Dakar, Senegal] and yeah, we went after to a [pause]--because I'm, it's called Dial Diop now.  They changed the name, and I'm trying to remember the original name 'cause I just got an email from my brother [Rene Gueye] who is actually trying to connect to all of the people that went to the primary school to put something together with pictures and all that.  He just sent it about a couple of hours ago, and now, I have the new name in my head, and I cannot remember the original name.  But it's called, now we call Dial Diop.  Maybe I'll remember before the end of the interview.
Speaker 1: How do you spell it now, I mean the new name?
Speaker 2: Dial, D-I-A-L and Diop, D-I-O-P which is a common last name.
Speaker 1: Yes, right, right.  Now, that is a common name.  I mean there're so many famous Diops, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Birago Diop [Senagalese poet and story-teller], David Diop [poet], you know,  Arliun (ph.) Diop, you know.
Speaker 2: Arliun Diop, yep.
Speaker 1: And Cheikh Anta Diop [historian, anthropologist, physicist and politician].
Speaker 2: Cheikh Anta Diop, there you go.
Speaker 1: All those Diops over there.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So it is a really common name.
Speaker 2: It's a, oh, yeah, Gueye, Diop, Sau [ph.], I mean there's a lot of, like Williams and all that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did you have a favorite teacher in school?  Is there a teacher that really said, well, these two bad guys, but I'm gonna help 'em.
Speaker 2: Well, we were bad, but we were not that bad--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the sense that they did not want to talk to us.  I would say that not really also.  And, again, that's just me, but every teacher brought something special.  So the elementary teachers, one memory that I have is one time we were doing countries, so China, North Pole, blah, blah, blah.  And she came with a, when we were doing China, she came dressed--she was a white teacher, she came dressed with a Chinese outfit, and we ate rice and milk with the chopstick.  And since then I love rice and milk.  And my daughter also now start to, I mean she got hooked on it.  When we did the North Pole, it was the Eskimos.  We ate raw meat.  So she really put us into the, that environment.  Learning about trees, we went outside.  There was, we did a field trip that way, so there was a baobab, which is one of the largest trees in Africa.  And there's another picture of my head.  There was about thirty kids.  We all hold hands.  We could not do, couldn't go around that tree.
Speaker 1: Yeah, baobab is about--
Speaker 2: It's huge.
Speaker 1: --as big as a house.
Speaker 2: People actually used that for houses back in the day.  So that's when I realized how big that thing is.  I mean thirty little kids holding hands, we could not go around it.  I said, wow.  So this is what I remember from her.  In primary school, it was all about starting to get all your foundations before going into middle school and all that.  And in each class, every teacher was also very special.
Story_ID: 20764
Speaker 1: One of the memories [of school in Dakar, Senegal] was doing math.  So one of the teachers had a very unique way of teaching us how to solve particular problems, either using, using what was around the classroom or some of the things that we used to use back home [Senegal], whether it's, again, I mentioned this tool where we cook, right.  It can be this piece of element.  It can be mangoes.  It can be anything she was able to explain things in a way that, oh, that makes sense.  And after, in high school, it was the same thing, learning first of all hydrogen and oxygen, putting them into water, you got the big boom.  So we have a teacher that, of course, did experiments.  And it's exciting, but after--what's next, right?  So one of the teachers in biology was great in explaining, of course, all of the, dissecting all of the frogs and all that.  But it was really the way he was approaching things was unique.  He will make sure that every--although we were, I don't know, twenty kids in a classroom, that every kids use his own way of or his own ability to extract the right information, okay.  So he will go one-by-one.  At some point, I even wanted to become a biologist just because of that.  One of my math teachers in high school also was very good, and she put herself in a way where she was the teacher, but she was more at the student level.  And now that means you break some barriers as far as always--'cause when you have a teacher and you, it's always, you're always scared to ask a question because the person is different.  But when the person puts him or herself at your level, some of the barriers breaks down.  And so, it's, those are stories, but I can pick up pretty much every single teacher and (unclear) that will sparkle my interest in going forward or learning more about a topic, even in college.  And there were, (laughter) a guy who actually did his--he was a former student of [Louis] Dubois, one of the famous [French] physicists, and there was always a question that nobody could answer.  He said for the, for the name of the university.  So there was always a problem.  You can take a whole week and you cannot solve it.  So those are stories on some teachers, but I mean they're all flashing right now in my head, and everybody, indeed, did something (unclear) whether it was in science, non-science topic.  I'd never had a passing grade in high school on philosophy.
Speaker 2: Really.
Speaker 1: Philosophy, no.
Speaker 2: You didn't like philosophy?
Speaker 1: No, I loved philosophy.  That was one of the best subjects, but I could not (laughter) get a passing grade.  The teacher was one of the best teacher I ever had too; could not have it, which is also another way that, now that I'm a teacher, nobody can tell me--I'm not accepting a student getting a failing grade because there's no reason you're failing that class.  If I cannot explain to you, there's somebody else that can explain to you.  And if a teacher is making the class not exciting, you need to go and find beyond the teacher, somebody that will make that topic exciting because when it's exciting, you want to learn about it.  When it's not exciting, usually you slow down or whatever and after your grade goes down.  That's the idea.  So, and that's the story that I always mention, I mean always, one of the stories, which is never had a passing grade, but I loved the topic.  But don't do like me, of course, but just to mention that the interesting topic should not exclusively rely on the person if--another story that I can mention is Hampton [Virginia].  I can show you Hampton as one of the best cities in the U.S. or one of the worst.  It depend on who is behind the camera.  So never rely on the information.  Go and find yourself.  I mean there are some good information, but go beyond.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 20765
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on your school days, is there a time that you think that you first became interested in science or was it just part of the regular flow?
Speaker 2: That's, I would say, I guess it's still, probably was since I was a kid and the fact also I have people involved in the medical field 'cause biology is always the hook for everybody.  Everybody wants to be a doctor (laughter).  But my thing was always playing with stuff.  I used to be in the kitchen all the time with my grandma [Mary Georgina Morgan Gueye].  And that was good actually because when I went to France, I knew how to cook (laughter).  But, so yeah, you mix ingredients and you got a different taste.  Why?  I remember my brother [Rene Gueye] and I at night, we were outside in the, I want to say, it's not a patio, but the court, I guess we had (unclear) space and lay down and look at the sky.  We see all the stars and try to figure out what is behind the thing and just trying to figure out things.  Of course, when you're a kid, you break stuff, you get a spanking.  I remember sometimes you walk and just hit something, the radio fall and breaks down.  And especially, grandma's radio where she listened to the news and everything, so she asked, one day she asked me to go and turn it on, and the whole thing breaks down.  And, of course, I get blamed for that when it was my brother actually who broke it, but just put it, you know, away, right?  So there's a lot of things actually that we did this way.  But at some point, the thing is opened, and you look at it and say, okay, so why is that then.  So I've always been curious about things.
Speaker 1: Were you able to fix things?
Speaker 2: I was able to fix some, not always, but, yeah, I was able to fix things.  One, a game that we used to play also is taking a tire, and I think some may do that in the U.S., and a stick, and you put the stick behind the tire, and you make it to roll, right.  And you run with it, and by pushing the stick a certain way, you can control the tire to go one way or the other.  So we put a path and a team, so you got some teams against others and you basically race.  And who won will win the first and so forth.  So, but this is also something when, now that I'm thinking back about it, with all of those tools and experience and growing up in a place where there's not a lot of, there's not a lot of technology per se compared to the U.S.  What matters is, I mentioned that to you earlier, is a great imagination and how you make things to work with virtually nothing.  I mean it's pretty amazing.  You have people in developing countries saving lives, right, in hospitals, and some of them have virtually no tools.  So that's pretty impressive.  So if they, if those people have tools, what can they do?
Speaker 1: Okay.  So speaking of technology, you said your grandmother had a radio.  Did you all have television growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, we used to have, back in the day, was you get up and turn the knob or take the pliers because the knob is off and when it past and you past the channel, okay, you redo it again.  Some time we have to climb on the roof to fix the antenna so that you get good reception, but yeah (laughter).  We used to have that, yeah.
Speaker 1: So the atmosphere you were growing up in, would you say that you were encouraged to be inquisitive and to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean our, our environment was such that if you're good somewhere, that's great.  If you're not good, how can we help you to fill that gap.  So we were always nurtured into learning more and more about stuff.  One of my aunt, who is also my godmother, she's the one who got her Ph.D. in pharmacy, the first one, there were two things that she loved to do.  One was cooking and by cooking and pharmacy, of course, but the cooking aspects of it is she could virtually do any dish, of course, you just open a cookbook and--, but she would always put some arts into it.  So it was always very nice dish when it comes in front of you.  It looked so nice, you don't wanna touch it.  And but this was also something that if you're a kid and you think about it, it's not--well, it allows you to, when you help to do those dishes and go in the kitchen and put it together, well, you start to do art.  So brain actually starts to register something, how to decorate or even how to draw which is a very useful tool, especially when you're in science.  If you know how to draw a problem, put it into a framework, you got it.  So I believe that some of these experiences, of course, build up some particular tools or expertise that now I can use in my, my day-to-day job or in my life.
Story_ID: 20766
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have physics in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, so--
Speaker 1: Well, what was the name of your high school?  I didn't ask that.
Speaker 2: Lamine Gueye.  Lamine, one of my middle name, and Gueye.  But the older name was Lycee Van Vollenovhen.  So it was Dutch, named after a Dutch guy, Van Vollenovhen, and we used to call it, Lycee Van Vo.
Speaker 1: You have to spell it.
Speaker 2: So "lycee" is high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: Oh, Van, V-A-N, second name is V-O, and Vollenovhen was V-O-L-L-E-N-O-V-H-E-N, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Van Vollenovhen.  Yes, so we are based on the European system, especially the French system which means that, we don't have a choice, right, so we have history, geography.  You have to choose two languages, a third one if you want to, so I choose English and Spanish.  And math, physics, biology, chemistry.  So you're required to take them, and until, I think they're also starting to maybe change the system, but it was, the education that you had was also, you know it or you don't know.  In other words, they're not gonna let you go to the next level if you don't ace your exam.
Speaker 1: So the grading system is not A, B, C, D, E, but it's--
Speaker 2: No, but they're starting to change that now with their moving--
Speaker 1: But it's more, you either pass or fail, you know it or you don't.
Speaker 2: It was the pass, the French system, yes, and which gave a lot of very solid foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you have--what year of high school did--how many years is high school, first of all?
Speaker 2: It's five years, well, that's the old system (laughter).  So the middle school, it's [pause], so that's three years in middle school.  And after, and three years in high school.  So six years, and I think that maybe this is the full high school if you compare with the U.S., but, yeah.
Speaker 1: U.S. high school is like four years, but that's what they traditionally call it, but there can be an overlap between the middle school and high school.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, it's a three, three, basically.
Speaker 1: So do you take physics like towards the end of the high school or in the beginning?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.  So the good thing with that old system is, so in middle school, you basically have all of the classes, right.  And depending on how you perform, if you're very bad in math and physics and science, but you seem to be very good in language, in history and so forth, they start to redirect you towards becoming a lawyer.  So you have a track where you do math, forget about physics and chemistry so the science, but you do some, still some math.  But now the emphasis is on classes that will give you the foundation to going to becoming a lawyer or literal art.  If you are still good in math and economy and so forth but science is still not something for you, now you have a chance to become an economist, right, or business.  And in science, it depends, if you're very good at math or if you're not, if you're very, very good at math, there was a track that was, I would say the--well, we used to call it the cream of the crop where they do very detailed, advanced courses in math, physics and chemistry, but not so much about biology.  So those people are the ones that goes into, for example, the French system called the (unclear), I don't know if you've heard about that.  This is a special school.  It's almost like MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Harvard [University, Cambridge], but it's a different system.  So only if you do that, that you can get there usually because those are very, very hard ones.  Now, if you're good in bio, now, you get a track to become a medical doctor or go into the biology and now, you do basically, all of the science, so math and physics as well, but not as in depth as the other ones.  In addition to--that was the one actually had overlap almost with everybody else.  Okay, so you got more of a large panel of knowledge on that track.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 20767
Speaker 1: So did you--you ended up in the physics track, I guess, and the math track.
Speaker 2: No, I ended up in the one that was overlapping with everybody else and which is also something that has driven my education is, I'm somebody that always felt like everything is connected, okay, and I mention that to you.  So I always wanted to learn as much as possible, and which is a problem, right, because the more you go further, the narrower your choices are.  So I was always trying to figure out, okay, what can I do that still gives me the opportunity to still do all the things 'cause I love to read and learn all the things.  So that path was great because I was able to do science, non-science and what not, and when I went to college, there was either with the degree that I had in high school, it was either going into physics and chemistry or math, physics or natural sciences, all to go into the medical school.  If I go to medical school, I'm not gonna do physics and chemistry and all that as I wanted to.  If I go to natural sciences, it will be the same.  It's more biology and so forth.  If I go to math, physics, I drop the chemistry.  So I choose physics and chemistry, and I realized that actually, yeah, I'm going to lose the bio [biology] aspect, but because I have family members in pharmacy and the medical field, I can still talk to them.  So that's how I did my, all the way to my master's [degree].
Story_ID: 20768
Speaker 1: Okay, now, let me go back to high school for a minute though.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The high school experience in Senegal, is it--how does it compare to the high school experience here?  I think people--I mean socially, do you have like a prom and all that, and do you have sports teams and--
Speaker 2: No, so that is actually something that was a very interesting, how do I say that, experience, when I came in the U.S.  From the, all the way down to the elementary school, you guys have graduation, every year.  And I could not understand why, why you have to have a graduation, and I realized that actually in the U.S., that's how I see it--, it's more of giving a child a diploma to excite that child to continue.  Back home, at least when I grew up, you start, you don't stop.  I mentioned a few things.  One is, I mentioned that you go in a village in Africa, you're gonna see tens or hundreds of kids--there was even some documentary, right, about that, where kids actually sit on the floor in the classroom.  The thirst for learning is there and that may be because of how they are raised.  They want to learn.  They want to understand things, and they're gonna be quiet when the teacher talks.  The only reason they're not gonna go forward is if there is a funding issue or for a female, they have to get married sometimes at a young age or some other thing that you cannot control.  Here you have to push people.  Over there, you don't have to push them.  So we don't have this graduation, prom and all that.  The only thing that we have is a big exam at the end of high school, actually, at the end of middle school and at the end of high school.  And that big exam, if you pass it, you go to high school.  If you pass it, you go to college.  You don't pass it, you stay.  That means you don't have the foundation to move forward.  Again, the system is being changed, so I don't know now what's happening, and actually, I need to be involved because I'm trying to do some things with Africa, with Senegal.  But it looks like things may change in the near future.  But that's the only, that's the only change that we have.  And, of course, when you finish high school, now, there's a big party, but that's more of a family thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20769
Speaker 1: All right, so we were talking about the difference in high school education [between the U.S. and Senegal] and, so you graduated from--now, there's a high school graduation.  And then you said your family celebrated.  So this is, what year is this, about '85 [1985] or--
Speaker 2: It was '85 [1985], that's correct.
Speaker 1: And you were eighteen, eighteen years old?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was eighteen years old.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So do they have a ceremony with the mortar boards and all that?
Speaker 2: No, it was more of my brother [Rene Gueye] and I we went to, of course, we went to a club with our cousins and we had dinner.  And more of, maybe like a birthday party, if you will.  That's all.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, had you like--did you know much about at that point, like, I guess the history of physics and what was going on in physics by the time you graduated?
Speaker 2: Nope, not at all.  I was just--
Speaker 1: So you were more of a general as you were saying--
Speaker 2: I was more of a general person trying to learn as much, and after high school, it was college where I could learn more stuff, then let's go.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a hero in high school or someone that you, you know, looked up to that you wanted to be like?
Speaker 2: That's a tough question.  I can't remember anybody else either.  It really was about--okay, no, I will take that back.  I would say one of the persons that--two people motivate in science was my godmother.  So my aunt who did the Ph.D. in pharmacy, and because of the way she approached things, she was always very open to all of possible explanation, learning a lot about science and talking a lot about different topics whether it was quantum mechanics or black holes and all that, although that was not her field.  So that did inspire me in regards to the learning process.  And my uncle who was a doctor, okay, and surgeon, so he--I actually went back to him when I had to make a decision as far as my going further for my Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he helped counsel you.
Speaker 2: He helped counsel me, yeah, but I'm gonna mention that, oh, I can actually mention right now is that I was very, how do I say that--the further, as I mentioned, the further you go in the process in your education, the more narrow it is.  And I was very bad.  I was feeling very bad because the master [degree] I could manage between physics and chemistry.  After the master, especially in Senegal, there was only two tracks.  And that would really have completely narrowed my view.  And so I was trying to figure out how can I still do something that still give me the ability to learn about everything else.  And so talking to him, he was a biophysicist and doing radiation biology as well, I mean radiation biology or radiation physics.  So he, we started talking about quantum mechanics a whole lot at that time, although I had some, a little information from my own.  And he started talking, and the more he talked, the more I realized that you could use--and I realized that later, you do have quantum mechanics in physics, chemistry and so forth.  So I started to see something that was going beyond physics, and he brought one of his friends and colleagues who was in France, who became my Ph.D. advisor.  So he was a French guy, and we talked one day, and I applied to the school, and the next thing you know, I get there.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, so who was this French guy?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Didier Isabelle, D-I-D-E--I'm sorry, D-I-D-I-E-R and Isabelle, I-S-A-B-E-L-L-E.  He passed away now.
Speaker 1: All right, and so he was your--
Speaker 2: And so he came, and we had dinner one day to my--at my uncle's house.  And we talked, and he mentioned to me about--actually, what the original thought was, was for me to go to France and do a Ph.D. in radiation physics, basically, okay.  And when I went there, the topic changed.
Story_ID: 20770
Speaker 1: University of Cheikh Anta Diop [University of Dakar, Senegal].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So I did physics and chemistry.  I did my bachelor and master [degrees] over there, basically.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said you didn't know Cheikh Anta Diop himself.  He was, by that time, he was--he was still alive, but he wasn't--
Speaker 2: Right, no, I never met him personally, but we did, I mean I did know, obviously, of him, and there's something that, at my high school, that my high school did while I was in college.  It was basically the science fair or the equivalent of a science fair, but they had a display of all of the students that attended that high school.  And Senghor [Leopold Sedar Senghor, the first president of Senegal (1960-1980)] was one of them, Leopold Sedar Senghor. And when we were looking at the grades, the guy has a A-plus in every subject from math, physics, history, philosophy, Greek, I mean, you name it, the guy was there.
Speaker 1: Senghor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--that's when I realized the guy was different (laughter).  And talking about him, we started talking about Cheikh Anta and the others, and that's when I also learned that Cheikh Anta has seven Ph.D.s.  Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: I did not know that either (laughter).  So that's how I started to get acquainted to some of the people in Senegal who actually were pretty impressive.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that is an impressive group.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  So, and somebody was mentioned, it's good that I didn't do high school with Senghor or somebody like him because you sit close to him, and you're trying to figure out a problem and the guy's still writing.  You (laughter), you say, I must be, there may be something wrong with me if I cannot solve the problem (laughter).  Yeah, there were some--those people were, and not only they were good, but actually, they stayed.
Speaker 1: Sengor is not only a president, but a poet, and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I don't know what he--
Speaker 2: You know, when he was eighty-one in France, that's when he started learning Chinese.  When I find that, I said, wow, but, yeah, he's very impressive guy.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were growing up, did you all discuss that generation of men that wrote, who founded Presence Africaine [magazine] and all of that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This was part of our education.  We learned that in school, and it also happened that one of my uncle was, I would say a librarian.  And, which was fascinating for me because he could name--you tell him a date, he can tell you everything that happened on that date anywhere on this planet.
Speaker 1: Oh, did you know of Ki-Zerbo [politician and writer from Burkina Faso]?
Speaker 2: Yes, we also learned--
Speaker 1: Joseph Ki-Zerbo.  So one of the thing that I mentioned to my students here in the U.S. is we didn't have a choice, right.  We were following the French system.  But we were also educated in our history as far as Africa and other kingdoms and all that.  So I do remember when I was in, it was middle school, yeah, I could draw pretty much the map of every continent.  I could tell you the flag of every country and not only that, we, in high school we learned also about the economical system, the political system and all that.  We learned about everybody, let's put it that way, right, which was pretty, pretty remarkable now that I'm thinking about it.  But we were definitely educated on all of our history and for Senegal, but (unclear), basically all of the people that, of course, a long time ago, fought all of the colonization and what they did and so forth.  So like you guys are learning about Harriet Tubman [African American abolitionist and humanitarian] and all of those, so we did learn that, and it was not a choice.  It was part of the educational system because they wanted to be sure we have our roots.  And as a matter of fact, at some point, Senghor spearheaded with one of his colleagues, they even start to realize that some of the kids actually were not learning, I mean have bad grades, but not because they didn't understand.  It was because it was done in French.  So they started translate it into the national language or their native language because we do have different languages.  So that they can understand better and actually, some of them started performing much better.  So, a lot of things happened around that period that, I guess is still in my head in some ways because most of the things that I'm doing in my profession and also at home, now, that I'm getting this interview, I realize that there's a lot of--a lot of this is actually transferring into what I'm doing.
Story_ID: 20771
Speaker 1: You seem to have a--well, I'll talk about that later.  I guess, that just because your world view as a student is so expansive, you know, and then I, you know, I realize that in this country, that is the exception.  Anybody that has an expansive world view is probably the exception to the rule, not the rule.  But, would you say that that was true--I mean when you were growing up did most students have this expansive view of the world?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Most of, I mean like the average student, most of them are trying to get a good grade (laughter), and pass the thing.  But, you see, my--and I mean I've been told by many of family members as well as friends, as far as my education that I see the world as a, how do you say that, too perfect, too rosy.  I mean nobody is bad.  You can come tomorrow and say bad things or dress with dirty clothes or whatever.  It doesn't matter as far as I'm concerned because the person that is behind that is different, okay.  But they were all, yes, focused on particular aspects as far as moving forward.  And I just want to mention a couple of stories here that stays in my mind also.  When my dad was a principal [of a school], and so as, I think in the U.S. you do have Olympiads [exams] in science or other topics.  So we do have also Olympiads where we take all of the students, and we give them almost an all-day-long test.  It's a six hours or eight hours test and four, six hours tests on math or biology or chemistry or economics, whatever the topic is in high school, okay.  And, of course, you get a prize, so it's a national event, and it's a very prestigious thing to win.  One of the students going to this high school was a girl.  And she was first in, if I remember well, overall, so math, all the science topics, she was the first.  But what was amazing with that girl, she walked about an hour bare feet to school.  She was doing her homework with a candle.  There was no electricity.  And for sure you can forget about her parents helping her at home, right.  And I'm pretty sure she was probably also cooking, like most of the young girls in Africa and helping the parents at home.  This is a story that stayed in my mind because of two reasons.  One is that, there's nothing that you cannot overcome, right.  Now, of course, she probably had some abilities, but also for my students here in the U.S. who complain or argue about things that they have or they don't have to be able to succeed, that's another very powerful story that show them, look, if she can do that, there's no reason that you cannot do that, okay.  So that's one testimony.
Story_ID: 20772
Speaker 1: The second story is, I'm not a reference in regards to being a student.  Why, is that? Basically, I used to, from middle school all the way to, all the way to my Ph.D., although I started to do more stuff outside.  I was working from roughly eight o'clock in the morning to eight o'clock p.m.  So I'd get up at six, seven [o'clock] and go to school, I mean sit down and work, even on the weekends.  So in Senegal on weekends, the schools are open, the high schools because they know that people don't have electricity.  So they open and you can go and sit.  And what's amazing, during the, even the university, during exam periods, final exam or mid-term, you go into an amphitheater, it's packed (laughter).  You're never gonna see that here.  And that's something that still is in my mind.  But so I was working pretty much, I would say too much.  That's why I say I'm not a reference.  My grandma [Mary Georgina Morgan Gueye] used to, at some point she just took my bag and threw it in a closet and say, "Paul, go to a movie, to the beach, where you don't work today, just relax."  But since middle school I've always been, I would say helping others in regards to education.  And I will always remember one weekend, I walk into a room in my high school on the weekend.  There was one student sitting inside.  And I walk inside and the first thing that he said, he just burst.  Paul, you're here, yes.  I'm so glad to see you.  You know, each time you come in the room, the room just light up.  I said, well, what the (laugher), what are you saying?  Well, I have this problem and so forth.  I said, okay, what's your problem.  And he showed me, I explained to him, and he (unclear) says, see, that's what happened.  That's why you--and that stayed also in my mind because I don't know if that was the point or not, but that's when I realized that, okay, it looks like maybe I have something that I can pass along.
Speaker 2: So you felt like you might be a teacher?
Speaker 1: I'd been teaching since I was in middle school.  And one of the events that really showed me that something, I must be doing something right somewhere is two of my cousins fell behind, right.  I mean if you don't pass.  What I did with them, I said, okay.  We took one summer.  We went through the entire program, and one of them was in--so I mentioned there's three years in middle school before you go to high school.  At the end, you pass an exam to go to high school.  So one of them was in the final year.  The other one was the year before, okay.  So I took them over the summer and we went over the, the last year in middle school program in science, history and all that.  I mean it's just, everybody can do that more or less on their own.  But science sometimes, it's, you get stuck whether it's math or whatever.  But we did math and biology and chemistry or whatever the science was at that time.  And they sign up for the exam, and they pass it.  And when they pass it, so one of them went forward.  The other one skip one class and they were actually in the top when they were moving forward.  So--
Speaker 2: Now, that's a great record.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It's, well, some people may see it like this.  I see it more as a--again, whatever we know, we have to pass it.  And if I have a way to do it, I'll do.  If somebody else has a better way, that's fine too, but I'm gonna make everything possible that I can to, again, remember what I mentioned earlier, I try to have everybody moving forward to the highest level possible.  So.
Story_ID: 20773
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how was--let me ask you this before we get you out of Cheikh Anta Diop University [University of Cheikh Anta Diop, University of Dakar, Senegal], how was that different from college here at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: What do you mean?  I (unclear) the question?
Speaker 1: Well, how was Cheikh Anta Diop University different from, you know, college here, say at Hampton or any place else in the United States?
Speaker 2: Well, Number One, you don't have all of the infrastructure, okay.
Speaker 1: Meaning what?
Speaker 2: You go into a lab here, you can find (unclear), you can find a tool, any, not all the tools, but some tools to do something over there.
Speaker 1: So the physical resources are--
Speaker 2: Oh, the physical resource is not there.  I mean and that's across Africa.  The labs are empty or you're dealing with equipment that have been there for fifty years.  I mean the lab that I used to do, they're still doing the same lab with the same equipment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that tells you basically the status.  And even going backwards now because of the fact that the world is evolving even faster than what it used to be.
Speaker 1: So that--
Speaker 2: Fast technology.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so does that mean then you have to learn about things without experiment--doing the experiments.
Speaker 2: Which is what the big issue is in Africa is that every student that come from Africa and get to the U.S., as far as the theory is concerned, they're usually way on top of the class, I mean, and I always tell them actually, you cannot tell me it's hard or you cannot tell you don't know the topic, because they learn it, and they can deliver--it doesn't matter where they go in the world, the hands-on aspect, that's where they're really lacking because there's nothing.  And so for something simple, something that would make, that would seem simple here in the U.S. or straightforward that you even can see in elementary school, they may not have it over there or they don't have it.
Speaker 1: So you would actually understand things that you've never seen demonstrated.  You could have an understanding of something without, I mean--
Speaker 2: If you give me a book with some equation, I can derive it.  You give me, but--well, let me step back.  There are a few that I will not be able to do obviously, that another person from the same generation or well, to put the thing in perspective, will be able to do it.  Or another student would not be able to do it.  So I'm somewhere in the middle or whatever on that scale.  But the point that I'm trying to make here is that the theoretical foundation is there, and now it's up to us to bring it wherever we want to bring it.  Example, when I went to France for my Ph.D., I did a Ph.D. in nuclear physics, I never learn about cross section, nuclear models, some advanced statistical analysis, just based on statistics.  So this was completely new and the worse is that the students who were in the, in my class, my classmates actually went through it before.  So there was two issues, right.  Either I said goodbye and I choose something that I know I can focus on or I just buy the books and learn myself, which is what I did.
Story_ID: 20774
Speaker 1: Anything else about the University of Cheikh Anta Diop [University of Dakar, Senegal]?
Speaker 2: So it's, so the environment was actually awesome.  But again, I'm not the reference 'cause I just love, (laughter) love to learn and love the thing.  But let me give you a couple of perspective.  My first year in college, the first year in physics, we were 500 students, okay.  Now, first year, you probably have ten or twenty [in the U.S.]. 500 physics students, I mean physics and chemistry (unclear).  Now, I've heard that there are about 2,000.  So that shows you the, well, it's an issue because you got too many students at the university, but it's more of a global issue as far as infrastructure is again, and so forth.  But being, going from high school to a college where you're in twenty, thirty students to a 500, yeah, 500 class students, that's always something which is okay, what do you do here, right?
Speaker 1: So this is 500 in the same classroom?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: First-year students in physics, that's how many we were.  And, of course, the more you go, the more it starts going down, obviously.  But for me that was great because that means 500 people that I can meet and interact with.  And we did do that.  We worked with each other.  It was a, it was great, and as I mentioned, I was working with that friend of mine who was in math/physics.  And so he was doing math/physics, I was doing physics/chemistry, but we--the physics were more or less the same.  And if I had a problem in math, I mean I just ask him.  Actually, this one, this particular person also was a very particular person, talking about stories.  He was Muslim, as I mentioned, and I was a Christian.  But he had an elephant memory.  When you're in school, it's a matter of repetition, so you do problems after problems to be sure you understand the process.  And some of the problems in science is prove this, prove that.  So just to give you the knowledge on how to solve a particular topic; what was amazing with him is that, although they were practice problems, he remembered the questions and the answer.  So when he has a test or homework, he said, ah, hah, I remember, I just proved that thing and if I use that formula.  So he is able to solve the thing in half a page, where we all do everything for two or three pages to solve the problem.  And I mean he was, actually, he became the first person who had a, the highest grade in the university ever and went to France and--but never ask him a question.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Issa, I-S-S-A.  That's his first name.  And his last name Cisse, C-I-S-S-E.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's another popular name.
Speaker 2: That's another popular name. Yeah, Cisse.
Speaker 1: With an accent [Cisse].  And we used to call him "Zeus."
Speaker 2: Zeus?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, yeah, very, very smart guy.  And very, very good.  But it was an awesome experience.  In chemistry we used to, of course, mix chemicals to produce whatever and measure the mass and so forth.  So that was great because all of the lab work was going from theory to hands-on.  So that was a great experience over there.  As I said, the fact that there was now 500 students, that means 500 people to interact with in addition to everybody else in the university, for me was something that I enjoyed.  And eventually, I became also, I mean like here you have, you become teaching assistant.  So having that transition and experience where you actually help setting up lab and grading is also something at that level which was also a great experience.
Speaker 2: Again, is the social--is school seen as a social scene the way it is here?  I mean in terms of--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --fraternities and sororities.
Speaker 1: No, we don't have fraternities and sororities.  That's what was so new to me when I came here.  I said, what's that?  (laughter).
Speaker 2: But parties and--
Speaker 1: But parties, parties are always there, not on campus, but mainly in somebody's house, although on campus, what you have is mainly the tea, again.  So people will gather in somebody's room and go outside and we'll have fun, drinking, talking and all that.
Speaker 2: So I take it the consumption of alcohol is not done--
Speaker 1: No, alcohol is not--some people will drink, but it's not something that people do on campus.  It's more, well, as far as I remember (laughter), at least with my generation, it was mainly sodas and tea and water, but no alcohol.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 20775
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so were you involved in any organizations on campus [University of Cheikh Anta Diop/University of Dakar, Senegal]?
Speaker 2: No, because we don't have physics societies or things like this, but one thing that I was involved was actually music.  Could we just talk about music, and I started in high school.  So I was part of a band, and we were playing Reggae music, Jazz, R and B [rhythm and blues] and things like this.  I'm a drummer.  I was the drummer and so I did the background.
Speaker 1: You played the trap drums with the sticks?
Speaker 2: The regular drum, yeah.  And also going a bit even back with my twin brother [Rene Gueye], we used to teach Sunday school, okay, so, to the kids.  And one of the thing that we implemented and they loved it was having the kids to sing.  So, not only they were doing the plays, but we were playing the instruments behind.  So that's something that we grew up (unclear) until I left, basically.  Going into college, I started doing, that was more Judo and Viet Vo Dao [Vovinam], the martial arts.  So while I was still doing like any others playing football on the weekends with friends and so forth all during the week, once in a while, but martial art was now more of my extracurricular activity.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was the--who were the, I guess the popular musicians when you were in college?
Speaker 2: It was Youssou Ndour.  He's still--
Speaker 1: Youssou Ndour, yeah, he's one of the most popular musicians in the world.
Speaker 2: As popular as ever, yes (laughter).  That's true.  And, yeah, he's the one that's really, yeah, he's known all across the board.
Speaker 1: Okay, anybody else?
Speaker 2: There was also Ismail Lo.  He's playing, he's somebody who played guitar but also the harmonica.  And he always do a very soft music.  So those are the two that I remember the most.  And there were others, of course.  There's always many others that, Mantena Setalevo (ph.), but those are the two that really stayed for a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay, Okay.
Story_ID: 20776
Speaker 1: So when you graduated from Cheikh Anta Diop University [University of Cheikh Anta Diop/University of Dakar, Senegal], now was that a big ceremony or do they make a big deal out of that?
Speaker 2: No, they did not make a big deal because again the, there's no incentive to, to go forward like it is in the U.S., where my son graduated from whatever, middle school, in college and high school, in--.  We don't have that.  So it's the family that nurture you in regards to going forward in education, and yes, they're gonna tell you all the values of having an education, how important it is.  But the environment is set up so that you really, as I said, you keep going.
Speaker 1: Now, did your brother [Rene Gueye] go to school with you at [University of] Cheikh Anta Diop?
Speaker 2: Yes, my brother, yes, so he did--of course, he's not a physicist (laughter).  So he did pharmacy first, but he didn't finish that.  It looks like it was not his thing.  And now he's, he's more business.  He's working in a company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's very good at that.
Speaker 1: Is he running like a pharmacy?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, it's, how do you say that, when you look for oil and, or water on the ground.  So it's a company that basically bring the machine that basically dig into the ground and do that across Senegal.
Speaker 1: Almost like a geologist or--
Speaker 2: Not geologist.  It's, if you have to set up a water system or a, yeah, a water system for irrigation or whatever or even for a village or something that you are setting up, they go and find where the water is under the ground and have the machine to basically dig a hole and get all the way to the water.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's, that actually belongs to an Italian person, but he's Number Two in the company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20777
Speaker 1: Now, about the time that you were, while you were at, I guess, Cheikh Anta Diop University [University of Cheikh Anta Diop/University of Dakar, Senegal], you met Didier Isabelle [French physicist]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Right, and he encouraged you to go to school in France, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And so, what college did you go to and--
Speaker 2: So I went to the University of Clermont-Ferrand [Clermont-Ferrand, France], which is about four hours South of France.  That's where I did my Ph.D. at.  I mean my university was that one.
Speaker 1: Okay, at this point, you already had a master's degree, right, in physics?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: All right, from [University of] Cheikh Anta Diop?
Speaker 2: From Cheikh Anta Diop, correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was one more year that I had to do in France, after, it was full research.  So when I, so the university was at Clermont-Ferrand, and but he was a director of a lab in Orleans [France], Joan of Arc.  You've probably heard about her in France--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --this lady, okay.  So she was, that was her city, Orleans, which is about an hour South of Paris.  So he was a director of research lab over there which belongs to, like we have here [in the U.S.] NSF [National Science Foundation] and DOE [U.S. Department of Energy] and all that.  In France, there's something called CNRS which is the National Center for Scientific Research, where most of the research is being done.  So it's not done on--well, it's done on campuses, university campuses, but it's mainly done either by collaboration with them or they do have lab on campus.  So they are the driving force for research in France.  And so he was part of one of the main lab that has two accelerators actually in Orleans.  So I was stationed over there as far as working with him.  And my experiment was done in Paris [France], so I was kind of (laughter) moving around.  At the Atomic Energy Commission.
Story_ID: 20778
Speaker 1: Now, is this your first time overseas?
Speaker 2: Yes, for my--well, we did go to Spain when I was, I think, ten or twelve [years old].  We went for vacation, one week vacation, but with some family members, but that was it.  This was my first time in France.  Actually, the day I got there, I went to the train and I guess figure out how to get there.  When I got to [University of] Clermont-Ferrand [Clermont-Ferrand, France], everything was closed because it was after hours.  And, okay, so you get into a new world, what do you do?  There's nobody.  You cannot get your room, nothing.  And that's when I realized also how efficient and open Senegalese are.  So these Senegalese guys saw me and said, just come?  I said, yes, and where do I go?  I got my big bag and everything.  He said, come on, slept in his room that night.  And when I got my room and the few years I spent--I spent about five years in France, same thing happened to many Africans.  They get into a place and they have no idea about the process or they don't know people.  The Senegalese students were always the one that would always step in first, opening the door.  And, yeah, you crash in their place, and if you don't have money, they will lend you some money and so forth.  They were really, that's something that really opened my eyes when I got there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, how did the French people treat you basically?
Speaker 2: Great, I mean I had a great time, but again, I'm gonna quote again my grandma [Mary Georgina Morgan Gueye], so you see how important she is.  She used to say, "Paul, you can go anywhere on this planet, you'll be fine."  And I'm very social, and I will talk to anybody.
Story_ID: 20779
Speaker 1: I mentioned that me and my brother [Rene Gueye] didn't like to have kids pushed aside.  When I was in middle school [in Dakar, Senegal], one kid was, didn't, his voice didn't mutate.  So he still have a very high-pitched voice, and people were making fun of him.  So we became best friends.  So I mean I was working with everybody and having fun with everybody.  Everybody liked me as far as I know.  There may be some people who didn't like me, I guess.  But, of course, I have to always, got acquainted with quite a few group of folks that we were always together, moving around.  And for some stories, again, I would always remember, I mean I mentioned the fact that I have to learn myself some topics.  And since Senegal, I'm somebody that would not leave the room until I understand what the teacher does because eventually, I'm the only one in front of my [exam] paper, right.  So they used to call me "Mr. Question," and that thing is always in my mind too.  It was a statistics class, and so one thing I usually do when I'm in a classroom, I very rarely look at the board and, 'cause I'm writing everything that--I'm trying to write everything that a person is saying, and so now when I have the drawings or notes from the board, plus whatever the person said, that help me to make sense.  So I was writing, writing, writing, and I was not looking up.  And I realized that there was silence.  So when I noticed that, I raised my head, and I see--I look on the left.  All the students were looking at me.  I look on the right.  All the students were looking at me (laughter).  I look at the teacher.  He was looking at me.  I say, what's going on?  And one girl said, okay, Paul don't have a question.  It should be fine.  And we kept going (laughter).  I laughed at that time.  That was funny (laughter).  That was very funny.
Speaker 2: Okay, so "Mr. Question", huh?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how they (laughter).
Speaker 2: In French, it'll be Monsieur--
Speaker 1: Monsieur Question (laughter).
Speaker 2: Monsieur Question.  All right.
Story_ID: 20780
Speaker 1: So you became interested in high-energy physics while you were in Senegal.
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So when I met Professor [Didier] Isabelle with my uncle, the plan was for me to get to France to get a degree in radiation physics because my uncle was in bio-physics so he is in charge--he actually developed up the whole, the--in Senegal, we have the Curie Institute to treat cancer.  He's actually the one who pre-started that, okay.  And notice some of the things now because of my interaction with that center, but it didn't really strike me at that time.  But, so he's the one behind that center.  So it makes sense for somebody to go over there in France and get that training so that after you can come back and really help out.  The problem with me is usually what I do in school, what I did when I was in school is two things.  One is, I never use only one textbook because, I mean the same teacher can come and give you the same lecture two days in a row.  The second day, he or she is gonna use different words.  Because these words are different, it helps you to understand better that particular topic.  So I basically did the same as far as textbooks, and some other things I used to do with Issa [Cisse; Gueye's friend from the University of Cheikh Anta Diop/University of Dakar, Senegal], for example, during college, he will buy a set of books.  I buy another set because we just optimized the money.  And now we got two or three different books on the same topic.  So we can do all the problems that are different, and they have to give us one of them.  It's impossible that they give us something else.  But it also help us to understand.  So, but one of the thing that I got used to do is encourage.  When we start, let's say we start the semester in September, okay.  By the end of September, I went through the entire text book for that class which means, now, I'm able to ask questions because I see the big picture for that particular class.  I see how things are connected.  So I can ask questions that, for me, help me to understand better things, but for the teacher, the questions that I put forward make him or her seeing me slightly differently, all right.  So it's not that I know the thing, but it's just that I learned something and I'm trying to connect dots, right.  But now that means I'm in trouble because the teacher has now an expectation, and so by doing so I also put back an expectation on myself which force me to perform as best as I can.  So, so all this was done on purpose to more or less push me forward.  So what this ends up with is that when I got to France, during my year of--I only have one year of school lectures, I asked so many questions and solve, I guess problems that they were not expecting me to solve that Didier Isabelle told me, hum, let me see.  We are gonna close--well, he asked me one question first which was, how did I perform when I was doing my master [degree] in Senegal?  So for the high school test--and this is across the country, right, so we have, we group all the students in one school just to take that test.  And we have hundreds and there are thousands of kids taking that same test, right.  So when I did that exam, I was the second of all in that zone.  When I did my master, I was first.  So I ended up first in my master, leaving the thing.  And I guess him putting the dots, there was a lab, an accelerator, a linear accelerator in France that were doing outstanding research and was the basis for nuclear physics in the world, that was planning on closing.  So they were doing the last experiments.  So he took me basically over there and said, let's do some nuclear physics.  The thing is closing, and I guess they didn't have a student at that time.  So they put me on it.  So I said, okay, I mean I was fine.  I went over there, and that's when I learned about nuclear physics.  I mean I had the lectures, but I saw the big ol' machines--I mean the big machines and also that's when you realize that people who wrote textbooks, you actually see them.  And so I was like many others, a little bit intimidated and all that.  The day we finished my experiment, what they did, they pushed everything aside to the rolling chair and start doing a chair race.  That's when I realized it doesn't matter who you are, you're still human.  And that was, this is when the ice was broken for me.  And now it doesn't matter if you're president or--we are the same people.  Yes, I have to show respect, obviously.  I have to be here a certain way, but I don't have to be intimidated anymore because we are all the same.  But that was fun.  So that's how I got into nuclear physics basically.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is in the--
Speaker 2: In France, at (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now, this is in the early--the late '80s [1980s], early--well, this is the early '90s [1990s] in France, right?
Speaker 2: That was the early '90s [1990s], yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: It pretty much was done in 1990, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 20781
Speaker 1: Now, what was your [doctoral] dissertation?
Speaker 2: Ah, so now we get to something relatively fun or, depends on how you view that--, but so my experiment was to look at electrons that you're familiar with and positrons which is the anti-matter of electrons, take those--and that machine was able to produce that, and bounce them off carbon and lead, okay, and to look for some particular effects that deal with nuclear physics.  So it was, those effects are named, called dispersive effects and Coulomb effects.  What they are is you may know that if you have two charges, like charge repel and unlike charge attract.  We know that.  So if you take an electron, the electron is negative.  You take the nucleus and you're going towards it, plus, minus, there should be attraction, right.  So when you come, you're supposed to go faster and faster, and when you get out, to slow down.  And some of the measurements in the past, they said okay, you go so fast, you're gonna hit that thing.  Forget about those effects because--and, but, of course, that is showing up, I mean there was discrepancy that people could not understand.  So they started to do more studies into those effects.  The problem is that sometimes the effects are tiny and for us, it's always good to have a big number so it's easier to see it and understand it.  So if you take a positron, you're gonna have the other way.  It's gonna be slowed down and when it goes out, it's gonna be pushed.  So basically, if you have the bump for one, you should have a bump going the other way.  So you have something that you can see.  You amplify the effect.  So that's why we use electron and positron, okay.  And that's the Coulomb, it's due to the Coulomb force.  That's the force that explains interaction between charges. And dispersive it with something else that deals with excitation.  Basically, if you, each time you--if you clap your hand, you can feel like they're warm, right.  So each time there's a shock or, yeah, a shock, you transfer energy.  And, but now, you transfer a lot of energy, you can break the system.  If you transfer a little bit, you can actually excite the system.  So something that can happen also is that you can bounce off and see that actually you didn't transfer any energy.  Actually, what's happening, you transfer it, the thing get excited and it give it to you back.  So you don't see that you did excite the thing.  So it's virtual excitation.  And why that matters, well, if you don't take those things into account, your calculation as far as what's happening is wrong.  And nuclear physics is trying to understand how the world works.  So some very fundamental levels.  So if you don't, if you cannot derive the formula correctly or interpret what's happening correctly, that means you're not gonna be able to explain how stars are formed and everything that we're dealing with in this world.  Okay, so if we're just looking at two effects, but what I realized ten years after I finished, actually, is that I didn't do one Ph.D. thesis experiment, I did two because those were actually two different, completely different experiments.  So they just gave me both of them.  I mean I was just having fun.  I didn't realize that.
Speaker 1: So they gave you two Ph.D.s?
Speaker 2: Basically, that's what happened.  That's when I realized ten years later that I did have two different experiments that were done.  And it took me actually four years instead of three years.  I had one extra year to finalize the, the analysis.  But that was, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay, wow.  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But when you're there, you're just having fun so that's okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 20782
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you tempted to stay in France?
Speaker 2: So when I finished, actually, as everybody was looking for a post-doc [post-doctoral position] basically, which means a job after the thing, after the Ph.D. [degree].  And it so happened that, well, I had a couple of offers, but it so happened that one of the former HU [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] faculty, Dr. Baker, [Oliver] Keith Baker [also a HistoryMaker], who is now at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] in the physics department faculty, was looking for a post-doc to work on strangeness physics which is a particular type of physics dealing with, let's say some weird particles inside the protons and neutrons. So he was looking for a post-doc to work on the first experiments to be done at [Thomas] Jefferson [National Laboratory or Jlab, Virginia] on that topic.  So I applied.  I came here and did an interview, and got the job.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean--
Speaker 2: So I was not really, I was just applying.  And after it's, whoever responded.
Speaker 1: Was there ever a possibility that you would go back to Senegal?
Speaker 2: So the answer is yes in the following way.  While in France, I also noticed how important Africans overseas are in the following respect.  Every student who were at the university in France that I knew of get either a scholarship from their country which is almost zero or support from the French government.  They were taking piece of their paycheck, send it back home, like Mexican and Hispanic group.  And I mean when you're in Africa, you realize how big a difference that is, right.  So my thing was, with that though, is that it's great, but on the other hand, you're not really helping because if you disappear, what happens, right.  And people now are counting on that, and it's an issue.  So after the first year in France, I started to think about how can I do something for Senegal and Africa as a whole that will be useful beyond just sending things.  So that's when I started to be engaging to international activities that will make sense to grow science and technology in Africa.  So now, I don't see myself being in Africa forever because if I do that I'm--well, it depends.
Speaker 1: Or being here forever?
Speaker 2: Anything is possible.  No, in Africa, I can go in--I could go back in Africa.  The only thing that I want to be sure is that whether I can use some of my connection and resources to make things happen, okay.  So that's my focus right now, I mean one of my focus.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think I asked you, or I don't know if you answered this, but did, were you tempted to stay in France?
Speaker 2: Oh, so, as you mentioned, I mean, after I finished my post-doc [Ph.D.], I just apply, and it was a matter of if something happened and conditions are there, yes, I'd stay.  If it's somewhere else--
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you know about Hampton at that time?
Speaker 2: Nope, which is also one thing that, I came to the U.S. and I learned a lot of things that I have no idea (laughter).  So Hampton I'd never heard about.  And the connection was through the lab where I did my Ph.D..  The, one of the former researchers over there was now the head of one of the experimental halls.  And so he made us aware about that opportunity, and I applied.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 20783
Speaker 1: Well, I know we were saying off-camera that when you got here [to the United States], you took a drive, you rented a car and drove across country to try to find out what America was about, right?
Speaker 2: It was, that was part of the goal, I mean one part of the goal, yes.
Speaker 1: So what did you find out?
Speaker 2: I found out something, something very interesting.  So the U.S. is an awesome country.  I mean the landscape, the--it looks like, each state is different although it's within the same country.  You do have the same difference that I'm still trying to figure out between South and North.  There's always, people from the South always have an accent.  In the South of France, I mean the accents are even stronger than the U.S.  But I guess this is probably because of migration and people going from East to West.  You're able to transfer the same language and the same tones in this way, but people don't migrate North, South.  So whatever is in the South stays in the South, I guess, and whatever is in the North.  But what I realized is, so the country was great, and, of course, things were huge.  In Africa and Europe, you eat, your plate is whatever it is.  Here, it's like that.  So that was significant, trying to stick (laughter) that in my stomach.  But--
Speaker 1: Our portions are too large, huh?
Speaker 2: The portions are too large, and but eventually, you get used to it (laughter).  But what was very, really an eye opener, actually, I did that trip because my, because of Viet Vo Dao, the martial art, the Vietnamese martial art, Vovinam Viet Vo Dao.  There was a meeting in Texas, and so with a friend, we rode from Florida and from here [Hampton, Virginia], went to Florida and all the way to Texas.  I realize that also there was a lot of discrepancies between African Americans and the rest of the country.
Story_ID: 20784
Speaker 1: Okay, you were, you learned something about African American history, you said, when you made your tour to Texas?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Yes, so basically, so, of course, we have, we saw Americans on TVs and movies and so forth.  And, but what really strikes me at that time when we went through this cross country trip is that, so we stop at each-(unclear) and City Hall and museum and we're going through it.  And when I was looking at the pictures, I was looking at the captions and could see first female to get a, to be elected as mayor or to become a lawyer or to become the head of a particular organization and what not.  And that's when I realized that all throughout that, those states, these were the first ever African Americans who owned certain position labels.  And whether they were low position or high position, but they could make an impact on the community and so forth.  And you look at the date, 1987, 1990, 1970s, and that strike me because back home, of course, everything, everybody's black (laughter) in Senegal.  And so you expect people to, who own certain position labels to just look like you are, but here, I mean it's a multi-cultural place and you have people from all over the world, okay.  And so all backgrounds, all cultures, and I would expect that you would find a mixture of a lot of people of different backgrounds, virtually every level.  And that was not the case.  So that really strike me.  And because of my involvement in the university and me being also always outreaching to the community and supervising students and so forth, I realized that actually this happen even from the education, from the primary education all the way up.  And so that was something interesting, and I'm somebody that as I mentioned is very sociable, and I mix in with everybody.  Actually, a person who is now the head of the physics division at [Thomas] Jefferson [National] Lab [Jlab, Virginia] used to say, I mean he told me one day--he was asking me an opinion on a student.  I say, oh, he's great.  Well, maybe a little bit of this and a bit of that.  He said, well, Paul, everybody is nice for you (laughter), everybody's great (laughter).  And so that stays also in my mind because that's true.  I mean, I don't see bad in anybody.  But supervising all of those students that I just mentioned also made me realize that they did receive different type of information all the way through the beginning of their school.  So, so I started to be more and more engaged into trying to see how can my knowledge, my connection, my stature--I'm not high.  I'm not somebody that can make things to change, but whatever I have, what can I do to help that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 20785
Speaker 1: So, now, you had just alluded to the Jefferson accelerator [at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory or Jlab, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes.
Speaker 1: Describe what that is and describe what your relationship is to that project?
Speaker 2: Okay, so Jefferson Lab is a Department of Energy [DOE] funded national lab.
Speaker 1: It's the Thomas Jefferson Accelerator, national accelerator.
Speaker 2: Yes, it used to be called CEBAF, Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, and it's been renamed Thomas Jefferson, Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.  And this is an accelerator that is fully based on super conductor, conducting [superconducting] technology, and it's the first of its kind.  And what it does is basically deliver beams of electrons and photons that have enough energy to get inside the nucleus.  And by doing that you can see how protons and neutrons interact with each other as well as what's inside protons and neutrons.
Speaker 1: Okay, to find out you've got to speed 'em up and smash 'em into each other?
Speaker 2: So you speed them up, yes.  So the, it's an accelerator and what that mean is, so the way--I mean I'm a physicist so that means like all the physicists, we're trying to understand how the world works.  And you have two approach.  Some that look at stars, planets, that's astrophysicists and try to understand why they're here, right.  So by studying their interactions and how they behave in space, they can get information of the fundamental questions that we ask as far as how the universe was created.  And you got the other side which is looking at the microscopic world and how you get from microscopic to the macroscopic.  So the other side is how to go from macroscopic to microscopic.  So if you want something tiny, to get to something tiny is not trivial.  So one simple example that I give to students is if I give you a bullet and ask you to put that bullet in the wall, it doesn't matter how strong you throw it, it's not gonna get in.  You use a gun, and what's the difference between the gun and you, it's basically, the speed.  So the faster you go the more you have an ability to penetrate.  You're at the beach, you run.  You do a race with a friend.  The one who run the faster usually go further, all right.  You get tired, but you got a bit of momentum.  But actually something interesting happens in nuclear physics is that if your speed is very, very high, close to the speed of light, there's actually a relationship that relates energy and distance.  It's like if you shrink.  So in other words, there's a wall, it's like if I'm shrinking, and I'm able to see the molecules and I'm pushing them away, and I can get in, okay.  So that's kind of a picture, but that's a good way to understand why we need speed, to see smaller objects because you get smaller and smaller, now you can get in between stuff, basically.  And now what's even, how do you do nuclear physics, is, so, okay, you get to the nucleus and now what?  So one simple explanation that I can provide is if we assume that this room is full of chairs, okay, and completely closed.  We've never been in this room.  We're outside, and I ask you what's in the room.  You're gonna say I don't know.  Okay, I can give you a tool to make a hole.  You're gonna peek into it, but it's like us.  We can see what's in front, and if we're human, we cannot see what's in the back, okay.  So you're only gonna see your (unclear).  Put another hole, okay, you can see a little bit more, but there's always a dead zone, okay.  You keep doing holes, you're still gonna have some dead zone somewhere.  So there's another way to do that.  And it's amazing when you realize actually that it does work.
Story_ID: 20786
Speaker 1: In physics, we have two type of physicists, experimentalists and theorists.  Theorists, for me they have the best life because they only need a pen, a paper and they can go anywhere in the world, on the beach, on the mountain and just start using all of the equation and theories, understanding of the world and just make up something, okay.  But that make up is basically trying to explain how the world works.  Okay, so they can give you a description of the world, and now it's up to the [clearing throat]--sorry.  It's up to the experimentalist to do an experiment and if they predict the number of ten on some particular experiment, and you do that experiment and you find ten, that means he or she has a pretty good understanding of what's happening.  If you're far away, that means they have to go back to the drawing board.  So now, the experimental aspect is what's fascinating.  So as I mentioned earlier, each time you have a shock, you transfer energy, right.  So if you assume you just have chairs in this room.  You take a ball, and you throw a ball inside.  The ball's gonna bounce off, right, and each time the ball bounce, it's gonna lose energy, okay.  And if you have a few holes around, eventually, maybe that ball goes out.  You know how strong you throw it so you know the speed.  You know how fast it's coming out, at what angle, but we've, what we know so far about physics, we can figure out how much energy you're gonna lose each time you hit a chair, okay.  So if you know how much comes in, how much goes out, the difference tells you how much you left in.  If you know how much you lose for one chair, you can tell me, oh, you got that many chairs, make sense?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Actually, what's amazing is that that's what we do.  We take a ball, the electron, throw it on a nucleus.  It's gonna bounce off and gets out.  We measure what comes in.  We measure what comes out.  The difference tell us about how many chairs we got.  It actually tell us about protons, how many of them we get but also their charge because they have a charge.  So you learn about the charge distribution.  Are they all everywhere or here on the outside, some here, some there.  You learn about a charge.  You learn about motion, how fast they go.  You learn about if they--what they, which direction--in other words, you can tell if you have a chair, chairs in the room, tables, human, if the human wear clothes, if they have red hair, black hair, you can tell all that just by bouncing off objects.  That's the beauty of doing nuclear physics and what we call "scattering" experiments.  That's what we do at Jefferson Labs.  So we learn about how things interact inside the nucleus.
Speaker 2: So you have instruments that are designed to--
Speaker 1: Yes, so the accelerator accelerate the right energy because you need the right energy for the right physics and you have what we call detectors to detect what comes out 'cause sometimes there's a bunch of stuff that goes out.  And depending on what you're interested in, you identify the right particles and the right process.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 20787
Speaker 1: So you actually work for Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], you teach at Hampton but you actually--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --do work for the Thomas Jefferson Accelerator too?
Speaker 2: Yes, so the way [Thomas] Jefferson [National] Lab [Jlab, Virginia] and all of the national lab works, is you have people that are hired on staff at Jefferson Lab, nuclear physicists and other staff.  Now, all of the universities in the U.S. and overseas can put themselves together to come up with an experiment.  So they bring collaborators or collaboration, if you will.  And this, plus combined with the existing equipment--you may have to build something new, but maybe what's there is really sufficient.  You basically build an experiment based on particular tools and the collaboration and make it happen.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so how is your time split between the two institutions?  Is there--
Speaker 2: So when--so I belong to Hampton University.  So I'm 100 percent paid by Hampton University.  I'm what is, I'm labeled as a "user" for Jefferson Lab, okay.  But the user is also some that do most of the work as far as, when an experiment is put on the floor, you need students to be able to analyze the data.  You need people to be there 24-7 [24 hours a day, seven days a week].  So that's when the collaboration kicks in.  Some people also have dual positions, so they're part Hampton, part Jefferson Lab or part some other universities.  So as I said, I belong to Hampton University.  When I came, originally as a post-doc, so I was 100 percent at Jefferson Lab 'cause that was, I was hired to do an experiment, I mean to work with collaborators on some experiments.  Nowadays, I would say that I'm roughly one to two days over there and the rest here at Hampton because we are building an experiment right now at Jefferson Lab.  So, and one of my students did a Ph.D. thesis on it.
Speaker 1: One of your students did what?
Speaker 2: Oh, one of my students is a Ph.D. [student] on an experiment that we are putting together right now.
Story_ID: 20788
Speaker 1: Okay, so does Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] offer a Ph.D. in physics?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Okay, now, see this is something I didn't know.
Speaker 2: Yes, we are one of the few, so the physics program offers master's and Ph.D.s [degrees] in physics.  And we were, I think we may still be the only one that offer a nuclear physics Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is, of all the black colleges, Hampton probably is the only one.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  We were the only one.  I need to cross check, but I think we are still the only one that offers a Ph.D. in nuclear physics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At least experimental nuclear physics.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 20789
Speaker 1: So now I have a note here that in 1998, you published the 'Dispersive Effects by Comparison of Electron and Positron Scattering from 12C' in Physics Review [journal].
Speaker 2: Carbon-12, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so--
Speaker 2: In 1999, it was the Coulomb correction.  So those were from experiments that I did in France [at University of Clermont-Ferrand] for my Ph.D. thesis.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: These are the results, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, all right.  I don't know if I wanna ask you to explain those or not (laughter).  Maybe I should--
Speaker 2: Well, it's actually very interesting that I find that out-well, basically, when I left France, I was, I did an experiment, if you remember that I mentioned, comparing electron and positron, right.  And when I came here, like every other student, I mean you finish your Ph.D.  You get into the workforce and if you got excited about what you did, you want to try to see if you can still have it, right?  So that was one of the first things that I actually tried to push here at [Thomas] Jefferson [National] Lab [Jlab, Virginia] was, we need a positron beam.  We need to do more positron experiments and the reason was, my experiment was the last one in the world that compared those two problems, okay.  And so that means good or bad, right, because nobody can say you're wrong (laughter).  So nobody can confirm what you have.  But I have something that was there now, and I wanted to do some more 'cause there were so many facts I was interested in studying.  But the effect that my thesis was focusing on are basically inversely proportional of the beam energy.  In other words, the faster you go, the smaller those effects.  So for Jefferson Lab which has energies in billions of electron volts, forget it.  It's just negligible.  Well, it turns out a few years ago, about less than a decade now, an experiment came out and was done to look at the, the protons, okay, how the protons behave in the nucleus.  Two different experiments, looking at the same thing should get a same answer.  There was a difference.  So for about a year or so people were scratching their head, what's going on?  What did we do wrong?  Went back.  Turns out, the effects that were neglected, we could not neglect them anymore because Jefferson Lab, one of the features of that machine, compared to previous machines, deliver a beam that is, how do I say that, almost perfect, okay, as far as nuclear physics, I mean experimental physics is concerned.  By that, what I mean is the following, previous machines--well, if you plug something in the wall, you have current that comes out which is a 60 hertz frequency.  In other words, you got something, 60 bunches every second, okay.  So that means what?  That means you got something when they interact, and after you have to wait for the next one to come to do that.  The problem with that is we're on earth.  That means what?  We're bombarded by radiation.  The earth is emitting stuff.  All of the electricity that we plug in produce stuff so that means there's a lot of noise.  So the closer those (unclear) are, the bunches, the better.  And that's what Jefferson Lab has been able to do.  So things are so clean that the measurements are so precise that now you can't see effect that before you could neglect; now you cannot, okay.  But now, guess what?  There is no experiment that have been able to measure those effects correct for that because now they're problems for us.  We need to correct for those.  We need to remove them.  But we cannot remove them because nobody has done experiment--the last experiment that has done that is mine.  So right now, for the past few years, to be able to correct those effects, people are using my data.  Everywhere in the world, they use what I have done and extrapolate to what they have to be able to correct that.  So it's pretty awesome (laughter), but so I hope I didn't do anything wrong (laughter).  But that justifies now this experiment that I'm involved at Jefferson Lab, which is positron beam.  So now, we'll be able to do more measurements, very precise measurements about those effects that I measured.
Story_ID: 20790
Speaker 1: So that's what you're doing now.  You're producing this, these positron--
Speaker 2: This positron, yes, the anti-matter of the electron.  And so the Coulomb as I mentioned, what the Coulomb effects were this effect where you get speed up because you get pulled in with the force, okay.  And what that mean is that for physicists, if you get a car, and you have an accident, of course, the faster you go, the more damage you cause.  And you look at your odometer, and say, okay, I'm, my speed is 100 miles per hour.  The problem is that when you try to estimate the damage, you forget that, yeah, you come at 100 miles an hour, but now your burst is actually pulling you.  So when you hit, you hit with a higher velocity so damage is higher.  That's the correction that we don't have, okay, and it's due to the fact that you get pulled in.  That's the Coulomb force.  So that's Coulomb corrections.  The dispersive [effects] is something that deals with excitation, okay.  But that's the type of correction that you need to include.  Otherwise, you don't have the right information to predict the physics process.  Okay, so that's what my experiment did, is basically taking into account that speed.  And if you don't take it into account, your calculation is--I mean your prediction is completely wrong.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you need to be close to something like the Thomas Jefferson Accelerator [at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory or Jlab, Virginia] to be able to do it.
Speaker 2: Yes, you need an accelerator that has sufficient energy at that level to be able to see that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, how does it work?  Do you have to schedule time on the, with the accelerator?
Speaker 2: Yes, the way it works, yes.  There is, so you come up with an idea, and there's a panel.  You need to convince that panel that what you think is worth doing because, yeah, it's worth doing, and you get scheduled during the calendar year based on other experiments as well, right, because maybe there's some optimization, I mean there's some optimization that needs to be done so maybe more than one person can run at the same time.  If you want that beam, well, we cannot give it to you now because that beam has to be put in a certain, with certain parameters for those guys.  So just, we put you further or we put you a little bit earlier and so forth.  But, yeah, you have to be part of scheduling process after you get approved with your experiment.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Yeah, it's like the astrophysicists have to schedule time on the big telescopes.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  And, but the filtering, right, which is going through that review because this is expensive equipment, and when you turn them on, it's also expensive because you need to pay for electricity and the manpower and all that.  So you need to be sure you have, you understand every detail of what you want to do or as much as possible to show that, yes, you can do it, and you can do it to the level that you said you're gonna do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Don't want to the, waste the--
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 20791
Speaker 1: So having this accelerator here [Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory or Jlab, Virginia] makes it possible for Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] to have a Ph.D. program [in physics].
Speaker 2: That is correct.  Actually, when the physics department was launched, the driving force was optics, actually, okay, with a master's [degree program] that they have at that time.  And after, you went into the Ph.D., but it was optics that was really driving the physics program.  Jefferson Lab being built, the nuclear physics started to kick in, and now we, we've been one of the most dominant force as far as providing research and also funding for students and everything else in the department.  Now, it looks like optics is coming back again, so that's good.  So now, we're all going back up.  So it's been an awesome opportunity for Hampton University, and, as a matter of fact, most of the universities in the area.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how many--I guess, not how many but tell us about some of the Ph.D.s who have come out of your program here?
Speaker 2: At Hampton University?
Speaker 1: Yeah, or that you've guided through.  I mean who, you know, who are the some of the Ph.D.s--
Speaker 2: That work with me?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that have come out, graduated?
Speaker 2: So when I came, the students that were part of this experiment that I was hired as a post-doc, at that time was somebody from Romania, a person from Romania, is now at, James Madison University [Harrisonburg, Virginia].  He's a faculty, full faculty over there.  He was one of, he was part of the first wave of nuclear physicists.  In parallel, we have another student who was not involved in that experiment directly, an African American, but was involved in experiment in the same hall.  So we were part of the team.  He's now the director of the medical physics program at UPenn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and he's African American.  There was another student who did his experiment in the Netherlands and came back after taking his data and doing his analysis here.  So also part of the first wave, came out of it with his Ph.D.  He's now with Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas].  He's a faculty over there.  And there were two ladies, one that did his [her] experiment on a follow up off of this strangeness physics program, and is now a faculty at Norfolk State [University, Norfolk, Virginia].  She's African American.  And there's another African American who finish up a few years after, and she's now at, I think she's working at the shipyard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20792
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the Medical Instrumentation Center [Center for Advanced Medical Instrumentation (CAMI), Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Ah, okay, so this was also something interesting.  So back in 2000, no, 1997, our former head of the nuclear physics group, Dr. Buck, Warren Buck [also a HistoryMaker], who's now in Washington, Seattle [University of Washington, Bothell], was collaborating with the University of Michigan on something completely different, a new technology that was coming up called "ultrafast lasers."  Those are lasers that have femtoseconds, ten to the negative fifteen second type of timing so you can see how things are put themselves together.  But can produce a lot of power, and it can basically produce many black holes with this type of power.  But the University of Michigan were the pioneers into making that technology available.  And one of the things that was coming out of it was a beam of particles.  So they took to each other and every--I mean the discussion was, can you guys come and just measure the beam and we can see how much energy we can get.  And maybe we can have an electron facility or proton facility or whatever.  And now, you're talking about--[Thomas] Jefferson [National] Lab [Jlab, Virginia] is a 500 million dollar machine that was put together, typical accelerator, half a billion to a billion dollars.  I mean they are big machines.  The laser is about 300,000 dollars, a million [dollars] at the most.  And think about producing the exact same beam with a laser.  That means in a room like this versus a huge space like CERN [European Organization for Nuclear Research, Geneva, Switzerland] and so forth.  So that's what was driving that technology which actually they achieved as of today.  Yes, pretty impressive.  You basically have [Thomas] Jefferson [National] Lab [Jlab, Virginia] with the one centimeter, you get the same energy.  Yeah (laughter).  But it's still in the R and D [research and development] phase, so there's still something to be done, but now you can think about universities having accelerators on their campus to do high energy physics, right, (unclear) the astrophysics, without having to go to a big lab and big machines.  So, anyway, so they were producing those beams at that time, and we collaborated and built a detector to measure radiation. 2001, I mean after that one of our colleagues, Dr. Kapel (ph.) was working with the detector group at Jefferson Lab, and they built--that's what we do, nuclear physics, we measure radiation, right.  So they built a device to be able to help physicians in treating cancer.  And there's different technology as far as radiation therapy, it is called.  And one of them deals with the radioactive sources.  It's called brachytherapy.  So she called me one day and asked me for, if I could build a device that could measure radiation so we can see how much radiation and where the radiation is put because this is information that they didn't have in hospitals--they don't have in hospitals.  I said, sure, and just taking our nuclear physics technology and just shrinking it to a smaller size.  And that's how I got involved.  So I started to develop devices and actually, we have a patent for that, to measure radiation in the body, okay.  So at least we know how much we're delivering to people.  And so I started that and a few students came out of it, and I mean I can go on and on.  I mean, so a very exciting field (laughter).
Story_ID: 20793
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you--in 2004, you became the co-chair of the medical physics section of the National Society of Black Physicists [NSBP], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, so what happened with the, my medical physics involvement is, like any other scientists, we send an abstract to the professional society that deals with that and go and present our results.  Got there, turn around, me and my students were the only blacks.  I say, that cannot happen.  And so what I started to do is my involvement with the National Society of Black Physicists.  I said, let's create a medical physics section and to start exposing those people in this field.  But to be able to do that right, we also had to go to the--I mean "we," means myself and actually, Stephen Avery, Dr. Avery, who is the director of the medical physics program at UPenn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  He said, well, let's go to that professional society and actually create a committee for minorities.  So we put that together, we put it there and I got, I became the chair.  He became the vice-chair, and now we had a committee over there within the professional society, and we created a section at the National Society of Black Physicists.  So now we had the bridge so we can inform the students, have them to go to the professional society and visit it, put the right environment around that.  That was 2004.  In 2006, we actually, for the professional society, we requested funding through--so that we can send students in the summer to get experience in medical physics.  Okay, so we have a program now that has been running since then where students apply from minority schools, so many minorities, and to expose them into this field and bring them more into this field.  The next thing that we also did, I went to the American Physical Society [APS] because I realized I'm a nuclear physicist.  I can solve problems because of my experience in nuclear physics.  But if you're material science, optical science, astro[physics], you may see the problem different and provide a solution.  There's a big organization for that, I mean society, which is the American Physical Society.  So I went there to create a section also in medical physics to expose people to that.  And we're actually writing a paper out of it, but from what I understood within APS, some of the folks over there, the fact that we did that, now the field is just exploding.  A lot of people are aware about this field, and applying everywhere which is great.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: Actually, we also have the first African American students to get a Ph.D. degree in medical physics, came from here [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], and she was one of my students.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think you--
Speaker 2: She's gonna be now at Tuskegee University [Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you've--it says here that you graduated two young women in Ph.D.s.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, so in medical physics, I--in nuclear physics, I didn't have any students directly under me.  I helped the students to come out, and there was about four or five in that wave, actually, six in that wave also as students from Hampton.  In the medical physics, I had about four, five students under me who graduated master's and Ph.D.s [degrees] and two more who're gonna, three more who's gonna finish this spring, but not under medical physics, under physics.
Story_ID: 20794
Speaker 1: I can mention one more thing actually about research and all that, so medical physics, actually we finally get data because we're looking for the, about how many was the percentage of African Americans in medical physics, and it's about three percent, but I believe it's actually one percent or lower, based on what I see when I get to meetings and across the country.  But, okay, there's another field that is actually even worse than that, which is accelerator physics.  Accelerators, okay, we use them for nuclear physics, homeland security.  They use that to probe (unclear).  Food sanitization, is used for that, looking for oil under the ground, looking at the, for archeology, archeologists' samples, even prostate, if you have any things in your body, I mean you use accelerators for them.  So there is a field that has a lot of application, radiation biology, enviro--but there's about five African Americans in the U.S. that are, that I would classify as accelerator physicists.  And, of course, I know all of them.  So one of the thing that is now my focus for the next whenever--and I wish actually I knew that field earlier because, again, it's touching everything--is that I want to train and produce small minorities into this field.  So what I did a couple of years ago, [Thomas] Jefferson [National] Lab [Jlab, Virginia] has moved from one technology to another.  I mean things evolve in time.  So the technique that they used to use to produce the electrons has now changed.  So they can produce a much better one.  I went to ask them, okay, that particular gun, that's how we call it, what are you doing with it now?  Can I have it?  They said yes.  So now I'm in the process of building an accelerator here at Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia].  That will be the first one ever on the campus of an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities].   There is none.  And out of the 700 universities that are in the U.S., you may find maybe ten to twenty accelerators on campus.  So it's a huge thing--
Speaker 2: Now, that should be--
Speaker 1: --so I'm very excited.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a--
Speaker 1: I've just moved all of the gun, actually last--no, two weeks ago.  So all the pieces are here, and it's in working condition.  So, and I already have about ten students and some Ph.D.s and master's [students] ready to--and undergrad, ready to work on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that's coming up (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: So the next phase.
Speaker 2: Now, it says here that you were the chair of the minority recruitment subcommittee of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and chair of the pre-college programs committee of the National Society of Black Physicists [NSBP].  And you've doing that since 2005.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So the gun is the next big thing here?
Speaker 1: The gun is the next big thing for me, and the gun is just the start because the gun is just producing the beam, and that's low energy, which can be used for, to do accelerator physics stuff, studies, but also material science.  After, I'm gonna increase the energy, and by increasing the energy, now, you can start doing some more applications as far as physics is concerned.  But it's gonna take, it takes time to put it together.  But that gun itself should be up and running some time this year.
Speaker 2: That's wonderful.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I'm very excited.

Speaker 1: So the, as far as the societies, so if you look at the physics department, HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] in the country, all the physics departments right now are in danger.  I don't know if you are aware of that, but they're either closing or merging, and some of them are already closed actually or merged.  And so we are losing our physics departments.  But if you look at the students, the minority students who get a degree in physics, more than half come from HBCUs.  So if you lose your departments--so, one of the thing that is happening around that issue and is that, so I've been involved a lot in outreach.  And so I, we did have a program under NSBP [National Society of Black Physicists] to reach out to schools, but I more or less expanded that.  So what I did is, like every other professional society, we rotate around the country for our annual meeting.  We gather and talk about the latest discovery and so forth.  And what I did is, okay, whatever city we go, we're gonna fly a couple of days before, reach out to local schools, minority schools and go and do demonstrations in physics, but also show ourselves and talk to the kids so that they can see that people look like them and they can deliver.  So that's what that K-12 outreach was with an NSBP.  And but since we cannot do everything ourselves, also starting to reach out to other physics societies so that becomes as a team effort.  Now, as of February 1, I'm now the president of NSBP, okay.  Yeah, so that's another, yeah, there's only twenty-four hours, but that's okay (laughter).  So I'm starting to reach out and ready to push an agenda to make more visibility about diversity and addressing that issue.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, you're doing--well, you've got a lot, you've a full plate.  You've got a lot of things that you're doing--
Speaker 1: That's why you need a team (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, right, you're doing a lot.  It says here, there's a note here about you teaching at the U.S. Science and Engineering Festival in 2010.
Speaker 1: Yes, so this is also, I don't know if you're aware of that.  It was a couple of years ago.  There's a group who actually reach out to science, I mean STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics] organizations and basically, did something awesome.  Why don't we all put ourself together on the National Mall [Washington, District of Columbia] and just provide a week, a full day weekend of physics demos and everybody responded very, I mean it was an awesome response, and so they did that even about a couple of years ago.  And they're doing another one now, but during that time, I also was contacted to be part of, they call it the 50-nifty, which were part of fifty people that went around to do specific demos and talks prior to this event.  So I was selected as one of them, and I had a great time.
Speaker 2: I see there's a picture here of you as a kid on one of the--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, one, it's hovercraft.
Speaker 2: Yeah, hovercraft, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that stand was packed (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, and as you said, you're the, just been elected president of the National Society of Black Physicists.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 20796
Speaker 1: Now, do you see yourself like finishing your career here at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] and, or do you see yourself going back to Senegal or--
Speaker 2: I see myself, Hampton is not--it's a great place to be.  It's not, how do I say that--it's a place where I will encourage people to come.  I mean it has awesome potential.  Now, there is the potential that we can do with this place is such that, yes, if I can make that happen and, of course, they're happy with whatever I'm doing, I would love to do that.  I mean that, would stay here forever if I can, I can do that.  I'm also in the position where I can make things happen in some ways.  As I said, I'm helping, building some capacities in Africa, for example and within the U.S. at other institution.  If that, if it happens that I have, I can be somewhere else and make things better here, that's also a possibility.  As of today, I mean I have this awesome support from the university.  I have this accelerator project, and I don't see myself out right now because there's--it's great (laughter).  It's an awesome place.
Speaker 1: Now, is there--
Speaker 2: And my goal is also to use that facility to really expose all of the other HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities].  I mean they're doing things, but one of the issue that we all have is infrastructure.  So if there's something here, how can we optimize that system and the resources around so that they can benefit from that.  We have the Ph.D. program [in nuclear physics] a lot of them don't have.  We can ensure that we can build programs where when they finish over there, they can come here.  I mean we cannot accept everybody, but there's a lot of things that we could do.  But, yeah, so I was hesitant at the beginning to answer because I don't know how to--my goal is to have Hampton, and I believe--I mean it's not "I believe," we will make that happen.  Hampton can become the best university in the nation, okay.  And that requires two things.  One is here to go up as far as some of the things that we can offer, but it also requires that everybody else wants to come here.  So where can you be to make that happen?  That's why I was hesitant because if I'm here I'm gonna do everything that I can to make that happen.  If there is another option where I can make that happen also, let's go for it.
Story_ID: 20797
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we always ask this question, and you're still, you know, in the middle of an exciting career, but when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Ooh, yeah, that's a tough one.  I would say [pause], I'm pretty excited about those papers that I, that came out of my thesis because I realize nowadays how important they are and how important they contribute to not only our understanding of nuclear physics, but the impact is not only what we're doing today, but what has been done for the past sixty years.  People didn't correct all those effects.  So actually, some people are going back in time to correct and see if actually we forgot to do that, using again, my information.  And there is plan in the U.S. for the next generation of accelerators and machines to do nuclear energy physics, where guess what?  You're also using that as part of the treatment into it.  So I'm pretty happy with that.  But I would not consider it (unclear) my legacy.  If I were to look back, I would say that until [cough], sorry, until the whole world is peaceful and everybody's having fun, and we all work with each other, sit down with each other and have fun with each other, every background, every country, everybody else.  I would not feel like I did something.  I know I cannot solve the entire world problem, and I'm not gonna claim I will do it, but I think the legacy that I would like to see is that it doesn't have to come from me.  It can come from other people overseas that we achieve peace and happiness and love and everything is just great, no problem on earth.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there anything different you would do if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: No, for the simple reason that I'm a Christian, and each time I found myself in a place where, basically, I was in a closed environment.  I do not know where to go, doors came out and which door?  Well, one door opened.  So in other words, God always watched over me somehow.  And I went into different experiences and that experience is actually, I realized, you know, sometimes you're in a situation, and you're wondering why, whether you like it or not.  But now that I have this accelerator project that I'm working on--and again, what I want to do with all of the HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] and Africa and the rest of the world, because of all of those different experience, I'm able to address things in a much more efficient way and put dots together or connect people together that can make things happen.  And this would not have happened if I hadn't gone through what I went through.
Story_ID: 20798
Speaker 1: Okay, we always ask this question too.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hope is that we watch more, how do we say that in English.  Sometimes the French kicks in and I'm trying to figure out how to re-translate again (laughter).  But we watch more, we pay more attention about each other, let's put it that way.  For example, in the classroom, we know that--I mean know now being in this country that some of the students come with not enough preparation, okay.  And, but it doesn't mean that these children cannot succeed.  It's just a matter of providing them the right path, and they can go on their own.  And they don't have to have a teacher anymore.  They can, they understand what they're supposed to do.  But this is not these students.  It looks like even the society, when people try to go up, we usually bring them down rather than helping each other out.  And that's something that I hope would happen for the African American community which is raising up to their challenges.  There are many people who went through more difficult time--well, I'm not gonna say that going through all of those issues that the African Americans went through in the U.S. is not a big deal.  I'm talking about, you can compare that to slavery or to what happened in Africa.  I mean there are--it's tough, okay.  And while I always feel bad when one person is hurt or doesn't have something and so forth, sometimes a team effort can help.  And it can bring you very far in the future.  So it's really about trying to, again, bring ourselves up and how high?  As high as we can, okay.  So that's my hope is that things get at the level where there's no more difference and everybody's where they're supposed to be or well--depending on our reference, of course.  You said hope and there was another--
Speaker 1: Hopes and concerns.
Speaker 2: Concern.  So the concern is really right now with this physics department issue is that physics is going--we're losing physics right now.  And I don't know if you know, but a lot of people, I mean a physicist can do virtually everything because of the way we're trained.  Some of us are on Wall Street.  Some of us are doctors now.  I mean they went into M.D.-Ph.D.s program or M.D. after their Ph.D.  Some of us are lawyers.  Just the way we get trained, we don't--we're not scared of anything, I guess.  And if we like a particular area, we're just gonna jump into it and make that happen.  So we need more physicists.  And this is also just for the nation.  Anyway, we need more scientists, okay.  And we also know that a lot of baby boomers are now gonna retire and look behind, I mean there's nobody else.  So it's worse for us, and if we don't have enough of us, and I--more so in the U.S., being involved in NSBP [National Society of Black Physicists] and other organizations.  Again, back home, everybody is black.  You come here, you see one physicist, one blue moon, I mean you're not gonna get excited about physics until--well, you may have a great teacher, but you get into an environment where you're the only one.  And usually what happens, people are trying to make the best to bring you all the way through the end, but sometimes by doing that, they're overdoing, and you don't feel comfortable anymore or whatever the issue is and after you quit.  So they're trying, but if you're, if you have somebody else, that's one thing.  The other aspect also is a lot of students are not succeeding because of, they're not telling the truth.  If you're failing or you're doing something that is not, I mean, we can tell them that.  I mean we have to tell them, but the problem is, either they don't have enough parents at home, I mean you know all the issues with the African American community.  And again, if they're in an environment where there's not a lot of African Americans, they're gonna feel like it's a racist term or people are coming on them because I'm black, you're black, I'm gonna tell you what I wanna tell you (laughter).  All right, and you better straighten yourself out.  There's no reason that you don't go forward.  So they have to do their part, but it's also up to us to make sure that this happens, but we cannot do that if there's no program.  And so that's a serious concern right now, and physics, I mean, I always say to students, you're a physicist.  You can talk about politics or everything, but people cannot talk to you.  Right, you are always the weird guy (laughter) in the room.  So bringing up physicists is awesome.  Wherever they want to go after, it doesn't matter.  You can do whatever.  But at least you have now somebody that has a knowledge that you can use to do good somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 20799
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family now.  Are you married, and--
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm married--
Speaker 1: --and have children?
Speaker 2: And I have one daughter.  My wife and I met, one of the former students, actually the one at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] was having a birthday party, I think, in a park.  So he bring, he brought his girlfriend and that girlfriend has my wife as her best friend at the time.  So I went there, and it was funny because they actually brought her to hook up with a particular guy, and what I heard after in the story is that she said, "Who is that little one with the, real short?"  That was me (laughter).  She said, I want that guy.  So okay, so we started talking and dated for a couple of years and got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And now there's a real African American baby that came out, I guess, because she is from Mississippi, actually.  And she's ten years old now, and she wants to be a physicist too.  I hope she's not gonna change 'cause she wants to do experiments.  And that's also something that I notice, which-it's good to have to a family for two reasons.  One for the, on my daughter's side, since she started school, I've been in her school doing basically experiments every week, from--I don't know how I did that, but I've managed to do that until today.  And not only for her class, but the other classes because I saw that she--and that's so true, right, I mean kids will follow their excitement and what they see.  And so if you expose them early enough and continue to do that, you may actually sparkle their interests to science and technology.  Now, on my wife's side, one of the--I have a big issue that my family is mad at me about is that my door is always open.  And as I mentioned earlier, somebody said that I always see people as nice, right.  Actually, there was a few people who came to the U.S. on vacation from France.  They were all from Africa.  They were from African descent, and didn't know where to stay.  Come on to my house.  I don't know them, just met them on the street or whatever.  I said, just come on in and sleep, eat, take a shower, whatever.  And that's how I am.  I'm giving everything.  Again, that's my African nature.  And the same with everybody else.  But, of course, the world doesn't work like this.  That's when my wife comes in (laughter).  She's a person who helped me really to, starting to say no in some situations where I would say yes all the time.  So she's--in martial arts, we have what we call the (unclear), the positive and negative, right.  So she's kind of complementing me in that respect.
Speaker 1: It provides a balance.
Speaker 2: Exactly, she provides a balance. Yeah.
Story_ID: 20800
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't want to be remembered (laughter).
Speaker 1: Not yet.
Speaker 2: I want people--what I would like to see is that, again, I mean but that's kind of getting an idea of a response, but things are going so well that we don't have to worry about something changing or something not changing.  It's just there.  And people just are evolving in a place where, again, everything is great.  So if you're in that, if you're in that mindset, you don't have to remember somebody because there's nothing to worry about.  But, okay, I need to give an answer somehow (laughter).  I don't know, I--my goal is to do good.  I mean I'm driven by, as I mentioned, this quote from the Bible, Matthew 22 verse 39.  And I just want to provide as much as I can while I'm on this earth, and whoever is around me become, assuming I've got some good staff, become better than what I am.  And, yeah, I guess that's, that's a tough question because I'm not--I don't have a mindset as far as leaving something behind.  I want to bring everybody up.  It's hard for me to look behind and say, this is what I want you guys to see and remember or whatever.  No, it should be--we should not have to do that.  So you should be at a place where everything is up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With everybody.  Nobody is--
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you for sharing your energy with us.
Speaker 2: Oh, you're very welcome.
Speaker 1: High energy physics (laughter).
