Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey. Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Marcus Rollins McCraven.  That's M-A-R-C-U-S; R-O-L-L-I-N-S; M-C-C-R-A-V-E-N.  Marcus Rollins McCraven.
Speaker 1: And is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: Yes, there is a story behind my name.  My great-grandfather was born in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky, in 1956, his name was, first name was Mac--
Speaker 1: You mean in 1856?
Speaker 2: --Yeah.
Speaker 1: Eighteen fifty-six (1856), okay.  I'm sorry, I was just pointing-
Speaker 2: That's my (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your great-grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: His name, when he was born, was Mac, M-A-C, Craven, C-R-A-V-E-N.  And when he was freed from slavery, he left Missouri and came into Iowa--relocated into Iowa.  And when he was registered in Iowa and asked his name, he said, "Mac Craven." And the clerk, so the story goes, the clerk wrote it as M-C Craven, and asked him his first name and he said, "Henry."  That's the story we got as children.  That's how that came about.  And there is a publication from Iowa that shows that.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  I saw it, sir, in the 'Iowa Magazine,' yeah, from 1968, it got the story.
Speaker 2: He went to school in Iowa and was an ordained Methodist minister.  He had a money-making job at that time as a janitor at the capitol of Iowa.  In that article that was in the 'Iowa Magazine' said that he opened a recession, with a prayer, and he also was an ambassador, but he did--he represented the state in a number of different ways.  So that's how my name came about.  That's what it meant, McCraven name started.  And he married--
Speaker 1: At some point is there a story about how he ended up in Missouri from Mt. Sterling, Kentucky?
Speaker 2: --From Kentucky?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Born in Kentucky, you said--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was a slave--he came into Missouri as a slave.
Speaker 1: --Okay, following the family he was owned by?
Speaker 2: I guess.  You know, I really don't have any factual information, but all I know is that's where he--he had a brother, John Craven, and so that--in Missouri there are Cravens.
Speaker 1: Okay, so his brother, who was left in Missouri, was John Craven, and he became a McCraven, that's-- in Iowa?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he became a McCraven.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you've got Craven relatives now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've never met them--any Craven relatives.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they're in Missouri.  Whereabouts in Missouri, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  I asked you what your name was and this is a story behind your name.  And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth, December 27, 1923.  I was born in Des Moines, Iowa.
Speaker 1: Okay, born in Des Moines.  Sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Well, I was electronic-- electronic scientist for the University of California [at Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and eventually ended up working for a power company and I was the vice president of electronic-- environmental engineering for the power company.
Speaker 1: You want to name the company for us?
Speaker 2: United Illuminating.  That's the company that supplies power for the New Haven area, Bridgeport, Connecticut, in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what is today's date.
Speaker 2: Today's date is March 9, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time, you don't have to give your address?
Speaker 2: You are now in Hamden, Connecticut.
Speaker 1: In your home, right?
Speaker 2: This is my home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27035
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, which we've already done.  But what I'm supposed to ask you these five questions that are lightweight questions and only require a short answer.  And the first one of these questions is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food?  You know, I don't really have a favorite food.  I like so many things.  I just like food cooked well.  When I say well, I like fine dishes.  I want something different every day. I like southern cooking.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color?  Here again, I don't think that I like any one particular color more than the one, but I like blues and grays for suits, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like spring, I do like spring.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I guess, Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 27036
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  We'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Buena Vista McCraven, Rollins McCraven, I should tell you.  She was a Rollins, Buena Vista Rollins.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: B-U-E-N-A; V-I-S-T-A.
Speaker 1: All one word?
Speaker 2: No, two words.  Her name was Buena Vista Rollins.
Speaker 1: It means beautiful vision, right?
Speaker 2: I guess my grandmother thought she was a beautiful view.  My mother was very pretty, and the name is appropriate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: You know, date of birth, I have those written down for you, but I can't come up with it.
Speaker 1: Was it around 1900 or so?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1900.
Speaker 1: Nineteen Hundred, okay, all right.  And where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Was that Port Gibson?
Speaker 2: Port Gibson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace--
Speaker 2: I can go, I can go very far back on my mother's.  My mother's father was a Rowan, R-O-W-A-N.  His, his-- My grandmother, that would be my great grandmother was Susan Rowan. And--
Speaker 1: That's R-O-W-A-N?
Speaker 2: R-O-W-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her cousin was president of Alcorn College [now Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi], President [Levi John] Rowan.  He was president for one long period of time and when he retired and they needed a president at a later date and they rehired him, so he was president twice of Alcorn College.
Speaker 1: That's in Mississippi, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's in Alcorn, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Alcorn, A-L--
Speaker 2: A-L-C-O-R-N.
Speaker 1: Right.  They used to call it A & M, right.  Is it still Alcorn A & M?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.  So, the Rowans go back--I have, not a family tree, but I have all the names of--
Speaker 1: We had a Dr. Rowan in Dayton [Ohio] who's an M.D., black doctor who was a Garveyite.  There's also Carl Rowan, a journalist, are you any relations to them?
Speaker 2: --I don't know.  I know Carl Rowan, but I don't--I never tried to connect the Rowan family other than President Rowan and--that's where my mother came from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we go all the way back, I guess, to the slave owners there, because I knew my great grandmother's father.  Recently I was contacted by the Rowans who live in Ohio, I guess.
Speaker 1: That's where Doctor Rowan was, Dayton, Ohio.  I think Carl Rowan was raised up near Cleveland [Ohio], or something like that, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know whether he's one of the same Rowans, but we were Rowans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Are, are there any stories about your great-grandmother about life during slavery and what she did?
Speaker 1: No.  I don't know anything about what they did.  I know my grandfather who was Sandy Rollins.  All I know about him was he's a farmer.  And I don't know--my mother's mother was a Jackson.  I have pictures and I had-- I don't know-- I can't go back any further on that with the Jacksons.
Story_ID: 27037
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Buena Vista Rollins] grew up in Port Gibson [Mississippi] and she knew her great-grandmother, I mean, her grandmother?
Speaker 2: Their family was very close and they all knew each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: I know that family was connected with North Caroline Mutual Insurance Company.
Speaker 1: --So were they agents in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: No, they were into management.  My mother's cousin was--one of the cousins was treasurer, the other cousin's husband was a vice president in North Carolina Mutual.  I never knew too much about that, but knew they were close enough to keep in contact.
Speaker 1: Okay.  North Carolina Mutual, that was one of the big early black insurance companies.
Speaker 2: That is, that is the connection, those are my mother's cousins who were involved with that company.
Speaker 1: Would they be Rollins or, or Rowans.
Speaker 2: No, they were, they were Rowans.
Speaker 1: Any other stories from that side, I mean, in terms of what life was like in Port Gibson or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I can tell you what life was like in Port Gibson, because I lived there for some period of time too.
Speaker 1: Well, what was it like when your mother came along, was it about the same as when you--
Speaker 2: No, I don't-- I don't know.  It seems that I was--both my mother and my aunt, my mother had only one sister, so there was just the two women, and my aunt had no children.  And her husband had a shoe shop.  It was Fred King's Shoe Shop, he didn't call it shoe shop, he had some fancy name for it, but it was a shoe shop.  So I-- that, that-- I,I know something about his-- that family, but--.
Speaker 1: --They are the Kings?
Speaker 2: Fred King.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27038
Speaker 1: One thing I'll never forget about Port Gibson was that there was a funeral home in Port Gibson, and it was The Marx Funeral Home, M-A-R-X.  And you entered one door, you entered the whites section of the funeral home.  Marx had a son by a black mother that he recognized and gave him--gave him funeral home business in the same building and that was another door.
Speaker 2: So his son became in charge of the black funeral home?
Speaker 1: So, blacks entered one door to go into their part of the funeral home, whites entered the other door, but the embalming section was common.
Speaker 2: They didn't want to let people to know that, though?
Speaker 1: Nobody knew that but that was a common ground.  I remember that though.
Speaker 2: That is interesting.  I hear so many stories about segregation that was so strange, you know, but the funeral home-- this is really an interesting one.  So is Mr. Marx Jewish?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I think he was.
Speaker 2: I, I, I would think so.  Okay.  Any other stories from that side? It seems that's an interesting town, Port Gibson.
Speaker 1: What else from that town? I don't--
Speaker 2: Now Port Gibson is on the Mississippi, right?
Speaker 1: Well, it's not very far from the river, certainly.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Alcorn [Mississippi] is located, I don't know how many miles, but very close to Port Gibson, and that town--well, I don't know how far that town is but near Alcorn there was a country store and it was called the Cohn Brothers.
Speaker 2: Cohn?
Speaker 1: C-O-H-N Brothers Store.  You know at that store they had everything.  Anything you needed you got from Cohn Brothers.  And the reason I mentioned that is because when I moved to Connecticut, from California to Connecticut, I--one of the first people that I met was a lawyer who taught at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and his name was Cohn, Cohn, and his name had been given to me in California as someone I should look up and would be nice to meet.  And when I met him, I found out that he was from Mississippi, the Alcorn area in Mississippi and that his father ran that big store, and that's where he grew up.
Speaker 2: Interesting.
Speaker 1: Cohn brothers. So we-- he in a sense introduced me to a lot of people in the New Haven, Connecticut area.
Speaker 2: That's interesting that that connection made so many years later.
Speaker 1: Many, I mean we're talking thirty years, forty years later when I met this man, and he died.  We-- we ended-- we were very good friends, we did a lot of things together, he and his wife.  Probably never would have met him in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Right. That's right.
Story_ID: 27039
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Buena Vista Rollins]-- now, since she comes from a college family, did she go to college?
Speaker 2: My mother went to college family-- went to college, traditional black college, Tougaloo [sic, Prentice Hall], Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, Tougaloo [College, Jackson, Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Her sister went to college and taught in the Port Gibson [Mississippi] school system.
Speaker 1: Did your aunt go to Tougaloo too?
Speaker 2: I think she, I think she went to Alcorn [State University, Lorman, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your mother, now what did she go to school to do?  Did she get a degree?
Speaker 2: She just got a B.S., I don't know whether--she left and moved to Iowa and she kept in contact with the school, because every year they came, when they were raising money, they came to Iowa, and she was the contact, you know, alumni-type contact.
Speaker 1: Did she teach school, or what did she do?
Speaker 2: No.  She was a maid most of her life.
Speaker 1: With a college degree?
Speaker 2: With a college degree.
Speaker 1: Now, did she work for someone with a whole lot of-- you know, very important person?
Speaker 2: Well, she worked with the owner of 'Better Homes and Gardens.'  See, my father was a printer helper for 'Better Homes and Gardens,' you know, he wasn't a printer, but I guess he put the ink on it, because he would always talk about those printers, the Cordials, I don't know how to spell it or-- I just know he was say, "The big Cordial."  So they printed that magazine and my mother worked for that family.
Speaker 1: Were they generous in terms of their--
Speaker 2: Well, we had a very nice home in Des Moines [Iowa], we dressed well, we lived-lived-- had a good life.
Story_ID: 27040
Speaker 1: What you're saying, from the chronology here, you're born in 1923, so you're six or seven when the Great Depression hits.  So, I know a lot of people say they didn't know the difference because they were already poor, but you--
Speaker 2: We always had food, car, I don't know what year we got the car, but I just remember we did have a car and what was really called a very nice home.
Speaker 1: Now, this is interesting because a lot of people, not just black people, white people too, lost everything during that period of time.  So you all were lucky?
Speaker 2: We-- We were in good shape.  Lot of our friends, in fact, people I remember, all professionals, lawyers, doctors in the little community in Des Moines.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have an aspiration to do something else?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't think so.  She was a--she was living a, I guess, nice, happy life that she wanted.
Speaker 1: Did she go to school to become a teacher or, or health care practitioner or social worker, or (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I don't know what her aims were.
Speaker 1: --Do you know what her major was in school?
Speaker 2: I guess she had a liberal arts degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right. Okay. Well--
Speaker 2: Her sister, Stella King, became a teacher in Port Gibson and she had a horse and buggy.  She'd get up each morning and hitch up, regardless of what the weather was like and hitch that horse to the buggy and she took off and went to this little country school and taught.
Speaker 1: Okay. This is something, what you're saying here, this is something--was it that unusual in those days for someone to have a horse and buggy.
Speaker 2: I don't know if it was unusual or not, it was the only transportation.  That was the only transportation she had.
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, you know, compared to today, everyone has a car, you rarely see a horse and buggy.  There is a difference, you're eighty-nine.  So when you were growing up, did you see a lot of horse and buggies around?
Speaker 2: A lot of horses.  Yeah.  But in Iowa, we had cars and she was in Mississippi, and she had a horse and buggy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of car did your family have?
Speaker 2: I guess it was a Ford.
Speaker 1: Model T?
Speaker 2: That sounds good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think they made one kind of Ford for a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27041
Speaker 1: Let me, let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Marcus Harry McCraven.  M-A-R-C-U-S; H-A-R-R-Y.  And he was born in Des Moines [Iowa].  And we skip-- if we-- Skipping a generation there, my grandfather--
Speaker 1: Well, we'll get to him.  I just want to establish the date of the parents first and then we'll go back to (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: --My grandfather was born in Des Moines, my father was born in Des Moines and I was born in Des Moines.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  And your father's date of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1901.
Speaker 1: Okay. So a year younger than your mother [Buena Vista Rollins]?
Speaker 2: A year younger than my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was born in Des Moines.  You know, I have written somewhere all these birthdays.  I have to give them to you at a later date, I can't-- but he was, you know, twenty years before.
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe 1870 or so?
Speaker 2: In 1870 something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have it-- I'll give you exact dates.
Speaker 1: And you said your great-great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: My great-great-grandfather was where the name came from.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was-- he's the one who was born in 1856?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So his son is my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And that's what we were talking about him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (we're?)--
Speaker 2: And he was-- my grandfather was a Pullman porter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was a Pullman porter, okay. Which was a good job in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was always on the road.
Speaker 1: They had benefits and-- at some point they did, I know they had to fight for them.  They did get benefits at some point, it was a job where you could retire.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he retired and, you know, he was-- never had to live a hungry life.  He had a home and he made enough money.  He had, he had-- he had three, three children.
Story_ID: 27042
Speaker 1: Your grandfather was a Pullman porter who was on the road a lot?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did he do a real long run?
Speaker 2: I don't know that.  I know he was in Chicago [Illinois], Omaha, you know (unclear), Nebraska, all that area, I know he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Alright. And so-- so what are the stories-- any other stories on that side of the family.  I mean we got the story about the name, but anything else?
Speaker 2: No.  There're no-- one thing, the other thing I remember, I told you about my father [Marcus Harry McCraven] working for 'Better Homes and Gardens.' And he retired from 'Better Homes and Gardens' and what a big company did for you when you-- after those twenty-five years, he got that gold watch, which I have
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All engraved on the back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The traditional gold watch.
Speaker 2: The traditional gold watch.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story--I'm intrigued by your great-grandfather's story, about how he moved and changed his name and all that, but does, is there a story in your family, from your great grandfather or about emancipation?
Speaker 2: No.  Never got a story on it.
Speaker 1: That's always amazing to me.  You're not the only one who doesn't have a story, nobody hardly has one, which is strange.  But think something that that big it would be a story about it.  There must be a reason for it, but-- But, okay, so, now your dad, he grew up in Des Moines [Iowa], went to school--
Speaker 2: In Des Moines.
Speaker 1: --Yeah.  So, did he finish high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know the name of his school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Some of the schools have interesting names, and speak to people who actually built the schools and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Well, I do.  I do.  I think it was North High [School].
Speaker 1: North High?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I think that's the name of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he finished high-- did he go to college?
Speaker 2: No.  His interest was making the 33rd Degree Mason [religious order].  And that was interesting because in order to get his 33rd degree, he had to go somewhere where somebody is-- can issue that.  So he came, interestingly enough, to New Haven, Connecticut.  And when he was made a 33rd Degree Mason, he was made here in New Haven and I ended up in Connecticut.  Now, one thing he told me-- I had no interest in being a Mason.  So one thing my father told me, he said, "You will never be president of the United States."  Now listen, when I first refused to have anything to do with the Masons, that was his summation for me.
Speaker 1: So that's what happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He said, "You'll never be president of the United States."
Speaker 1: That's rough, that's rough.
Speaker 2: I think at that time, probably, every president had been Mason.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think you're right, I think you're right.  So he came all the way to New Haven.  Now, was he a Prince Hall Mason?
Speaker 2: Prince Hall, yeah. Okay.
Story_ID: 27043
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents met, how they fell in love?
Speaker 2: No.  Other than, see my mother [Buena Vista Rollins] left Mississippi, I guess, right after college and she--because Iowa was a place where a number of black people went, because Iowa was a state that was supportive of blacks in a sense.
Speaker 1: It was not Mississippi?
Speaker 2: It was not Mississippi.  And somehow she met him there, and I don't know just how they met, but she met him [Marcus Harry McCraven] there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, since they both worked for ''Better Homes and Gardens,' did it have anything to do with 'Better Homes and Gardens?'
Speaker 2: I'm not sure of that.
Speaker 1: I was just wondering--
Speaker 2: It could have been.
Speaker 1: --Before or after she started working for (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: They both worked for 'Better Homes and Gardens' and for a long time.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Did she have a job when she went to Iowa?
Speaker 2: She went there to do some further studying or something, I don't know, she went there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was going to school in Iowa?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She had finished Toug-
Speaker 1: Tougaloo [College, Jackson, Mississippi].
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, it wasn't Tougaloo, Prentice Hall.  That's where--a school called Prentice Hall.
Speaker 1: Prentice Hall.  And that's in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I never heard of that one.
Speaker 2: Prentice Hall, make that correction.
Speaker 1: Prentice Hall.
Speaker 2: I'm almost sure that's what it is.  And then she left there to do, to do further work, I don't know what school she went to in Des Moines [Iowa], but she went to Iowa to do that work. Prentice Hall.
Speaker 1: Prentice Hall, now was this a black college?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It may-- It's probably closed now, I think, because I never heard of it.
Speaker 2: I'm almost pos--it just flashed through.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  That's something I didn't know about.  Okay.  So she was in Des Moines doing further studying?
Speaker 2: She met him.
Speaker 1: Did meeting him provide the job with--
Speaker 2: I don't know just how that--but they ended up both working.  She worked for the people who owned it, the president, and he worked in the magazine.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Alright. So-- And they got married about when?  You were born in '23 (1923)?
Speaker 2: I was born in '23 (1923), and I'm the oldest-- they only had two children, and I'm the oldest, so it was in the '20s (1920s).
Speaker 1: Okay, it was some point between 1920 and '23 (1923)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27044
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walk, how they talked, you know, what their habits were, their convictions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my mother [Buena Vista Rollins], of course.  I would say my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Why?
Speaker 2: Well, I like the things that, I guess, that she liked and-(I mean?), if they take after you, that means that you favor the same type of lifestyle--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that she liked.  Family oriented.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Good food, clothing, good life.  She liked, she liked--
Speaker 1: So, your father [Marcus Harry McCraven] didn't like those things?
Speaker 2: --Yeah, he liked those things too, but, but I think she-- she had a big influence on him.
Speaker 1: Okay, Okay. Alright.  She also when to school--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she went to school.
Speaker 1: --College.
Speaker 2: She, she-- she insisted that was her big aim that her children would go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, that's (unclear)-- I had one brother.  They had two children.  We both ended up going to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  At that time, my mother and father divorced.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: We were-- I was a teenager and my mother moved to Washington, D.C. so that I could go to Howard.  That was her reason for going to Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 27045
Speaker 1: I want to go back to when you were a little kid growing up.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Do I have what?
Speaker 1: An earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Memory?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, I can remember-- remember being little, being small like--
Speaker 1: So it's no one thing.
Speaker 2: --No one thing.
Speaker 1: Earliest thing that you--
Speaker 2: I, I just remember my brother and I.  I can remember the house, I can remember the things we did. The house--
Speaker 1: We were a close family and there were a lot of relatives, there were only two of us.  We had a number of cousins.
Speaker 2: Did any of them live with you? I mean, besides--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So it was just your mother and father and you and your brother when you were little growing up?
Speaker 1: Growing up.  I had a dog.  I had-- I liked dogs, my brother liked cats, so we had a dog and a cat that lived together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And one traumatic thing happened, we were out on the front lawn one night and this cat ran across the lawn, the dog ran--started up the tree and the dog grabbed the cat and shook him and killed him.  I found out it was my brother's cat.  That was very traumatic.
Speaker 2: That was your dog?
Speaker 1: My dog.  This, this dog and cat lived together peacefully.
Speaker 2: Until that night?
Speaker 1: Until that night.  The dog didn't recognize--the action was so fast and the dog just grabbed the cat, grabbed the back.  That was the end of the cat.  So you can imagine the trauma.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  This was your little brother, too, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, my brother is two and half years younger than I am.
Speaker 2: Now what's his name?
Speaker 1: Carl.  His name is Carl Clarke, C-L-A-R-K-E, McCraven.
Speaker 2: Okay, Carl Clarke McCraven.  And he became an engineer.
Speaker 1: He finished engineering and he worked for Lockheed [Martin] for a while, but he's in California and he was on a board of Lutheran Hospital and they had a section that took care of mentally ill people and they spun this off from the hospital and asked him would he be in charge of it.  So, he did, he gave up engineering, he went back to school and got a public health degree and became president of this mental health, mental institute, which is now still in operation in the Los Angeles [California] area and it's pretty big.  He became a very successful health provider, and he just died about a-- just a couple of months ago.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So it was just two of you growing up.  Now, what was your dog's name?
Speaker 1: Trac.  Oh, that dog, and I'll say that was a German Shepherd out there in IowaHow  that killed the cat, but the dog, my dog here in Connecticut was Trac, that dog was Ted.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, Okay.  I'm talking about when you were growing up?
Speaker 1: Growing up, Ted.
Speaker 2: Now, Okay, so--.  Can you describe--
Speaker 1: Right after my mother and father divorced--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't want to go that far yet (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was going to say that's when I when I got involved with--that's when I went to Mississippi.
Story_ID: 27046
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and smells--
Speaker 1: Sights, sights and sounds and smells, yeah?
Speaker 2: --Well, one thing that I remember is, is when I went to Mississippi when my aunt had that horse and buggy, and I fed her horse.  I'll never forget that smell because the food--it was a very pleasant smell, because the food was a mixture of oats and some kind of sugar cane or syrupy mix that goes with that and I will always remember when I finished I could smell that food, the horse's food.
Speaker 1: You said it smelled good?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it smelled good, yeah, it was a good smell, but it was a, it was a mixture of a syrup I guess, that came from sugar cane or something like that and mixed in with the oats.  Good smell.
Speaker 1: Okay.  More sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: More sights and sounds?  That, that one came to me.  I don't know of any other sights and sounds right off hand.
Speaker 1: Now, what about in Des Moines [Iowa]?  What did it look like did it have any particular odor to it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Des Moines?
Speaker 1: Yeah, or sounds to it?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't remember any particular sounds in Des Moines.
Speaker 1: Did you live near something that had a smell or, you don't remember?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Did anybody ever cook?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had food, now.  If you talk about food, I like the smell of food cooking, certainly, but I didn't know you were referring to--
Speaker 1: Anything that smells, right?
Speaker 2: --Kitchen odors.  Yeah, I like the smell of food cooking.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about sights in Des Moines.  What did it look like?  What was your neighborhood like, what was your house like?
Speaker 2: It was a bungalow-type house, one floor, quite a bit of lawn, front lawn, back lawn, side.  House just sat right in the middle of a nice lot.  Behind me was the next block, on the next street backed up to it.  I had a very good friend who lived in that house, name was Freddie Graham.  I remember (another?) a couple of doors down a fellow named Scales, Dr. Scales, and that was a very good friend, his name was Junior Scales, that's all we called him.  His name was Emmett, but I guess (unclear) one of the athletes, but his was Scales.  And then we had another neighbor, I remember the neighbor.  Glass.  This fellow Glass was a music teacher.  He's my brother's godfather.  And when I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], my brother moved to Washington [D.C.] to go finish high school, and he was there teaching.  And it turned out he was--my wife was from Washington, D.C., and this Glass was her music teacher, so we--
Speaker 1: Another connection that comes all the way across the country.
Speaker 2: All the way cross country.  These neighbors were very, quite close.  They always had parties and things together, you know.  I knew we children knew each other because our parents knew each other quite well.  They did their get-togethers together, and so we knew each other together.
Story_ID: 27047
Speaker 1: Other thing I had influence for going into engineering because in the extended family, my father's sister--my father's sister's husband's sister married Archie Alexander.  And Archie Alexander was a noted civil engineer.  He had the company Alexander and Repass, and they built, while I was a student at Howard, his company built the big cloverleaf intersection, you know, where you go off the highway in all different directions.
Speaker 2: In D.C.?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I--
Speaker 2: So this is a black construction company?
Speaker 1: --Yeah.  It's a black construction.  The senior partner, they had two partners, Alexander and Repass, Repass was white, Alexander was black, he finished Iowa State [sic, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa].  So that was, you know, being at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], having that job when I was at Howard, I was certainly in a position where I took classmates down to the construction site.  I knew them.  So I had a little in--I knew the extended family type person there who was the president of the company.  It kind of makes you feel kind of good-
Speaker 2: Yes, yes sir.
Speaker 1: --as a student, but that was one of the reasons I said I was going into engineering, but I decided not to go into civil.
Story_ID: 27048
Speaker 1: Now where did you start school in Des Moines [Iowa]?  Where was your first school?
Speaker 2: It was called Catell. I guess--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: C-A-T-E-L-L. It was a junior high--
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was elementary school?
Speaker 2: Elementary and junior high. Junior high--
Speaker 1: Now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a good student.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, math.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  Were there any special teachers in grade school that kind of inspired you?
Speaker 2: I don't remember them.  I had good teachers.  I liked my teachers, I know that.  I liked school.  I had no, no problem with school
Speaker 1: Now this is an all black school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  Okay, so it was an integrated school in Des Moines?
Speaker 2: An integrated school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any black teachers?
Speaker 2: No.  Not until I--after my mother and father divorced, and I, I went to Mississippi, and I had black teachers there.
Speaker 1: Probably old school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, okay, when you started out at Catell, okay, so you were, you were interested in math?  And what else did you like to do as a little kid?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked games.  I played just about all the different games.  I wasn't very big, so I couldn't, you know, I wasn't a big basketball player, you know, but I liked basketball.  I like all sports and I got out there and tried them all.  I was pretty good in baseball.  And I grew up as I got--by the time I got to college, I was too small to play any--to do it--I felt I wasn't going to be good enough in any of the sports so that's when I gave up that type of sport.
Speaker 1: Did you ever run track or anything?
Speaker 2: No, when I was small, I ran.  I was fast, I won races, but then the long legs outgrew, so I couldn't win.
Speaker 1: Did you like to fix things when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess so.  I don't know--I always put things together, I guess, assembled, whatever, toys or whatever.  I guess I, I guess I had a mind to see how things went together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you the kind of little kid who would take things apart to see--?
Speaker 2: I would take things apart too, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you read a lot?
Speaker 2: Yes, I read quite a bit.  So when I-- I like stories and I like acting.  I surprised my wife not too long ago 'cause I--we were looking, talking about something and I sang a song, It just came to my mind.  (singing) "I am a pirate, bo, ho. ho, I sail" let me see, what is it, I forgotten it again.  "I sail the sea" and do something else.  "And beckon me below, I am a pirate, bo, ho, ho."  And she said, "Where did that come from?"  I said, "When I was a little boy, I was a pirate in a play, I remember."  So you know.
Speaker 1: So, you liked acting?
Speaker 2: I liked acting.  I liked plays and reciting poetry.  I was always in school plays.  I could take a role in a school play.
Speaker 1: Did you like radio and the movies and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't remember going to movies that often.  There was no television.  That wasn't around then and-I, I like movies.  And-- Spent time in church.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was your denomination?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: And what was your church? Name of your church?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the name of the church now.
Speaker 1: Did you spend a lot of time--
Speaker 2: Like a First Baptist or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you have like a role at the church as a youth, like in the youth choir or usher board or something like that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I had a--I was active in church, usher, we had youth programs, picnics, things for children to do when we get together, choir.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) Were there any clergy people in your family, because I know your great grandfather was a reverend?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I never--as I grew up there were not church people.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't passed down to any of the descendants.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27049
Speaker 1: In junior high school, now, now did you a science class, proper science classes in junior high school?
Speaker 2: I had, I had all the math courses.  I was good in math, algebra, you know.  By the time I got to high school that was basically what I liked, math, because I liked algebra and geometry, all those.  I liked those courses, that's all.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now-- I guess I'm asking-- Did you have any science courses in junior high school?  Did you have like a biology lab or chemistry lab?
Speaker 2: I had biology and chemistry as I, as I grew up.  I've had all--in high school I took all the science I could take.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I was asking if they had facilities--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) I finished physics.
Speaker 1: --the proper laboratory facilities, did they have a microscope? (unclear), all that stuff?
Speaker 2: Yes, that equipment was available to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, because a lot of people didn't.  If they were in Mississippi, they probably wouldn't have that.
Speaker 2: Mississippi did have that.
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of places didn't.  I've heard lots of stories that didn't have any science equipment.
Speaker 2: Mississippi had all that.
Speaker 1: But they, they had it in Port Gibson [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. There were a lot of places that had none.  You know they had the book, but that's all they had.  So I always ask that question to see.  And I always ask people what level of math they were able to get in high school, too, because that's something that varies all the time, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, went to high school in Iowa, right?
Speaker 2: No, I went to high sch-- my high school year was in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Mississippi, okay.  Alright, so you went after junior high school?
Speaker 2: My high school was in Vicksburg, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Oh, Vicksburg, okay.  And what was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Magnolia Avenue High.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your, your parents [Buena Vista Rollins and Marcus Harry McCraven] split up about that time?
Speaker 2: About that-- that's why I went there.
Speaker 1: What happened?  Do you have any idea why they split up?
Speaker 2: No.  It wasn't anything.  They still became, they still remained on friendly terms.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So whatever happened--
Speaker 2: Whatever happened it wasn't one of these things that--
Speaker 1: --Did you see your father a lot?
Speaker 2: --Yeah.  We kept seeing--although they were divorced, we kept seeing both parents.
Story_ID: 27050
Speaker 1: Magnolia High School.  Was this in Vicksburg, Mississippi?  I thought your mother would have gone back to Port Gibson, but was Magnolia High School--
Speaker 2: No.  When I first went back, mother [Buena Vista Rollins] didn't go back.  That's where I went with this aunt and my grandmother were there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I got introduced to that horse.
Speaker 1: So you're now like a sophomore in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And after I finished high school, my mother moved to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about Magnolia High School, what was it like?
Speaker 2: It was all black.  So, all of a sudden I was in a school where there were no whites, that was a change.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it a good change or bad change?
Speaker 2: I would say good or bad, I still was a good math student.  I had no problem with my academics.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it didn't affect your grades at all?
Speaker 2: Didn't affect my grades.  It   affected--the affect was that I left a lot of old friends.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you were in a whole different situation, left your fiends behind.  Now was your brother [Carl Clarke McCraven] with you?
Speaker 2: Well, he joined.  He didn't go the first year.  We weren't together.
Speaker 1: Just by yourself, you were with your aunt and your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My aunt was a great influence.  My auntie was a teacher, and while I wasn't with people [unclear], we always had a lot of contact.  My aunt came to Des Moines, my grandmother came to Des Moines so this wasn't a new environ--the environment was new, but the people were not.  My aunt had no children.  That was Fred King, Fred King and Stella King, the shoe shop man.  They had no children, so we were the children of the family, my brother and I, got a lot of attention.  When I said now, I say we were very fortunate, two boys, no girls, just two boys and that was the only two children they had, you know.  My mother had only that one sister and I grew up around a lot of women, my father's aunts, some great aunts in Des Moines that had no children.  And they were always visiting.  They visited me when I went to Mississippi.  They visited after I got married.  These two boys had a lot of women around them, and I always said we grew up with strong women.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now what was--
Speaker 2: That brings about another smell, because my mother's sister made fruitcakes.  She started with these fruitcakes early on in the fall and you start cutting up stuff, citrus fruits and nuts and she baked these cakes and poured this brandy all over them, and then she wrapped them in cloth, I don't know, maybe November, and these were huge cakes, they were over a foot and she made eight or nine, and she'd send them out.  All the family got fruitcake, so you could smell fruitcakes throughout the house.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a good smell.
Story_ID: 27051
Speaker 1: Were you interested in music at all when you were a teenager?
Speaker 2: I never took any music.  Even if I had wanted, never did actually taken any.  I thought I wanted it.  At one time I decided maybe I'd like to play the piano, but I never took any piano lessons.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you draw or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.  Not to amount to anything, scribble.  I was fairly good with the use of the pens because I--in engineering school, I had to do some drawing, you know, engineering type drawing.  Oh, my handwriting was very good.  I took courses in handwriting.  I took Palmer handwriting.
Speaker 1: Now this is later on when you got out of school?
Speaker 2: No, this is early on in my life in school.  My mother [Buena Vista Rollins]--
Speaker 1: In high school?
Speaker 2: Before.
Speaker 1: Before, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: My mother, how she did it, it was called Palmer hand writing, I took a course and [making motions].  And everything had to come through those lines, you know.  So my handwriting, by the time I got into high school, I have, what would be referred to as some beautiful hand writing.  It's deteriorated quite a bit now, but it's still not bad.
Speaker 1: Were you interested in the latest scientific discoveries when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Now what are you referring to when you say that?
Speaker 1: Well, when you were growing up, I guess, they discovered something new then too like they are now.  Those things I guess would be like [simultaneously]--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was playing radio during my lifetime.  I built my own hi-fi system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You did that--
Speaker 2: I did that when I was older.
Speaker 1: --I'm talking about in the high school period?
Speaker 2: High school period, I like music.  I didn't build anything then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was wondering what kind of information was coming into your house if you had access to--if you ever read anything like 'Popular Mechanics,' you know those kinds of books?
Speaker 2: I did like to read, so I did do a lot of reading, I didn't specialize--I wouldn't go out and buy 'Popular Mechanics' magazine.
Speaker 1: I was just wondering if it came in the house.   A lot of time people would bring things home, they didn't necessarily have a subscription to them.  What about the newspapers and stuff--
Speaker 2: Had a lot of 'Better Homes and Gardens.'  The house was full of 'Better Homes and Gardens,' how to books and things like that.  I like to cook.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  So you graduated from Magnolia High School [Vicksburg, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did you run for class office or anything?
Speaker 2: No.  Now, the--I graduated from Magnolia High School, there's one year at Port Gibson.  So I got there and I had no problem with it.  I had such a good background there I was valedictorian.
Speaker 1: At Magnolia?
Speaker 2: Port Gibson.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated from Port Gibson?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Well, if you were valedictorian?
Speaker 2: They didn't have twelfth grade, eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: Got you.  I understand now.  This is a common thing, too, in Southern high schools that they don't go--
Speaker 2: The high school.  So you graduated from Port Gibson High School [Port Gibson, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: --So you were valedictorian?  Now, you weren't valedictorian at Magnolia?
Speaker 2: No, just finished that year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there any special teachers at your school that you remembered that really saw you as a person with talent and encouraged you?
Speaker 2: No.  I can't remember.  I just have to think, I guess.  Offhand I can't think of a teacher's name.
Story_ID: 27052
Speaker 1: But your mother [Buena Vista Rollins] was encouraged by your school work enough to move to [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  She said, "You will go to college."  And the way she could afford it was to move herself.  And that's how she solved that problem.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother have a job lined up in D.C.?
Speaker 2: She got one lined up.  When we moved there, she went right to work.  I don't know who she worked for there.
Speaker 1: I'm wondering now she liked the lifestyle she was living?
Speaker 2: We came to Washington, D.C.  She rented a place on 720 Boyd, no, was it Boyd?  It wasn't too far from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I could walk to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother suggest you go to Howard or did someone else?
Speaker 2: No, I went to Howard.
Speaker 1: No.  Did your mother suggest that you go to Howard when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was her idea?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was her idea.  I didn't have an application at any other school.  That was the only, unlike the youngsters today, they have applications to all these different schools, well, I think she thought in terms of black colleges, universities, that was number, and that's where she wanted me to be.  That's so I could go to the best college.  She didn't think of white schools, Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and all that.  She--her vision, I guess was limited in that sense.  But Howard was a top black school.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you want to be when you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: I was already thinking about engineering.  So I went there, my application to Howard was the engineering school.  I was accepted right away.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you choose a major right away?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started out with knowing I wanted to be in electrical engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay, so who was in charge of that department and who were the teachers in electrical engineering?
Speaker 2: At Howard?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Lee J. (Parnell?) was dean of the electrical engineering department.   A fellow name Howard was head of the mechanical engineering department and Daniels was my teacher--see you took some of all of the engineering courses.  The civil engineering was Dr. Daniels and he finished Iowa State, so you know we had a connection right away with him, I liked him very much.
Story_ID: 27053
Speaker 1: This is 1940?
Speaker 2: '42 [1942], '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: Okay.  1942, okay.  This is-- World War II is underway.
Speaker 2: I registered at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], was only at Howard for a few months when I was drafted.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I asked the draft board to allow me to finish my freshman year, and they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was drafted while in my freshman year, but allowed to complete my freshman year.  And then I went into the Army.
Speaker 1: So this would have been 1943?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so I came out of the Army in '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: So '43 [1943], when you went into the Army, this is during the War [World War II], right?--
Speaker 2: I graduated in '49 [1949].  So I got out of the Army in '46 [1946], got three years to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: GI Bill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated from Howard in 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Married in '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: Okay.  In the Army, though, World War II you were sent to Papau, New Guinea?
Speaker 2: Papau, New Guinea.
Speaker 1: What unit were you in?
Speaker 2: 1312 Army Engineers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Regimen.
Speaker 1: And what did you do in Papau, New Guinea?
Speaker 2: I, I was a non-commission--I was a corporal in the supply area.  The Army engineers built bridges and roadways for barges they had to go through.  It was a backup for fighting people, I never fought.  I finished my training and I was an expert rifleman.  So I got in my pocket right now, I got this discharge, expert, very good-- I can hit anything with a N-1 rifle.  And you had to learn to tear them down like you're blindfolded (unclear).
Speaker 1: You're in World War II, this is the segregated Army.
Speaker 2: Yep, had white officers and black--had one black, one black lieutenant.  And so, I got my--I finished my basic training with my expert riflemanship and then that's when they took all my bullets.  So when I left the United States to go to the Pacific to get into the War, I went with an empty rifle.
Speaker 1: So then they took your bullets from you?
Speaker 2: They took my bullets.
Speaker 1: I suppose the rest of the unit too, they took the bullets?
Speaker 2: No blacks soldier--
Speaker 1: Had bullets?
Speaker 2: --had bullets.
Speaker 1: Now why--?
Speaker 2: We had empty rifles.  We went through all the, I won't say-- but my regimen, the ones I know about, we had no bullets.
Story_ID: 27054
Speaker 1: Why do you think that--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: --strategy was used?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  That means we couldn't shoot anybody.  We couldn't shoot each other, I guess.  I don't know.  It was a segregated Army.
Speaker 1: So do you think there was a concern on the part of the Army that (simultaneously) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I think they can handle these blacks with no bullets.  I, I went-- when I got ready to get discharged, I had all these battle points.  You know you got--the way you get discharge is if you're in a battle areas, you know you get so many points.  So I gained big in New Guinea and the Philippines.  I was always in a battle area because we were backing up providing services for the fighting part of the military.  So I got the same battle points, so I was able to get out of the Army right after the--when the Army--when the war was declared over.  I was one of the early discharges.
Speaker 1: --Now, on a serious note, this is really almost the nadir of race relations in the United States.
Speaker 2: I had no-- I was an expert rifleman with no bullets for my entire service after training.  I had bullets when I was training, because only when I was training, because that's when I could learn to shoot.  But when I finished my basic training, given my rifle, and sent overseas, all I had to do every day is keep my rifle clean.  You had a certain period of time that you worked on that rifle, you kept it cleaned, barrow cleaned, polish shine, because you were on a desert.  It has to be ready to use, but I had no bullets for that whole period.  I never got another bullet.  I was discharged without a bullet.
Speaker 1: Now what--
Speaker 2: Now, you figure out why.
Speaker 1: --I hear that.  What projects did you work on, did you build bridges?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we built bridges, roadways.  I was in the supply end.  I went out in--we had--we employed people in every area, like, you know.  When I was in the Philippines, I ran a section there that hired Philippine women.  I had a supply station that was all of people working everywhere, Filipinos, and their women.  Somewhere around here I have a book when I was discharged where all these Philippine women put their picture in, wrote nice goodbyes (signed letters and things), very popular.  But no, that is the kind of work.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: So I didn't have to fight.  I've never killed anybody.
Speaker 1: Did you have any thoughts about the--the Army was desegregated in 1949, I think the order was issued in '49 [1949].  Did you think it was going to come that soon? (unclear).
Speaker 2: I had no thoughts about it.  I really didn't--I was out in '46 [1946], finished my duty, back in school.
Speaker 1: So then that kind of segregation was something that you took for granted.
Speaker 2: You took it for--I took it for granted.  That was it.  That's what the Army was to me.
Story_ID: 27055
Speaker 1: So when you got out [of the Army] in '46 [1946], you came back to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  You see Howard--Washington, D.C. was a segregated city too.  If you went downtown and left the campus and went downtown, it be very difficult for you to find a drink of water in Washington, couldn't go to movies in Washington.  I went to--I tell the story, been told a number of places when I've been interviewed.  I went downtown to go to a movie, two of us.  That's before I knew I couldn't go.  And one fellow was African, from Ghana somewhere.  The two of us went down, got to the movie.  They told me, you know, couldn't go.  But he had a passport in hand, he's African, he could go.  So--
Speaker 1: So, this policy.  It's something particularly focused on the racism on black Americans--
Speaker 2: Black Americans.
Speaker 1: --In America--
Speaker 2: It's black Americans.
Speaker 1: --Which is different from what they--it's not even a color.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a color.  If black African, you go.  But he wouldn't go because the two of us went together.  We turned around again and went back, (went home?).
Speaker 1: I heard another story about a Howard student had wrapped his head up and went as an Indian to the movies so they would go because they thought he was Indian.  So it wasn't what he looked like.
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't black American, that's all. Black Americans couldn't go.
Speaker 1: Interesting time period.
Story_ID: 27056
Speaker 1: So, back at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] now, who are some of the personalities there and who inspired you at all, and--?
Speaker 2: All the professors.  All those I named were very supportive.  And, and they were good--Howard graduated some very good engineers.  Whether you're the best or whether you're good, they--coming out of Howard had some very--
Speaker 1: So did you get good grades, I take it?
Speaker 2: --Yeah, I had good grades.  I had a lot of-I had good friends and classmates.  As I said, I showed you-- I joined the chess team and I was a good chess player at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't go in for any, any sports.  That was my, my college activity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Extracurricular activity.
Speaker 1: So, did you win any awards playing chess?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't win any awards.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: I was captain of the chess team.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did you-- so you focused on engineering, on electrical engineering?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any particular focus that you had in electrical engineering?
Speaker 2: Well, I would have been in power, you know, in engineering, I know.  I did a volunteer project in Washington [D.C.].  I went down to the government--one of the government agencies there, the one that deals with power lines and designed a power line for the Midwest as a volunteer project.  And so I was--my focus was power.  But when I got out of--when I finished Howard and started looking for a job I couldn't find a job as an electrical engineer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I take it the D.C. power company, whatever it's called, wasn't integrated?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether it was or not, I couldn't find a job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I found a job as a technician.  And that's when I worked for the Naval Research Library.  So I got a government job as a technician.  And I had been in the job only a few months when an engineer, who was in charge of one of the sections, was looking at my work what I was doing and he looked at my background, he said, "You, you shouldn't be a technician." And immediately I was promoted.
Story_ID: 27057
Speaker 1: This fellow said, "You should be an engineer." And within a week I was promoted and put in charge of the project.  That was Naval Research Laboratory [Washington, D.C.].  I never forget this man of course, his name is John Shipman [sp] from Texas.  He finished with the University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas].  So we worked on projects together and we worked in development of high current photomultipliers and photodiodes and I ended up receiving a patent.  So I have a patent.
Speaker 2: So your first patent in 19--, was it--
Speaker 1: That was '49 [1949].
Speaker 2: Forty-nine [1949]?  Let me go back a minute because we skipped something we shouldn't have skipped.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: And that's, you met your wife, Marguerite?
Speaker 1: Oh, I met my wife my freshman year [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  When I first got to Washington, D.C., I got there before school started, of course, that summer.  Got my application in, got admitted and I got a job at the Government-- Government Printing Agency, that was the name of the organization.  It's an agency where they do all the printing of documents for the government, the Government Printing Agency, in the cafeteria bussing dishes. In that cafeteria all the black males bus dishes, and she was a waitress there.  She had just finished Dunbar High School.  And she was, she had been accepted into college at Virginia State.  So there we were, two, about to go to college.  I met her then.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, did she go on to Virginia State [University, Ettrick, Virginia]?
Speaker 1: Yes, she went to Virginia State.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was in '42 [1942] so she went to Virginia State and graduated in '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we kept in touch.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So was she back in D.C. when you came out of the Navy?
Speaker 1: Yes, when I came out of the Army, she was back--
Speaker 2: Out of the Army, rather, the Army.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, when I came out of the Army, we met.  But she graduated the year I came out of the Army, she graduated, so we dated for a year and we married in '47 [1947].  So two of my college years we were married.  She was working and I had a GI Bill so there we were in Washington [D.C.].  I'm at Howard and she had a little job working with the Girl Scouts, I guess.   And I graduated in '49 [1949].
Story_ID: 27058
Speaker 1: You started at the U.S. Naval Research Lab [Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C.] in '49 [1949]?
Speaker 2: Naval Research Lab. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's 1949.  Alright.
Speaker 2: So I worked about six months, I guess (unclear).
Speaker 1: You had your first patent?  What did you patent?
Speaker 2: Photodiode.
Speaker 1: Explain what this is, photodiode is?
Speaker 2: Well, an electric tube, and diode has two elements, cathode and anode. And photodiode, if light hits it, it converts light to electric current.  I'd have to explain a little bit about what testing of nuclear device is required.
Speaker 1: Now, let's not get there until--
Speaker 2: No, but that's-- you asked about a photodiode.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well that has something to do with--
Speaker 2: Yes.  At the Naval Research Laboratory the assignment that I was given as, when I became head of that project was to design detectors, nuclear detectors and the way you what you were detecting were gamma rays what's emitted during the reaction of a nuclear device, gamma, release of gamma rays.  And the way to see gamma rays, you let the rays penetrate a liquid as a liquid is toluene, toluene to a funnel and when the gamma ray goes through that solution, it gives off light.  And then if you take a photomultiplier, a photodiode and you're looking in on that liquid, that light will be converted to a current and if it's happening in a very short time like nanoseconds of time you get a pulse, it's quick light, nanoseconds long.  And that's converted to current and you measure-- you record that on some recording instrument, oscilloscope for instance.  Now that's how you test devices.  So Naval Research Lab was to furnish these detectors and I had-we had-- we developed them, built them and this was super-secret.  I had Q clearance at that time.
Story_ID: 27059
Speaker 1: So what you patented was not only just a photodiode but a process?
Speaker 2: Most of these units give only various little current.  It exists.  A flash of light that's lasting for so many nanoseconds, how much light is that, you know, you can see it.  The photodiode can see it, but it's such a small amount of light that the signal that's generated is very small and if you were going to record that, you have to have very sensitive recording material, even if you got an oscilloscope on the end.  But when you got ready to test these devices you were miles away.  So that little signal that's going back through coaxial cable all the way back can be wiped out.  So you needed, you needed something that was going to give you big currents.  So this was, so this photodiode that I patent was called high current photodiode.  That means it was one that would deliver--  you could look at very bright lights and get a signal and see the coaxial cable, the fifty ohm type cable just one foot had so much attenuation, two feet, and here you are miles back, because your equipment got to be away from the blast.  So we had device sitting here monitoring equipment right there with miles of coaxial cable going back to a recording station and this is not an easy thing to do, to get those signals and it's those signals that gave you the reaction history of the device.  This is what the physicists who were designing them, they come up with certain design and configuration and said they think this will work.  What we did in the testing and system division was to take the first design, take it into the field, fire it and look at actually what happens.  Look at what the reaction that takes place during that explosion, and we can then feed that information back to the physicists and they said, "Oh, now we know we should do this and make corrections."  That's one advantage that the United States had on in this whole development program, we did--we got a lot of information from testing and though you had to have detectors and recording equipment, and that's how I got involved with the Naval Research Lab, I worked with developing the detector.  And the ones I designed we used for one of the detonations.  I was--
Speaker 1: Now, did you have to go to California to do that?
Speaker 2: I had-- I built them at Naval Research in Washington, D.C. and now they want them, got them and say we're going to ship them to California.  Well, they were hand-carried.  I mean when I say hand carried, these were too big to carry all these detectors but I was the person.  This was my project, these were the ones that were accepted to be used and kept in a test.  So I was to deliver those from Washington, D.C. to California and they hired the Flying Tigers Airline, me and these detectors.  And this was so secret at the time that the Flying Tiger pilots couldn't know what they had and where they were going.  I changed pilots three times between Washington, D.C. and California.  That was my first big job there.  After that I went to work directly for the University of California [at Berkley, Berkley, California].
Story_ID: 27060
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is Lawrence Livermore [National Laboratory, Livermore, California]?
Speaker 2: What it is, is the University of California Lawrence Radiation Laboratory [University of California at Berkeley Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Berkley, California].
Speaker 1: Lawrence Radiation Laboratory.
Speaker 2: So shortly you heard it as LRL, Lawrence Radiation Lab.  You had two, two laboratories that were doing this work.  One is called Los Alamos [National Laboratory], the other is LRL.  Both are the University of California.  During that time nobody really knew all of that.
Speaker 1: But Los Alamos is a different site?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's in Los Alamos, New Mexico and Livermore.  And these labs are really competing.
Speaker 1: On the same project, basically?
Speaker 2: Well, before you get a project.  You know, an atomic, if you're going to develop a weapon, weapons are designed to destroy, so you can build something that's going to have a given explosion that will wipe out, let's say, a whole town, but it might be big as this house.  You're not going to wipe out anybody because you can't deliver it.  And if you notice in this article that came out in the paper just last week or two weeks ago about North Korea and-
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: --they were saying what they had done-- what they were learning.  It's no problem learning how to build an atomic bomb, that's nothing, you could build it with a couple days' teaching, but what you come up with would be something you couldn't deliver.  You either got to have something that you could drop out of an airplane, or you got to have something that you can shoot out of a submarine or off a battleship.  And there, the barrels are so big around.  So if you're going to use a weapon, you're saying, "I can put it on a cannon, submarine, and I can shoot it, and if I shoot it out of what we have on our battleships or our submarines, it will go so many miles.  But my barrel is only this big around, so you've got to give me something that will go through that barrel and when it takes that arc and hits over here, I want it to destroy this much area." So that's the key, how small can you get it, small enough to deliver and still, when it gets there, have enough power to destroy.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were working on your project the rocket scientists were trying to figure out ways to deliver them?
Speaker 2: Well, you're building-- things are built for the military.  So the military says, "I'm-- we're going to build a submarine and our submarine got barrels and they're so big in diameter.  So we would like to have a missile that if we can deliver something from the submarine that will go so many miles, but when it gets there we want it to cover let's say a fifty mile diameter area."
Speaker 1: So now-
Speaker 2: Now, I'm getting to this because now you got Los Alamos and Livermore and both research teams, although they aren't building a bomb, they're going to come-- they're going to sit down for a certain period of time, these two different teams, and they're going to come back to the military in a sense bid against each other on how to do it, and these are big, you know, you're talking about a lot of money and a big dime and so one of those laboratories will be assigned, depending on their presentation, for that particular job, and that's why you have the two.  They both were University of California.
Story_ID: 27061
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just want to ask you, like prior to your work at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, what kind of prior know--did you have any knowledge at all of hydrogen bombs--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Or nuclear devices?
Speaker 2: No.  I knew that's how I got out of the Army, I knew that they dropped the bomb on Hiroshima [Japan] and the war was ended and that got me out, but that's all I knew about it.  And I'm an electrical engineer and I had no--that wasn't what I--it just so happened I got that job at the Naval Research Lab [Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C.] and I built those detectors and they were for development of thermonuclear units and my whole career changed.  I never took a job in electrical engineering.  This was electronic scientist and it wasn't until I--the last twenty years of my life that I got back to power engineering when I started working for United Illuminating Company, I got back into engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you went out to California, you were still working for Naval Research, right?
Speaker 2: No, I ch-- after I finished those detectors, I knew that they were for that program and so I made it known that I would like to work in that program and the Navy was going to stop doing that work because the University of California was going to be doing it all.  So I just put the application in, and that was almost a winner right from the beginning.  They wanted me.
Speaker 1: So you've become an employee of the Lawrence Research Laboratories?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And my job was to continue designing instrumentation and I got into the--one of the instruments I used in the firing and then I had a system to record and I had the privilege of doing research on a system and I designed what is called a digital diagnostic system, and this was to do it in a digital way rather than the, rather than the oscilloscopes.  So back--
Speaker 1: So you designed the digital--
Speaker 2: --Diagnostic system.
Speaker 1: --Diagnostic system.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then I presented papers, quite a few papers all over different places.
Speaker 1: About what time was it when you designed the digital diagnostic?
Speaker 2: That was in the early '70s [1970s].  Now this is the first digital system.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is in the '70s [1970s], okay.
Speaker 2: Early--nobody was--there weren't any Ipads and--so my digital system was--take up this whole wall.  I can show you a picture of a digital system, the way now, you talk about a little Iphone, but my digital system covered that whole wall back there.
Speaker 1: When you used that you have to use a computer that big.
Speaker 2: Those are all of the different things that you look at--you're still looking at that little bit of light that comes from that gamma ray going through this material and scintillating.  When it passes through toluene it scintillates, gives off light and you measure that light, that's what you're doing.
Story_ID: 27062
Speaker 1: But I still need to go back to where you were around 1950 or so.  Now is it correct, on my outline it says that you were on the firing team, I guess, when you were describing yourself and another person on the firing team?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was another system.  That wasn't the measurement system, that's the system and I don't know I haven't checked with anything to, I don't know what is completely declassified.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It says here that you were on a firing team and it was one of the last (unclear) in the production of the process?
Speaker 2: As I said, large devices when you have hundreds of megatons.  In order to test that device it's too big to test at the Nevada-- Nevada test site.  So you go out into the Pacific and you go to the--we went to Bikini and yeah, little island Atoll.
Speaker 1: That's in the South Pacific?
Speaker 2: South Pacific.  So you set up your device on a barge out in the water and you have your control system on the little island and you detonate it out there and it blows up and you measure--make your measurements.
Speaker 1: How close were you to that detonation?
Speaker 2: Oh, for that one, I guess, could be, I don't know, twenty miles, no more than that for the big one.  For the big one-- we're almost twenty miles in Nevada.  So I don't know what the distance was, but you were far enough away that you're not going to be in the blast.  This is on, when a nuclear device goes, and you see that big mushroom cloud, that cloud and that heat from that goes long, long ways, you have to be a long ways--
Speaker 1: Where you were when the--
Speaker 2: --Where we were, where we had the control system, it was far enough away to be protected from the blast, but the concern was what kind of shock wave would cause a tidal wash out of the island.  So for the large shot that I was working on, we had people to calculate what the tidal wave was going to be.
Speaker 1: Did they calculate it correctly?  Was it correctly calculated?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm here.  So they evacuated the whole island, except for five.  So there were five of us who stayed on that island and it took bulldozers and built berms all around the island so in a sense, in a bowl, we're down in a bowl.  And the five people, one was a general, General (Casada?), that one, one was a chef, he had everything set to cook and the three of us fired the missile.  And I was one of the three.
Speaker 1: So, general, chef and three scientists.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we went boom.  Everything went fine and here-- I'm here now talking about it.
Story_ID: 27063
Speaker 1: I have a note here too, that said that you were responsible for the arming of the hydrogen bomb, is this true?
Speaker 2: Well, that's one of the--I don't like to use words like "responsible for," because there was team, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm one of the--I had a function.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a function and wasn't going to--what I did was needed as much as anybody else, but as a team, you know, and all these efforts were, were teams.
Speaker 1: So we can say that you were on the--that you worked on the team that was responsible for arming the H-bomb [hydrogen bomb]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  So I'm very careful that I don't try to say that I'm, you know, I'm the man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All I can remember at some of the countdowns I've had people yell, by the time you get them you start saying, "Ten, nine--," and somebody yell out, "McCraven, are you sure you got that right?" boom. (laugh).
Speaker 1: This is in '54 [1954]?  Is this in '54 [1954] or earlier?
Speaker 2: No, this is in the '70s [1970s], yeah, in the '50s [1950s], I'm sorry, yeah, I left in '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says that on March 1, 1954, there were twenty-three tests performed but the one on March 1, '54 [1954] was the first test of a practical hydrogen bomb, the largest nuclear explosion (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Where did that information come from?  I don't remember giving that, making that statement.
Speaker 1: No, it's not a quote from you.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: But it's something they found on the internet.  They said that it was codename Castle Bravo, was the first test.  So probably all that stuff has leaked out by now, but--
Speaker 2: I'm sure a lot of it has been declassified, but since there were two laboratories, Los Alamos [National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico] and Livermore [National Laboratory, Livermore, California], it doesn't mean that every time--
Speaker 1: --One did one thing and one the other didn't necessarily--
Speaker 2: --No, we all did the same thing but we had different names, like each one of those tests had a name and I only worked on the ones that were other Livermore.  Los Alamos had the same kinds of teams that Livermore had.  So there tests done in Nevada that were done by Los Alamos and there were tests done by Livermore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Same thing on Bikini [Atoll].  Whoever had that contract, their people did the work.  So you'd have to look at the certificates that I have to see the names of the ones that I worked on. So-
Speaker 1: Okay. We're not sure--
Speaker 2: That one, yeah, that one, I don't remember that name.
Story_ID: 27064
Speaker 1: In the '50s [1950s], I guess, in the mid-50s [1950s] there were devices detonated by the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, France, and by the early '60s [1960s], Republic-- People's Republic of China detonated one in '64 [1964].  So all of these countries have become part of the, I guess, the nuclear family, hydrogen bomb family. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: How did you-- at the time you were working on these did you think, I mean, what were your thoughts, because a lot of people were really fearful that the whole world was going to be blown to smithereens?
Speaker 1: I know I wasn't afraid of the world being blown up.  I didn't think of that.  I knew it was a deadly weapon, I knew that I--one thing that you always thought of that, okay, if this is what it takes to save the country.  This is the weapon this country has to have, you hope that it will never have to be used again, that, just by having it, it will be a standoff.  And one thing I will tell you about and I don't know-- is that these tests, when I first went there, the tests were done above ground.  So some of them you put on balloons and the balloon took it up into the air and you'd detonate it.  Some you had towers built, you'd put on top of a tower and that, and once that-- when it goes off, it sucks up the desert sand and dirt and that's where you get this big mushroom cloud.  The big ones in Bikini Atoll, they put on a barge and float it out into the middle of the water somewhere and you go boom, and that's the difference.  And the timing is also important.  Every test in Nevada is done just before sun up, because so much depends on that little light that you're trying to record.  And also, there are a lot of other information, a lot of other tests being performed.  One, airplanes are flying through that mushroom cloud, airplanes did not want to fly in the dark on a test.
Speaker 2: So are-- were these manned airplanes flying through?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Oh, yeah.  We had--so you fired just before daybreak.  So we got our measurements, it's dark, and when the air people from planes started getting measurements, it's daylight.  Just at the crack of dawn, you go boom, mushroom clouds up and all of a sudden the sun is there.  So you satisfy both requirements, darkness and light.
Story_ID: 27065
Speaker 1: But you're not just developing, doing that research, you're doing all kinds of--fallout, that dust is going to fallout, that big mushroom cloud, it's going to come down on the ground someplace, alright.  Okay, it's going to come down at night, come down on people, but it's going to be spread such that so far and such little, it's going to be safe, you're not going to get so much radiation, but we do need to know if you get fallout on you, how it's going to affect you.  So you have people, soldiers, we had people in the Army coming in and they set up things all around and they make tests on shockwave fallout, and so when you get to a point where you think it's going to harm people, we use pigs.  We had a pig farm, had all these pigs, all the pigs were white.  And a pig skin is just like a human skin and if you get the hair off it, it's just like human.  So I used to always say, "Oh no, we're going to know how it happened, how it affects white people, we're not going to know how it affects black people, you know."
Speaker 2: They didn't have any black skin pigs there?
Speaker 1: Because with blacks, it will harm more and bomb discriminates.
Speaker 2: Really, I mean how--why so you would think that--
Speaker 1: Black absorbs radiation.
Speaker 2: --I mean the melanin in your skin would absorb--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the radiation?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  A black bird flying through the air might just fallout and hit the ground and forget concentration of radiation.
Speaker 2: Dark colors absorb the radiation.
Speaker 1: Black is--like the sun affects you differently.
Speaker 2: Well, usually, the melanin protects, at least, if I had more of it--
Speaker 1: You absorb more radiation.  You absorb it differently and so if you were in a field where the fallout from a nuclear device, you're going to be affected more than your white brother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But anyway, we had pig farms and we'd take these pigs and put them out in locations so the fallout will get on to them and the scientists take those pigs back and do all kinds of research on the pigs.  So there are any number of experiments going on, any university that dreams up something that they think that should be studied and they put in an application and if it's good, they can come out and put an experiment in during, during the time that you're detonating.  So other than just developing this weapon, you're getting all this information.  So there's a lot of activity going on.
Speaker 2: My note here says that you designed this digital measuring system in the '61 [1961], not '70 [1970]?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I wasn't there in '70 [1970], '70 [1970] I was back here.  I left in '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Yeah, you said '70 [1970], but you just misstated  it?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I left--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 27066
Speaker 1: Okay, so '61 [1961] and, and let's see, this is--and then in--was it near the same time that you got involved in some of the peaceful uses of--
Speaker 2: That was the last, the very--oh, no.  Let me put it this way, the last shot that I was involved with was [Operation] Plowshare--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the University of California [at Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  And that Plowshare--and the reason and you know, you think about it, you know why it's named Plowshare, because you hammer your swords in the plowshare [paraphrased from Isaiah 2:3-5]--
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --peace.  And that--so that's why that operation--and that was done in Carlsbad, New Mexico, underground, in the salt you go down in--so what happened there, the heat could seal off and melt that--it's a salt-type base in Mexico and so you contain all the heat within this one cavity and use that heat to generate power, that's one experiment.  And so anybody who felt they had an idea of what the energy that's released, how that energy could be used in a peaceful way, they could perform--experiment there, and that is called Operation Plowshare.
Speaker 1: So what were some of the--did anybody discover a way to really use it for?
Speaker 2: Well, I say one way, well, you want to do--you want to (unclear)-- you could think about how to create cavities, you know, a shot, to be able to open up a cavity, you could shape a ravine, but--
Speaker 1: So you could shape under subterranean--
Speaker 2: --Well, no.  You would want to do it.  If you wanted to create, create an opening anywhere, you could shape a device that could open up the land.  There are medical research done with this energy.  There were-- I-- well, I think in terms of taking that energy to create electricity.  Because if you get, you know, if you got a pot of boiling--a lot of heat that you have contained, that's energy that you can use for a lot of things, and it's--since the explosion would cause a cavity that would seal itself off, you had an underground cavity that was, talking about hot, it's hot, I don't know.
Speaker 1: --Super-heated.
Speaker 2: Super-heated.  To give maybe some idea of a small device that's fired in Nevada, we're twenty miles away, and when that device explodes, you can read a 'New York Times' in the dark.  If you were--as I said if you fired it in the dark, and when it went off, you're sitting twenty miles away, it's daylight, that's what you're talking about.
Speaker 1: How long does that last, that effect last?
Speaker 2: Not too long.  And I said the daylight came anyway.  But it's, it's huge.  And we're about forty miles, sixty miles, I guess, from Las Vegas [Nevada].  So you had to know--we had instruments that were microbarograph instruments, would tell which way the shock wave was going to go and that depends on what the climatic conditions are at the time.  We had to cancel a lot of shots like you were going--it's scheduled for one day at a certain time and first thing you do just close to that time, you make a--have a microbarograph shot and measure their shock wave and you find out it's going in this direction.  The next day is--so if the atmospheric conditions are such that the shock wave is going to go toward Las Vegas, we'd have to cancel, because the shock wave would knock every window in the casino out at sixty miles away, so we couldn't fire it when the shock waves are going to head toward Las Vegas.  And then carrying out these experiments there are things you had to do for protection.

Speaker 1: I see in here, a note in here about Phelps Dodge [Corporation].  Did you work for Phelps Dodge at some point?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The reason I came to, and that's going to Connecticut, Phelps Dodge, I will stray a little bit so you will have an understanding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I said that you make this measurement and you had to send it back on coaxial cable.  Well, you lose a lot depending on the impedance of that cable.  So you have an outer conductor and an inner conductor on your cable and that's how your--
Speaker 1: Cable TV works--
Speaker 2: Cable TV works.
Speaker 1: --coaxial cable.
Speaker 2: Coaxial cable.  But what, what holds that center conductor in place is what determines what the impedance of that cable is going to be.  So, so you can have a solid material in there and the center one is held directly in the middle, it got to be in the middle, all the way, well, most solids have high impedance.  What you'd like to have is a lossless cable, a cable that won't lose.  If you put in a volt out here, you got a volt out on the other end, you'd like to have air so nothing would be holding--you have nothing to hold that center conductor in place.  Well, the Germans designed a cable that's called air dielectric cable.  They had some material and they're holding that center conductor in place, but it was only in certain places.  So most of the inner side--inside was air and this was the best cable in the world.  Phelps Dodge happened to know about that.  And they got the right to handle that cable, because Phelps Dodge makes cable, coaxial cable, and that cable is made in Yonkers, New York.  So they got the rights to the German cable, and it's my understanding at that time, that during the test period every foot of cable that they could make, they could sell to no one else but the Atomic Energy Commission.  So they had a market.  We bought all the cable that they could make.  They were making money.  And the cable is in all kinds of sizes.  So you run that cable for miles, you have a--you blow up the device and you blow up the cable.
Speaker 1: So you need some more?
Speaker 2: Hurry up Phelps, make some more so we--make some more.  Well, I got, and you can see now, since I'm in the system, I got to know Phelps Dodge people quite well.
Story_ID: 27068
Speaker 1: And what Phelps Dodge decided, as a company, that if they were going to be peaceful uses of nuclear energy, they want to be in on the beginning of it.  So they decided to form a company that's called Phelps Dodge Communications.  And that was--that company was going to be headquartered in North Haven, Connecticut, which is from this house, maybe twenty miles.  And Phelps Dodge had to have a staff for this company.  And they hired five people from Livermore [National Laboratory, Livermore, California] to come out here and set up that company, I was one of the five.  So Phelps Dodge Communication was a company established for peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  And they did this, unlike any other project they would undertake, they had no study, no feasibility study at all.  But they wanted to get it right off the ground.  And they did their feasibility study after they had set up the company and hired five of us.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what year is this that you go to--
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 2: --Nineteen sixty-four [1964], okay.
Speaker 1: So we got here and they did their feasibility.  They hired a fellow from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] to do the feasibility study.  His report said, "It's not going to work.  Take your losses and get out." So now--
Speaker 2: You were already here?
Speaker 1: We're here, five of us.  But of course, this consultant from Yale, when he wrote that, he ended up in his report, I found out, by no chance-- "By no way lose McCraven."  So four people lost their job, and the University of California [at Berkeley, Berkeley, California] hired them back, but I stayed and I worked for Phelps Dodge for five years because we made other cable systems.  It wasn't--I made--they still made their cable and we were responsible for all the cable made in Yonkers of all kinds and I was chief engineer.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So basically, making coaxial cable?
Speaker 1: Making coaxial cable.  Well assembly.  You take the cable, the cable is made in a plant in Yonkers, and we'd take it and put it into configurations and do things with it, make systems out of it, different kinds of delayed lines and the connectors were made here for that cable.  So I didn't go looking for another job at that time, but someone--the power company [United Illumination Company] came to me and asked me to come join them, and I decided, that Phelps Dodge was going to end up--I'd end up in New York somewhere.
Speaker 2: So this is, what year did the power company come looking for you, is this 1970?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.  That's when I went to UI [United Illuminating Company], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, that was right.  Okay, we got that one right.  Okay, so you were basically with Phelps Dodge [Corporation] for six years?
Speaker 1: Five, something like that.
Speaker 2: Five, okay, okay.  So in those years did Phelps Dodge improve upon the German cable?
Speaker 1: No.  They made their own.  See coaxial cable comes in all kinds.  They already had a plant making other cable.  But these were solid die electric cable, if you got a signal big enough, you don't worry about the loss.  You worry about it but you don't want a loss of cable because the more loss you have, the more you got to amplify things and do things in order to see it, so your air dielectric has the least loss.  You put a little signal in and you run the cable so many miles your signal will be down to, let's say you put a volt in and you get attenuation five times--ten times you got a tenth of that signal down at the other end and so you put in an amplifier on the pole, you'd have to boost the signal to keep it big enough to use.  So Phelps Dodge has always made--they make all kinds of cable and--
Speaker 2: It's an air dielectric kind?
Speaker 1: --that was good for the nuclear test.  We needed that airline.  And when you--the thing about it is when you take a signal and attenuate it that much, you change the shape of it, so you distort your signal.  So air dielectric won't let you see the true signal.
Story_ID: 27069
Speaker 1: Now, during this, during this period of time, I guess, now are you going to graduate school at all?
Speaker 2: Well, I took courses.  I took, I took courses at the University of Maryland, I took a course--one course I took, the name of the course was 'How to Build a Time Bomb.'
Speaker 1: Really.  Is this in a government facility?
Speaker 2: No, the university.  Well, it's in the government--cable is-- a class that was taught in the government facility.  You had to be, I had Q cards.
Speaker 1: You had to have a clearance right? I would think so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had Q clearance.
Speaker 1: Now I was kind of frightened in the '80s [1980s] when I heard that any good electrical engineer or you know or science-- science student can go to the library and figure out how to do it.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yeah.  But can you build one a size that you can do something with?  Now if you build one that's big as this house, and I do the same thing in a basketball size, they're different.  I can put mine and take mine and use it a lot of places.  You can't move yours.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So that's-
Speaker 1: That's the difference.  To make it portable enough would be the [simultaneously]--
Speaker 2: Mine's got to be--my basketball is just as powerful as your house, that's the thing.
Speaker 1: --That's the real scary thing.
Speaker 2: That's-- and that's what this last week's report about North Korea.  North Korea said they had one--they showed two things, they showed a missile, they fired a missile, then they said they had a nuclear missile.  They are saying they have--what they are saying is, "I have a missile, but I have a bomb that's small enough to fit into that missile and I fire this missile, it goes"-- everybody, the world looking at it, look how far that missile could go.  Now if I said, "I'm also working on a bomb and it will go inside that missile," now you're saying, you're telling the world, "I can reach you with an atomic--."  That's the message that you're looking at.  When someone said they have a missile that goes so many miles, what can that missile carry?  And you got another group out here saying, "I'm going to build something small enough that will wipe you out and put inside that missile."  That's the scary part of the whole thing.  Now that's what it's all about.  If you know any-- we are way over here, but all these countries over there are so close together, those missiles go they can reach, for instance, Iran can fire a missile that can reach Israel. But can-- Iran doesn't have a missile that they can fire and reach the United States.  So then they get-- so they get a base someplace.  If they get Cuba, now they can go there and say, "We got a missile that can reach the United States."  That's what all, this whole thing is about, whose threatening and whose not threatening?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nobody, but the one thing, all these countries know is that if you-- we can't have it we can't do it because it's suicidal.
Speaker 1: There's no winner.
Speaker 2: There's no winner when you start dealing with this.  But they all know-- so when, when we say we're watching Iran, and Iran, "Why is it you-- why is it Israel can have one and you don't want Iran?" Well, Iran, you don't think can keep it out of the hands of the wrong people.  Where if you're talking to England and you're talking to the United States, they say, "Well, okay, we agree that we aren't going to use this, but we're going to keep it, just in case we have to, but we aren't going to be--our goal is to never use it."  But now, the third country out there, you don't trust them.
Speaker 1: It's a fact that trust based on culture, I guess, relations, you know?
Speaker 2: You said, if you don't trust the country, you say, we don't want them to have it, and that's what is it's all about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now the other thing I did.  You can put it wherever--and stop and then you can go back to where you want, but we had, in making these instruments, developing these instruments, we did go into an agreement with Aldermaston and Aldermaston is the atomic energy department in England [United Kingdom].  And I went to Aldermaston and spent time at Aldermaston to work with the instrument that we were going to buy for them--from them.  Marguerite went with me and we had a nice--we made a nice vacation out of it while I--we had a nice place to stay and I commuted to the laboratory every day.  That's another little thing I did on the side there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how long did you spend in England?
Speaker 2: Under two weeks, short time, but to evaluate their instrumentation that we--that they were going to send to this country.
Story_ID: 27070
Speaker 1: Nineteen Seventy [1970], United Illuminating Company.  Now, this is the power company for this part of Connecticut?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right now these lights are provided by United Illuminating Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they approached you when you were working with--
Speaker 2: Phelps Dodge.
Speaker 1: --Phelps Dodge, okay.  So, so what did you do at United Illuminating?
Speaker 2: Vice president of environmental engineering.  I was instrumental in running their environmental programming which meant what kind of license they could get, and I would represent them at any hearing for licensing in the programs that they used to stay within the environmental laws, I was instrumental.  You know I have an article there by the president of the United Illuminating Company that I'll give it to you to take, because it's, it's the best statement that anyone could want coming from--
Speaker 1: The boss.
Speaker 2: --the president about what my contributions were to the company.  And he, in a nice long speech, he says, he gives things that he didn't feel that they would have accomplished, would have accomplished without me.  I was well--with the programs that I had them put in place, I was very well thought of by the State Department of Environmental Protection.  And, as I said, I was charter member of the advisory committee for establishing the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency]. And--
Speaker 1: Here in Connecticut?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: National?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  U.S. EPA, national.
Speaker 1: So, when was that?  Was that before you came to--
Speaker 2: No this was after I went to UI.  The EPA was--I can't remember what year the EPA really was made an agency, but that--
Speaker 1: It seems like it was established during the [President Jimmy] Carter administration.  Was that Carter?
Speaker 2: --I think it was Carter. I don't know, I can't remember who was president.  I know who the first-- Russell Train was the--I think Russell Train was the first director.
Speaker 1: Well, Carter would have been president from '76 [1976] to '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Who was before Carter then?
Speaker 1: Before Carter was Gerald Ford and then [Richard] Nixon before Ford.
Speaker 2: EPA got started before '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Well, maybe it was [unclear]--
Speaker 2: Again, I don't know.  This was the beginning of EPA.
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: I was on the advisory committee to establish EPA.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking it was a democrat that started it, I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Well, whatever, I have some of that information here.  I was a charter member of the executive committee for establishing EPA.  And I, and I wrote that down in that as one of the things that I did.
Story_ID: 27071
Speaker 1: So UI [United Illuminating Company] was able to license a coal burning power plant during the time I was with them, and that's what the president was saying, he said they would never have gotten the license to burn coal if I hadn't been the person working with them.
Speaker 2: What did you have to do to ensure that they got a license?
Speaker 1: Well, I made sure that their emissions--I came up with the pro--the one thing in Connecticut was it was the sulfur emissions of the coal, and I was able to make it--came up with a program that made it very easy to burn low sulfur coal, that is to get it and get it approved.  And normally you do things to--you put on equipment to capture something or you do something to clean the coal, but there is a coal--a coal mine in West Virginia that was low sulfur coal and came up with a plan where the coal was tested at the coal mine rather than back here in Connecticut.  So, they would mine the coal, put it on these cars and test it and if it didn't pass, it went on the sideline and it never came to Connecticut.  In Bridgeport we had a power plant burning coal and emission was under 1 percent, just about 1 percent all the time, and that made it feasible.  This whole program made it very feasible to operate that plant.  You can imagine in getting the permit there was a lot of opposition within the state from people saying, "No, don't burn no coal in Connecticut."  And I got them to burn coal.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were able to demonstrate that it had low sulfur?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And that it was controlled.  See, the thing is, that you can say you're going to do something but how do we know it's going to happen?  So, I was able to come up with a program that demonstrated to the regulators that it would be under control, and it was.  It was a nice program.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And, so then there's a national organization for all power companies, and I chaired that organization, it's called Edison Electric Institute.  And Edison Electric Institute is the national organization for all privately-owned power companies, including yours in Illinois.  The Illinois power company.
Speaker 2: Commonwealth Edison?
Speaker 1: Commonwealth Edison, they had--in this organization, Commonwealth Edison had a place in reporting to me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I represented the executive level of organization-- the national organization, which was quite an honor for UI.  I had a very nice twenty years.  I retired from UI in 1989, and I had twenty years with them.
Story_ID: 27072
Speaker 1: Now, when you were at UI [United Illuminating Company], there's some information in here on the outline about you acting as a mediator for some racial tension up in New Haven [Connecticut], is that true?
Speaker 2: Oh, that--we had a riot here, and we certainly, I didn't do too much mediating.  I don't know where that came from.  We did our part.  For one thing, like Marguerite's a social worker.  She had a number of inner city New Haven [Connecticut] children during that riot to come here to spend the day and they would be out in the yard.  So they spent--while there's rioting down there, she had children here and fed them and taught them.  So you know we worked with that group.  And I've been very active with organizations at UI.  I'm a fellow at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], associate fellow, and I was president of the Yale Peabody Museum.  All that I put on that sheet that I submitted to--I mailed a form--those forms that I sent out--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --I listed all those things.  So, I was, I was president of American Red Cross for Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island, the regional president.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite, I guess--
Speaker 2: Organization?
Speaker 1: --Yeah, organization that you served?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether I had a favorite organization.  I find it--it's kind of difficult to say no when somebody asks me to do something.  I served on so many organizations and once I get on it, I try to do the best and next thing I end up chairman or the president or something, so I ended up being president of Red Cross.  We went to China.
Speaker 1: When did you go to China?
Speaker 2: I have to ask my wife.
Speaker 1: [President Richard] Nixon went in '72 [1972].  Did you go in the '70s [1970s] or '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Had to be seven, no, I guess it was the '80s [1980s], '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the '80s [1980s].  It was in the '80s [1980s].  And guessing for one week we were guests of the Chinese government.  Marguerite went and we had--we stayed for about a month.  They put us up in a nice hotel, gave us tours all over China.  We travelled by boat, by plane, by train to different sections of China, had a guard, I guess, a guide, I guess, he was also a guard.  But it was very nice.  We went out on the farms, you know, where the Chinese couldn't have but one child, but if you farmed, you could have another one, if you're a farmer on the farms.  And they--Chinese thought that anybody that was Red Cross was a medical doctor.  So when we got there, they thought all of us were medical doctors.  And we had twenty people to go, all Red Cross people.  So they thought they had twenty doctors, medical doctors.  So I did that, and I chaired that organization.
Story_ID: 27073
Speaker 1: Peabody Museum [Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] is where all the dinosaurs, too bad you don't have long enough to see that, because that's one of the big things here in New Haven is that Peabody Museum.  And there was a member [Rudolph Zallinger] of the Peabody Museum, a Yale person, who was an artist, and when you go in, all over the walls are these huge life-size drawings of dinosaurs and then if you go down to Yale, like most of these old Ivy League schools, they have big pictures of the presidents, well, this one artist did most of those paintings, a lot of them anyway.  He didn't do them all, because he didn't live long enough, but he did--a period of time he did all the dinosaurs as a student, I guess, and painted all those presidents, and they're all white males, Ivy League presidents.  And so, I guess, when I was president, we got to know each other quite well.  I said, "Why don't you paint another picture?"  So he painted that picture right over there, that's Marguerite on the wall.
Speaker 2: I was admiring that a few minutes ago.  I saw it, yeah, that's a finely done--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I thought if I researched his life, I'd say that that's probably the only black person he every painted.  And I'm sure--
Speaker 2: --Well, he did a great job.  I was looking at it.  I'm sure whoever did this really knows what he's doing.
Speaker 1: --that's, and a black women, I'm sure. He's dead now.  But he painted it and then he said--he did it from a photograph.  That's a social work outfit she got on, and we surprised her.  And he said, "Well, since I painted it, I'm going to frame it."  So he said, "I want it framed the way I said."  So he did the framing and everything.  Brought it out here and called her out and had it unveiled.  You may also hear a term Bouchet.  Edward Bouchet and Edward Bouchet is the first black person to receive a Ph.D. in physics--
Speaker 2: Right, yes, sir, right.
Speaker 1: --in this country.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know we always here these statements about being the first black, but Edward Bouchet was also like the third or fourth person to receive a Ph.D. from Yale in physics.  You know, I leave the black out of that, he's one of the--and I have his picture downstairs--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and the same fellow did that and that--that was in the dusty part of the shelves of Bouchet all about him.  And a friend of mine, a professor there, he was really the person who pushed it and worked with a fraternity to get Yale interested in Bouchet.  We brought it out, pulled it out of the dust and Yale commissioned this fellow to do a portrait of Bouchet, and now that portrait is hanging in the library of Yale.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And since I was involved the secretary of Yale gave me a copy.  It's as big as that one.  If you go downstairs you'll see Bouchet's painting that is signed by the same artist.  And, we now have Bouchet's scholarships and Yale gave him full recognition.
Story_ID: 27074
Speaker 1: And you know Bill Strickland [William Strickland, founder of the non-profit Manchester Bidwell Corporation], who has throughout the country, he has those training programs, are you familiar--?
Speaker 2: --Bill Strickland of the University of Massachusetts [Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts], that one, the professor?
Speaker 1: No, no.  Bill Strickland has--he came up about forty years ago with an organization that trains low performing students, black students. But he trains them for a specific thing.  If you're going to--you're going to get companies involved he says this is the kind of person we use for this job.  For instance like inputting data for medical data.  Every doctor now has to put everything in so that your record can be seen by any doctor that you go to.  But they have--if you talk to doctors they complain about the cost--what it's costing them to enter their medical records.  That's required now.  And [President Barack] Obama, he's really saying that's what every doctor has to do in Obamacare. So your medical record is now kept in someone's notebook, it's digitized and put into the system.  When I go to the doctor now, he comes out with a laptop, but he can see every doctor I've been to.  Well, these programs will train the people who just--who want to do that kind of job.  Well, [Carlton] Highsmith just opened up a training center here in Connecticut.  They took, I think, Strickland's place in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] is building with design by Frank Lloyd Wright and it's huge and it's like a $40 million facility.  We're renting--Highsmith is releasing land here, but he just got a $5 million program he just started.  People could learn how to take blood, so they go out--usually and after they finish they get a certificate and the companies that are putting in money already have a job for them.  So it's about eighty of these things across country.  It must have something in--I'd be surprised if it doesn't have one in Chicago [Illinois], a center.  But I wouldn't know it.  The fellow who did this his name is Bill Strickland and he--I have here--we gave him an honorary doctorate at Quinnipiac [University, Hamden, Connecticut], and he gave a speech.  I had him to send me a copy, and he said when he was a little boy in school in Pittsburgh, he wasn't doing good at all.  He had no interest in school and he went by, passed by a studio, art studio, and somebody was molding a sculpture, and he saw that, and interested, he went in and he met that person and the person took an interest in him and got him to an art school, and his--one of his big things--his feeling is that artwork can really help a person get into other--find themselves and get into other--so all these centers have an art section in them.  So they buy beautiful art and hang up and so the environment you bring these students into, this environment.  And so we just got Highsmith just put in money and the Pfitzers gave a million or two, that's how it--Pfitzers, so it's a new endeavor here and--
Speaker 2: You're sure involved in a lot of civic activities here?
Speaker 1: --I'm not.  Now my son is on the board for that.  I'm not but the fellow Highsmith is the chairman and he's the one who started it here because he brought Bill--
Speaker 2: That's Mr. Highsmith who was here early?
Speaker 1: --Yeah.  So he sold that packaging company, it was an international packaging company and he went down to the Cayman Islands and stayed for a few months and he and his wife and he came back and now he's given away money like he's crazy.  I'm sure the money he gives away is not going to hurt him, but he's given millions everywhere.
Story_ID: 27075
Speaker 1: Now, you've done a lot of travel. I know you were talking about it.  How many countries have you been to?
Speaker 2: Well, we started talking about it, we've been to Hungary.  My oldest son is a drummer, he married a Hungarian women who lives here [New Haven, Connecticut].  She was an interesting person. She was born in prison, a communist.  She was a communist, I guess, her father was communist.  And she's Hungarian Jewish, a Hungarian Jew.  And she has a brother, they were both separated, they were separated.  Her mother died in prison, but her father, she and her father weren't on speaking terms because he was, I guess, he was communist, I guess he was the communist.  And anyway, she sang.  She sang with a group in Budapest [Hungary] called (Kalinda?), and they went to Paris [France] to do a concert and she defected, and she met Steven, my son, and they got married.  And Steven brought her back here and they had, first a boy, that's the one who's in Chicago [Illinois].  And so she had American Citizen and then she has a daughter whose now in Chicago, and she just finished UMass [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts] and then Steven divorced.  So Agnes was here, beautiful woman in spirit, in everything.   They bought a house in Palo, Massachusetts, so she's still in that house, but she went to UMass, got her bachelors, got her masters, and now she's attendant teacher in high school in Amherst and after she got a divorce, she still kept in contact with us.  She comes here once a month just to check to see how we're doing right now and they've been divorced over twenty years, thirty years ago, I guess, going on twenty-seven years, because (Makia?) is twenty-eight.
Speaker 1: So how many children do you have?
Speaker 2: I have three children.  Now this is my oldest boy.  My oldest child is a girl, Carol, and Carol lives in California.  Her husband is a judge and he's Stanford [University, Stanford, California] graduate.  Carol went to Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts].  She is--right now she's in a job entitled financial counselor for a health organization, and her husband is a Stanford University graduate, he's a judge in California.  Then Steven who's a jazz musician, he plays, I know you've heard of him, Archie Shepp?  Stevie is Archie Shepp trio, Stevie is one of the trio, he's the drummer.  Then Paul, Paul went to Hampshire College [Amherst, Massachusetts] and Columbia [University, New York, New York] and Paul got his MBA from Columbia and so he's the senior vice president of a bank, and very active.  He married a young woman from Toledo, Ohio, who finished Yale Medical School [New Haven, Connecticut], so she's an OB/GYN [obstetrics and gynecology doctor].  And they live not too far from here in Cheshire and they have two girls.  That was one of the girls here. And those are the three children.  So they got three children and six grandchildren and one grandson who's in Paris with Steven.  And he's the youngest and two--the other two are Steven's, two--two children too.  So Steven has three other grandchildren, and that's the boy married this Indian woman, Dr. (Schama?), who teaches at Northwestern [University, Chicago, Illinois] and let's see and my daughter in California has a son who's at Cal Poly [California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, California] right now.  That's it, six grandchildren, three--and now I got, oh, (Makia?) has a little girl, the one in Chicago.  So we have a great grandchild.  Marguerite says she is not the great-grandmother, she's a grandmother who's great.

Speaker 1: So we went to Hungary, we went to China, we've been to Japan, we've been to Africa, we went to Ghana and we went to Egypt.
Speaker 2: I see a lot of beautiful African art in the house, I noticed that.
Speaker 1: We've been to Haiti, of course, Mexico, Italy, we had a very nice visit to Italy.  We were in Italy and we were--we [McCraven and wife, Marguerite] travel alone, just the two of us, we don't usually go in any groups.  But we were in Italy and we were sitting in a restaurant having dinner one night and the waiter came over and said there were two priests sitting at a table on the side and they heard us talking, so they told the waiter that they were inviting us to join them for dessert, and it turned out the year we were there was the year of the Ecumenical Council.  It hasn't been a council meeting since.  I know now the Ecumenical Council where all the cardinals meet there.  They're there now to choose a new pope.  But we were there at a time when all the cardinals were in Rome.  And so we went over and joined these two priests for dessert and they told us that they had a new cardinal who was African and got out a little pad, wrote a little note and said, "This will get you into the House of Cardinals to meet the African cardinal."  They wrote out another note that said, "This will get you in to meet the Pope."  And it turned out the Pope's date we weren't there.  But we did go to the House of Cardinals and we went in, we had nice long visit, about a half an hour's visit with this African Cardinal.  And that is when--now I don't know what year he was elected, but this was about year.  This is the first time they had a black cardinal.
Speaker 2: Where was he from, do you remember?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  That's easy, you can find that out--he's there today and the conclave is going to be first thing he asked me about was the Yankees.
Speaker 2: He's a baseball fan?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a baseball fan.  So that was an experience.  We've had these kinds of experiences.  Want to know another story? A story about Egypt.  We went to--we were in--I forget the name now, what's the capital?
Speaker 2: Cairo.
Speaker 1: We were in Cairo and we went to another city.
Speaker 2: Usually people go to Alexandria, Cairo, Luxor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, we did all that tour.  We did it by boat.  But I guess we went to Alexandria.  I guess it was in Alexandria.
Speaker 2: That's the one upon the Mediterranean.
Speaker 1: And we were in this very nice hotel and it was gated, gated hotel.  And we were sitting, eating, and they had this buffet out and it was upon a raised platform and all this beautiful food displayed all around the wall.  And I looked up and there was this little child got upon and running around on the buffet table--
Speaker 2: He was running on top?
Speaker 1: --so, hair hanging all down, so Marguerite told the waiter, he asked her something, and Marguerite said, "That little girl shouldn't be up there where the food is."  We're down--now we're down in Egypt, she's telling this waiter.  So finally the waiter said, "Ma'am, first of all, that's not a little girl, that's a little boy and second that's Farouk's grandson, and he can run wherever he wants to run."  So that was our Egypt experience.
Speaker 2: So that's King Farouk's grandson?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he can run wherever he wants to run.

Speaker 1: Then we went to Haiti, we spent time in Haiti.  Marguerite's--a very international family.  Marguerite's brother married a Haitian woman, and her father was secretary of the army there in Haiti, or something.  He was in prison.  Papa Doc had him in prison, he died in prison.  So they moved his wife and some of his children all moved to Washington, D.C., Silver Spring, Maryland.  And we've been there to visit.  I can't think of all--we've done a lot of travelling.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I know you were saying you were bound to try to travel as much as you could?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Not to put it off.
Speaker 1: Now we aren't--we've been to Hawaii.  Of course we went to Hawaii a number of times, because the testing at Bikini Atoll, the place where you come back for R&R [rest and recuperation] is Hawaii, that's the step-off point.  So when I went to Bikini Atoll to do testing, Marguerite came to Hawaii and the University [of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California] provided hotel reservations in Hawaii so she could be there while I was out on the test site and then I'd come back and join her on my rest time.  So we did that two or three times.  Going back to Hawaii to the other islands at different times, so we've been to Kauai and the big island Aloha--Oahu, Maui, so we've had--she loves Hawaii.  She likes her warm weather.  When I took the job in Connecticut, she said, "We'll go to Connecticut if that'll help your career, but we're coming back to California."  We lived in Palo Alto [California], and we haven't gotten back there yet.
Story_ID: 27078
Speaker 1: In terms of your career, when you look back at your career, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I think, well, the one thing I give a thought to, I said, "If I had to do things, the decisions looking back I wouldn't change anything," because I guess the reason I say that is because I look where I am and we are very happy and content, we're pleased with our family and you know the children, the grandchildren and with my health.  Everything's pretty good for us and so I think it must be that if you're destined to make these steps, I wouldn't want anything--I wouldn't want a different outcome.  So I wouldn't make a different decision, because I want to end up where we are now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  But what would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: I feel that I was able to contribute in both areas, to the area of the nuclear development.  I think I did--I did my best there and I--but I really enjoyed working with utilities.  So I ended up liking both, working in both jobs.  So a legacy, I just have to--I look back and say favorably on what I contributed in the nuclear development field, but I really have enjoyed being with the utilities, you know, and I think we ended up being happy in my work and with a beautiful, beautiful family.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, what I--my biggest--my efforts have gone to make sure that our young people are in school.  And I stress the importance of going to college.  So the first thing I want is opportunities for all young people to go to college.  At some point here when we made a decision that everybody should have a high school education.  Now when was that?  You probably know, a historian, you know when that decision was made when everybody goes to high school.
Speaker 1: That's the early part of the century, basically.
Speaker 2: I thought it was even dated further back.
Speaker 1: Not really, because a lot of times didn't have a high school until (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: Okay, but nothing has changed.  What's needed now, you need a college education.  So really, if whatever people make the decision that everybody should go to high school, should be the ones that makes the decision now to say that everybody needs at least a college education.  So my hope for the African community is that we get our kids in school and we get them to college.  And I'm, I'm also a big supporter of health care.  So I'm all for Obamacare being a big success.  I think for so long people have not had health care and so education and health, I guess health probably comes first.  If you're not healthy, you're not going to be successful in a lot of areas.
Story_ID: 27080
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would like to be remembered as a person who really cared about my fellow man.  That people that I know would think that I--my first concern is them.  And I have a lot of friends, and fortunate to have friendship with a lot of people and Marguerite is--she's the most caring, one of the most caring people.  Everybody she--anything that she can do for anyone, she feel that she must do it and so growing up--living with her and seeing how she feels about the other person has really, I guess, influenced me in some ways.  I'd like for people to think they knew somebody who cared about them.
Story_ID: 27081
Speaker 1: Just tell us who it is.
Speaker 2: Yes, this is my great granddaddy.
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: That's Henry McCraven and that's where the name came from.  He's the one who changed his name from Mac Craven to McCraven.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.
Speaker 2: And, let me see.  Okay.  This is the immediate family.  That's--look a little younger then, but that's me and Marguerite and our three children, Stevie on the left, Carol Ivy in the middle and Paul on the right-hand side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About what year is this?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was, I would say in the '60s (1960s).  That was taken here, so that was after we moved to Connecticut.  So we came here in '64 (1964), and so I would say that's maybe five years later, maybe '70 (1970), no later than 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is my great-grandfather's brother, John Cravens, and he--this is a critique he wrote of Charles--Carol's book on 'Negro: A Beast,' so he critiqued that story and he, this brother ended up in Missouri.  He stayed in Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he kept the name Craven?
Speaker 2: Yes, he has it with an "S".  This is--shows my clearance; that's a Q clearance and that was the pass I used to go on project Gnome, which is Operation Plowshare in Carlsbad, New Mexico.  My great-grandmother on my daddy's side of the family and that's me, she's holding me.  That's just another shot of my great-grandfather, the one where the name arrived, that's Henry McCraven.  Now, that's a picture of me and my brother Carl.  I'm the oldest and the tallest there and end up, Carl, he was taller than--in the later years he was taller than I am, but that's Carl McCraven.  This is my mother's [Buena Vista Rollins] sister with me.  This is the woman who had so much influence on me.  This is the one who drove to school in a buggy.  She's from Port Gibson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Stella King.  There's the McCraven family.  In the back, going left to right, that's my daughter and her husband, Jonathan Ivy, Judge, and their son, Jonathan, Jr., the next person is Cynthia McCraven, Dr. McCraven, she's an OB/GYN [obstetrics and gynecology doctor], my son Paul, who's the senior vice president of the First Niagra Bank, the two little girls down here are their children, and me and Marguerite in the middle.  That's my prize dog, the dog that won a lot of prizes, that's Trac, T-R-A-C.  Now, that name the dog--when I got him, he had already been given the name and the name was Fatal Attraction.  So I registered and changed that name to--I shortened it to Trac, T-R-A-C.  That is a digital diagnostic system that I put together.  That will record a number of functions reaction history in an exploding device.
Speaker 1: The technology in that could be now held in the size of your hand?
Speaker 2: Well, it might not get it that small, but now it wouldn't be anywhere near that large.  That's one of the first digital systems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That shows a picture of me when I was appointed to advisory committee of EPA [Environmental Protection Agency].  I was on two committees, I was on the--I was charter member of the executive advisory committee for the formation of EPA and also for the equipment.  I was a member of two different committees.  This one is an article published at my retirement and all the good words that the president said at my retirement which I certainly appreciate.  That's the same that's in that copy I gave you to take about what the president said, that's a publication of it.  And that Henry McCraven when he first came to Iowa.  Now that's a picture of Edward Bouchet.  And Edward Bouchet was the first black to receive a Ph.D. in physics from Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut].  And I want to point out he's one of the first people to receive a Ph.D. in physics from Yale, like maybe there are two or three others, but he's in the top of those graduates.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're the first person whose ever said that.  But I hear about him a lot, but nobody--they say the first black person to get his Ph.D. in physics, but they never explained that.  (unclear sentence)
Speaker 2: I think what's important is--
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about this?
Speaker 2: --This is a certificate given to me for my participation in Operation Plowshare and that experiment was performed in Carlsbad, New Mexico, peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Each one of the operations-every time there was a nuclear device fired and that you participated in, you were issued a certificate, that's Operation NuGet.  And let's see, this is interesting because this is what's called Operation Plumbbob and that is the reason--there are different configurations for tests.  Devices were checked and mounted on towers and some were on barges and some were on balloons.  This is the balloon one, Operation Plumbbob, and then all tests, above-ground tests were stopped.  And in the later years all tests were done in a cave underground.  And that's Operation Hardtack.  So what you've got going here the certificates of some of the different tests that I was involved with.
