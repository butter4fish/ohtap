 Gill. Today is February 19, 2010 and I   m visiting with  Jacqueline Bennett Holmes in her sister   s home here in Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Jacqueline, I know you live  in Florida and I appreciate you taking time for this interview on your  trip to Oklahoma. You   re a member of a family that   s very special to  Oklahoma State University, the Bennett family. Dr. Henry G. Bennett,  your grandfather, was president of Oklahoma A   M College from 1928  until his untimely death in 1951. Dr. Bennett and his wife Vera had five  children   Henry Jr., Phil, Liberty, Mary and Thomas. You   re the  daughter of Henry Bennett, Jr. and Josephine St. Clair. As I understand  from our conversation with Nancy, you   re perhaps the first grandchild  of the Bennetts, is that right?  Yes, I was the oldest anyway.  First of all, Jacqueline, of course certainly we want to talk about your  grandfather, but I   d like to learn more about you and a little bit about  your early life. Can you share some of where you grew up, a little bit  about your family, your early life?  I was born in Baltimore. My father was at Johns Hopkins Medical  School and then he took five years of additional training there so I was,  at that point, going to school. I went to the Calvert School in Baltimore,  which is still in existence and is still an excellent school. In 1941, we  moved back to Oklahoma. Daddy was in practice one month before he  was called in to the service and we joined him in Virginia, having  departed Oklahoma on December 7, 1941. Actually, my early days were  spent with my grandparents. I spent every summer there for probably  eight years. Then I spent a lot of time  there  when we lived in  Oklahoma City, as well. But I spent all my summers there before.  5  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  So you got a chance to know them very well.  Yes.  Growing up, were there some values that you learned from your  immediate family and from your grandparents that were important to  you, that helped shape you in your later life?  Well, I would say that education was the primary objective and excelling  in everything that we could do. Also that there was nothing we couldn   t  do. I think that was instilled in us from the first, to have high goals and  not to ever think that you couldn   t do something.  What schools did you attend? Did you attend Classen High School in  Oklahoma City?  Yes, I attended Nichols Hill School, Harding and Classen High School.  Were you involved in some student activities in high school   community  activities?  Oh, yes. I was involved in a lot of things but I really don   t remember the  connections.  Now, did you go to Oklahoma State University?  I only went to Oklahoma State, which was Oklahoma A   M, for one  year. I graduated from Wellesley. I spent my first year at Wellesley, my  sophomore year at A   M, and my junior and senior years at Wellesley.  Was there a reason for you coming back and spending that year at  Oklahoma State after that first year?  Well I was interested in being at the school just for a time, but I was  very interested in going back to Wellesley.  When Dr. Bennett and his wife died in the plane crash, how old were  you then?  I was nineteen, probably, and I was a junior in college.  So you were actually a student there at Oklahoma State at that time?  Well, yes, I was there and I saw a lot of them at that time.  When you were at Oklahoma State, what was your major?  6  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  I was always an art history major at Wellesley but I took many other  courses there such as physics and economics and things like that.  Are there some faculty members that you recall from your time there?  No.  Were you involved in any activities or social organizations?  No, not really.  Can you tell me a little about your Wellesley experience?  Well, I was an art history major and I enjoyed the experience. It was a  very, I guess, high level academic experience. They had wonderful  professors, particularly in the art history department. They also had what  we referred to as    general examinations.    At the end of the four years,  you had to take a test which supposedly joined everything that you had  learned there. So you had to really study for every course that you had  ever taken there. It was an incredible experience because you did pull it  all together.  Kind of like the German experience in higher education, where they do  their finals at the end of the term for that whole four years. Whether you  pass or fail, there   s a little bit of pressure there, isn   t there?  Yes.  Going back to your Oklahoma State experience, did you live with your  grandparents when you were going to school there?  No, I didn   t.  Did you live on campus?  No, I lived in the Pi Phi House.  Nancy said she went to Kappa to the great chagrin of the Bennett  women.  Yes.  There was a great tradition, if I recall, of the Bennett women in the Pi  Phi house. Can you share a little about your life journey and about your  professional career after you graduated from Wellesley?  7  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Well, I actually went to New York after I graduated. I was in the  advertising business for about four or five years and did market research.  It was a very timely thing because market research was just developing  at that time and I was able to be a part of that growth. It was a great  experience. I love New York. I married there and then came back to my  husband   s hometown, which was Jacksonville, Florida.  You   re with, is it JHA? Fine Art Today?  It   s called Jacqueline Holmes and Associates, Inc. I   m a consultant and I  developed the business from a gallery which I started in 1962 and then  developed it into an art consulting firm where I mainly advised  corporations on buying art. My primary client early on was IBM   International Business Machines  and I did buildings for them     probably thirteen buildings from Vermont to Florida and a lot of banks  and we also worked with AT T  American Telephone and Telegraph .  Right now I am a curator for the Bank of America and help them with  their art program.  Do you ever do any art work yourself, personally?  No.  So your career started off pretty much in advertising, which is an  interesting shift for you in the New York market. At what point did you  begin to change your emphasis on your career from advertising and  marketing more into art work?  Well, I did it when I moved because there was no opportunity for  advertising in Jacksonville, Florida at that time. We had a good friend  who was an architect who had become a collector of art and was very  interested in Southeastern artists. That   s the way we began the gallery, to  represent fine artists in the Southeast, because there was very little  opportunity for them to show in that area. After that, I dealt with artists  who were more widely known   very well-known artists. Actually one  of the more interesting things that we did was the Pennsylvania  Convention Center, which is an odd place for art, but they had a very  large budget   the largest budget for public art in Pennsylvania and we  were able to do some really fantastic commissions of art and also to buy  art for the project.  Jacqueline, I know when you   re working with customers of course, it   s  whatever their taste is and what interests they have, but for you  personally, do you have some particular artist or art forms that you like  better than the other?  8  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  I sort of grew up in the abstract expressionist age and I am very  interested in that kind of art. I put together a very large private  collection, which is in Jacksonville, Florida and it is pretty outstanding, I  think. I did that in addition to the corporate art. Most of my work was  outside of Florida, but this is one opportunity that I had to buy abstract  expressionist paintings and it   s a good collection.  Are there some artists people would recognize in that field?  Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Robert Motherwell, Helen Frankenthaler;  those are among the most outstanding artists of that period.  Do you have any feel for where your interest in art came from? Did you  have it as a child growing up? Were you always interested in art?  Yes, I had been and the only opportunity that I had growing up was to  actually do it. I did take studio courses but I found that my real interest  was in the history of art.  Have there been some career highlights for you, Jacqueline, some  special recognitions or honors that you received that you could share  with us?  Well, not really. I   ve done a lot of things. I   ve been on the board of the  art museum, vice-president of the board. I was chairman of the board of  the Ringling Museum, which is the Florida State Museum. I started the  Arts Council in Jacksonville, which is now called the Cultural Council  of Greater Jacksonville and I was president of that. Just a lot of things  like that.  Can we shift gears and talk a little bit about your parents, first of all,  your father. What do you remember about your father? His personality,  personal traits that you recall?  He was a very intelligent person and he really spent most of his life  working as a doctor. He was a gynecologist, which is an unusual  specialty without doing any OB  obstetrics , but that was his interest. He  trained with one of the great doctors in that specialty, Dr. TeLinde at  Johns Hopkins. He didn   t really have a lot of other interests other than  reading. He saw some of his contemporaries dying of heart attacks at  early ages so he took up fishing. I   m not sure that he ever really enjoyed  that much. He loved to travel. We took a lot of trips across country.  Starting in Oklahoma, we could go east one summer and west another.  We covered a lot of territory. It was very educational. I   ve never enjoyed  driving in the car since then, but we went to every state in the United  States except North and South Dakota. Most of that was done after the  9  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  war.  Your father, didn   t he graduate early from college? I mean, he was  young when he graduated.  Oh yes, he was eighteen. He was the youngest person ever accepted at  Hopkins Medical School.  Do you know, Jacqueline, how he was able to   I guess he would have  then entered OSU, or A M at the time, when he was fourteen, fifteen  years old?  Fourteen. Yes, well I think the reason was that in Durant, they had the  school attached to the college so they didn   t have much else to do, so  they went all year.  Through summers, year-round.  Absolutely. So, he just finished early. He had graduated from high  school. One thing that he lacked for medical school was he had not taken  any German and at that time most of the texts were written in German,  or a lot of them were. It was a requirement to have two years of German.  So he managed to get that qualification in three months.  (Laughs) Kind of sounds like his father when he got his PhD in one year.  There were some good genes there in that family, weren   t there?  Right, yes.  Well I understand that your father was highly thought of in the  Oklahoma City area and     Yes, I think he was.  And he was at Baptist Hospital for many years?  Yes, he was Chief of Staff from the beginning until he died, which was  probably twenty-five years.  Do you recall any stories that your father used to tell about his family,  his brothers and sisters and parents, when he was growing up in Durant  or in Stillwater or in Hugo?  I guess one of the real stories, and this has a lot to do with my  grandmother, Granddaddy traveled a lot and was very tied up a lot and  so he didn   t usually take trips with the family. I guess there was a trip  10  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  planned to Colorado and he wasn   t able to go. My father was about  twelve at the time, so he did all the driving, including going up Pikes  Peak.  At twelve. (Laughs) Henry was the oldest child, right?  Yes.  But at twelve years old he was driving the family car.  And my grandmother would never have thought a thing about it. She just  had confidence in him. She was not one to worry about anything.  She was a pretty good driver herself. She would drive down to  Oklahoma City an awful lot by herself.  Oh, yes.  Did your father ever talk about his growing up in the presidential home?  Was that different? I mean, he was a student going to OSU and living in  the president   s home.  He never talked about that, no.  Had to have been a little bit different experience.  Yes, I   m sure it was. I stayed there a lot   I was there all those summers.  What do you remember about your mother, Josephine St. Clair?  Well, she was a very nice lady and she had to take care of us,  particularly when Daddy was off in the war. I   m sure that that was  difficult. It was a very trying time for her and she was not a person who  really liked to do things much. She was a very home-oriented person.  She had some very good friends who lived here and that was really  important to her. She took part in all of our school activities but she was  not a very outgoing person.  She grew up in Perry, is that right?  That   s right. Youngest of five children, but the youngest one was ten  years older than she so was kind of like an only child.  Where was your father assigned in World War II? What theatre was he  in?  11  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Well at first he was in Virginia and then he was assigned overseas and  actually went to California for awhile and Mother went out there  because there were delays. They were not shipping them out as soon as  they thought. But he went to Australia and then to New Guinea. He was  stationed with an infantry core   strange place for a gynecologist. Then,  unfortunately, New Guinea was a very serious battleground and before  he got there, our side was not winning. There had to be a lot of retrieval  of dead soldiers and he had to participate in that. He then got malaria  and was sent to Australia and he kind of got lost in the system. He found  out that a lot of his buddies from Hopkins were in Sydney. They had  formed a unit and they had a hospital and all, so he managed to get  himself assigned there. He spent about two years in Australia in Sydney.  I think that was a positive experience for him because he loved the  Australians and he really got a lot out of that. He always wanted to go  back but Mother was not one to travel halfway around the world. But I  think he really enjoyed it.  Let   s talk about Henry and Vera Bennett and your memories there.  From our conversation you must have stayed fairly frequently in the  home and certainly during the war you spent a lot of time with the  Bennetts in their home in Stillwater?  Well, yes. When we were living in Baltimore, I went every summer and  spent the whole three months there. Then after that, when we lived in  Oklahoma City, we were over there a lot. But just day to day we went on  trips, everything was very positive there. I spent a lot of time with my  Aunt Mary, who was only twelve years older than I was and she just  spoiled me rotten. (Laughter) And Grandmother and Granddaddy did,  too. We would go out to Yost. Is that still there?  It   s still there.  We spent a lot of time swimming at Yost and then Crystal Plunge   we  went swimming there. We   d come to Oklahoma City. Granddaddy had a  suite at the Skirvin Hotel where he   d have meetings and stuff. I  remember it had sliding doors and I was fascinated by those. Then we   d  go to Spring Lake, which was an amusement park at that time. I  remember I saw The Wizard of Oz there. Then, as I say, we went on  some trips. Sometimes Grandmother would come up to take me back to  Oklahoma on the train. That was always fun. Then one time,  Granddaddy took me back. We stopped in Cincinnati. He was meeting  with his publishers so the secretary got stuck with me and was told, I  guess, to buy me anything I wanted. (Laughter)  Good deal.  12  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  I bought a leash for my dog, which was in Oklahoma. They had bought a  puppy for me and he stayed there in Oklahoma. His name was Budgy.  So I bought him a leash.  When your parents were in Baltimore and you were spending summers   in Oklahoma , how old were you in those years?  Oh, as I say, I probably started when I was two years old. Then I went  on until I was nine and then I spent a lot of time, but not the whole  summer when we lived here. I remember going to Rochester with him.  Granddaddy was plagued with laryngitis. He really had a problem with  it. He was doing so much speaking. He went up to Mayo Clinic and we  went up there with him in Rochester. I remember being impressed with  the fact that you could go downstairs into the hotel in the basement and  walk across through a tunnel into Mayo Clinic.  Jacqueline, you spent a lot of time in the president   s home. What do you  remember about the president   s home?  Oh, I remember it very well.  Can you talk about the layout and what it was like?  Well originally, I think there were about five bedrooms upstairs. One of  them was designated as the guest room. I stayed there sometimes. Then  Tom had a room and Mary had a room and Libby had a room. Libby   s  room was later turned into the silver room where Grandmother had cases  for all her collection of silver, which was very, very extensive. Then  Granddaddy had his library up there   an office and a lot of bookcases. It  was just really a huge library. Then I think there was a porch outside  where sometimes we slept, a sleeping porch. Then the downstairs was a  huge kitchen and a big dining room. I remember it was always set for  about twelve because Granddaddy always brought people home for  lunch. The cook was Dora, who was about two hundred pounds and five  feet tall. Then her husband Y.C. would serve and then various of her  sisters would come in whenever needed. Then there was a living room, a  big living room and a sun porch and then a music room. My Aunt Mary  played the harp and then various people played the piano. That was  called the music room.  Then there was a basement, which is where students were often bunked.  Anybody that didn   t have a place, Grandmother would always invite  them in. A lot of the Indian students (now we call them Native  Americans but she called them Indians). She went to an Indian school in  Durant and she was always very, very interested in the Indian students.  They gave her many, many things, many objects, paintings    I   m sorry  13  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  to say that they were all given to OSU and now they can   t be found. I  don   t know what happened to them. But she was very interested in those  people and there was always somebody down there sleeping, or they just  had beds. I   d sleep down there sometimes in the summer when it got  really hot   no air conditioning.  I   d heard that a lot of times a student, a guest would just drop in, I  mean, it wasn   t unusual at all to be feeding people, have them spend the  night if they just happened to show up. Is that true?  I don   t remember. I mean, students would sleep downstairs, but I don   t  remember too many people coming in and sleeping upstairs. Maybe  some, but definitely lunch was the big meal of the day and Granddaddy  would bring people home then.  Could you describe what a meal was like when you had the formal sit-down  meal there in the dining room?  Well, fried chicken was a big item and cornbread and biscuits   always  potatoes and vegetables. It was a big meal.  I   d heard Dr. Bennett himself sometimes would   he   d always get up  early but he   d sometimes cook breakfast or fix biscuits himself. Do you  remember that?  I really don   t. There was usually oatmeal and biscuits and stuff for  breakfast, but I remember Dora usually was there, even for breakfast.  One thing we did in the early morning though was go out and look at the  cows and the pigs and take in the barns out there, part of A M, you  know. We always enjoyed that.  I heard on Sundays a lot of times the family would drive up and get  together with other family members. What do you remember about  family get-togethers and socials there in the home?  Well once we lived in Oklahoma City we would go over there for lunch  on Sundays sometimes.  Pretty regular?  Fairly regularly, yes. Then some of the other people who lived in  Oklahoma City or Stillwater would come, as well.  I understand that sometimes if there was not enough room around the  table, they   d have card tables set up around to make room for  everybody.  14  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Yes.  Did Dr. Bennett preside over the   was it fairly formal, those events?  Not really formal   I mean, he always sat at the head of the table and  said a prayer, but otherwise I would consider it to be pretty informal.  Talk a little bit about your grandmother, Vera. From what I   ve heard in  other conversations, she was a pretty special lady. We think of her as a  public figure, but as a grandmother, what was she like? What do you  remember about her?  Well, she would do about anything you wanted her to. She was very  relaxed. I remember I used to walk around the campus all the time,  unsupervised   roller-skate and do stuff like that, whereas my mother  would be supervising me. She wouldn   t have me wandering around.  Grandmother just didn   t have any nerves, I don   t think. She just assumed  everything would be okay. She really was very relaxed but she was  always very giving. Pretty much anything I wanted to do, she would do.  You had the ideal grandmother, it sounds like.  Yes. And one time Granddaddy was going out to fly to a ranch   I think  it was Governor Turner   s ranch   with the Flying Farmers of America.  They were all gathering in their planes so my grandmother and I were  taking him out there and he said,    Would you like to go?    And I said,     Well, yes. I   d love to go.    I had never flown, nor had Grandmother.  When she realized that I was going, she said,    I   m coming, too.     (Laughter)  What do you remember about the flight?  I mean, it was     Had to be exciting for you.  Well, yes, it was very exciting. It was a small plane   very small plane.  Yes, I enjoyed it very much. Then we went over there to the ranch and  had lunch and then flew back.  I understand that Vera was a strong Christian. She taught Sunday  school, the women   s Sunday school class here in the First Baptist  Church. Did she ever spend time with you on your faith, like reading  Bible stories or reading the Bible or through prayer, do you recall?  Well, I think she did some. It wasn   t an overriding thing with her. In  15  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  other words, she didn   t spend all of her time doing that. She had a lot of  interests and she pursued them and she was probably the original  women   s   not libber, but she really was very strong on women   s ability  to do anything they wanted to. And I think that was a pervasive thing. I  mean, she just did everything.  Was that a strong influence on you growing up as a child?  Yes.  A strong figure.  Yes, I think that I probably got a lot of values from her and she didn   t  think that there was anything that I couldn   t do. So she was a very  gracious lady. She loved stylish clothes; she really did. She always wore  the latest thing. She loved shoes and she loved her silver. That was really  a very important part of her life. She and Tom, actually, would go to the  East Coast   Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina   and they  would dig around in these antique shops. She had a man in, I think it was  in Boston, who would re-silver a lot of things, so a lot of the very fine  English silver is silver-plate. In other words it   s not sterling. Sterling is  very soft. The pieces that have survived, many of them are plate. You   ve  heard of Sheffield Plate, stuff like that. So she was able to buy these  things which would look very tarnished and worn and then send them up  to this guy in Boston and they   d come back looking like new. I don   t  know where she ever found him. She had priceless pieces. Nancy  probably told you that all of ours were stolen.  No, I was going to ask you what happened to the collection.  Well she had always planned on having something for every child. She  had five silver tea services, she had five wine tankards. You probably  saw some of it over at Lela   s house. When she went to South America,  she had commissioned silver   solid silver   and this was more silver  than sterling, because down there they have a different kind of process  and it was very soft. She had serving plates, which nobody uses  anymore   service plates   salad plates and finger bowls commissioned.  There were twelve of them each. We had those but it was all stolen.  Someone came into the home and stole it?  Yes.  Oh, gosh. So Lela has some and the other grandkids have some?  Yes, all the other people have their portion but ours was all lost.  16  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  That   s a shame. Now I understand that she was what we   d maybe call  nowadays a power-shopper. She was a pretty good shopper. She enjoyed  shopping. Did you ever go out on some of the shopping trips with her?  Oh, yes.  What was that like?  Well, she had very good taste and she enjoyed buying nice clothes and  she bought things for me, too. Granddaddy actually bought her clothes,  too. He had an incredible ability to buy something that fit you. He  bought my sixth-grade graduation dress. Never asked the size and he just  bought a beautiful dress. And when he was in Paris after the war, he  went to one of the salons and picked out a model who looked about  grandmother   s size and had her try on different clothes and he bought  her several nice outfits.  Wow. I bet she was excited about that.  Yes. Right. He was an incredible shopper, too.  Jacqueline, speaking of your grandfather, what do you remember most  about him? Not the public figure, but as a person.  Well, he was around. He would be at the house during the luncheons but  he would also be traveling some. I don   t know, he just was a very kind  person and he also had a good sense of humor. He enjoyed talking to  people and he talked to me a lot. He was a very enjoyable person to be  around, but he was very oriented towards his business, which was  running the college. Frequently people would come to the house to meet  with him.  Did you ever go to his office?  Oh, yes. I loved to go to the office. I was particularly intrigued with  office supplies. I would always go over and come back with a big pad of  paper and pencils and stuff like that. He would let his secretary give me  the run of the office supplies.  I understand from visiting with Nancy that if he wasn   t seeing a person  at that time, didn   t have an appointment in his office, you could just go  into his office and see him.  Yes, I would.  A little unusual, if you think about that, particularly in today   s society,  17  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  that would be very unusual   walking in any time into the president   s  office. Was he pretty accommodating? Of course he was busy, but would  he just say hello and let you play in the office?  Oh yes, we spent a lot of time over there. Another thing that I guess I  was thinking that I was going to mention was when I was a Campfire  Girl we sold donuts and I didn   t particularly like going door to door, so I  decided to call Granddaddy and ask him if I could call one of the  dormitories and get an order from them. So I got a hundred dozen.  (Laughs)  He turned me down one time and that was when we were all going  around collecting scrap metal and I wanted to win again and so I had  always noticed the cannon sitting in front of the Engineering building. I  thought that might be a nice piece that we could add to the scrap metal  pile. (Laughter) But he didn   t let me have that.  That was off-limits, huh? Did you spend a lot of time on campus? You   d  be what, about grade school age about this time?  Yes.  So Theta Pond, did they still water the animals at Theta Pond?  We used to go down and catch tadpoles down there. I don   t remember  what else. Of course, one thing that Granddaddy did was plant all those  weeping willows. Everybody told him that they wouldn   t grow and he  planted a lot of those and magnolias, too. I remember those weeping  willows down by Theta Pond. All I can remember doing down there is  catching tadpoles.  Like his wife, Henry was a strong Christian. He taught the men   s Sunday  school class and I think his wife taught the women   s Sunday school  class.  Yes.  What do you remember about his faith and his spirituality?  I don   t know. He didn   t make a big deal of it. Neither of them did. I  mean, they taught the Sunday schools, but they didn   t unload it on you. I  guess I was always aware that we were a Christian family but they didn   t  make me go to Sunday school every week.  Did you ever go to your grandmother   s Sunday school class when she  taught?  18  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  I don   t think so. I don   t remember.  Your grandfather led by example in his faith, in his life. But did he ever  visit with you and share some of his philosophy about life or some  practical advice that he might have shared with you?  I don   t think so. I think that he just shared that by example, you know.  We always knew what the rights and wrongs were and he didn   t lay it on  you. I mean there were certain rules, like we couldn   t go to the movies  on Sunday, we couldn   t play cards on Sunday. I think that swimming  was looked down upon but I think we got around that. (Laughter)  This was at Crystal Plunge? And you indicated earlier you went to Yost  Lake.  Oh yes. Yes, we used to go to Yost a lot. And we sometimes went on the  train, Puddle Jumper. That was fun. I always used to love that. But most  of the time we went by car.  That   d be like a family picnic, when you got there you   d swim, picnic     Yes, usually I went with my Aunt Mary and sometimes Emmadell, who  was to be Tom   s wife. She would go with us and we would swim and  have lunch. I don   t remember whether we took lunch or whether we ate  out there.  You might not have realized all of it at the time, but looking back, how  did your grandfather, Dr. Bennett, influence your life?  Well I think he gave me very high goals and I think that learning, of  course, was very important to him. Getting a good education was  primary. Also, giving back   giving back to the community. I   ve tried to  do that. I think he just set high goals. He was certainly a person who  attained many of his goals, but I think he always had more. I think he  passed that on to us. I think that all of us felt like we had to achieve well.  Was this part of your background of your interest in going to Wellesley,  which was certainly one of the premier women   s universities and it still  is today, in the United States   to get all the education, to get as high  quality education as you could get?  Right. Yes, he encouraged me to go to Wellesley. He was glad that I did  well there. I spent one year at OSU and then I went back, but it was an  important thing to me.  I guess you were old enough at the time to probably know how special  19  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  an individual he was. Obviously President of the university, but then he  became Director of the U.S. Point Four Program. Was this a source of  pride for you, knowing that he held these positions? Not just as a  powerful figure but that he was that involved on an international scale?  Yes. I was in college in Wellesley at the time that he took on that Point  Four and I was very proud of him. Of course, he did achieve a lot. When  he was at Columbia, getting his PhD, he met John D. Rockefeller. He  went to his Sunday school class and they became very good friends. He  went home with them and had dinner and became very good friends with  Nelson Rockefeller and they kept up. He was very well connected in that  way.  I had not heard that story. So your grandfather actually attended John  D. Rockefeller   s Sunday school class   Rockefeller was the teacher in  the class that he attended?  Yes.  Two Sunday school teachers getting together. Interesting. Did he ever  share any insights about that relationship?  Not really. I just knew about it. I think John D. Rockefeller used to  spread coins around to the children. He liked to do that. He was a very  devout Christian. I think the church St. John the Divine is primarily  funded by the Rockefellers.  So Nelson was John D.   s son, so he got to know Nelson then, as well.  Yes.  Interesting. And if I recall, in about a year   s time he did about a three-year  doctoral program     I think it was two years. I think 1924,    25, something like that. Maybe     26.  How did you hear the stories about his relationship with the  Rockefellers? The reason I ask is that had not come up in conversations  with the rest of the family.  I think he told me.  So you were a freshman at Wellesley when he was appointed Point Four  Director in 1950. Would that be about right?  20  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  You know, I thought it was later than that but I was a freshman at  Wellesley in 1950.  What do you remember about his philosophy of the Point Four  international technical educational assistance?  The main thing was,    Don   t give it away if it can   t be used.    So I think  the theory was certainly to educate people and in more ways than  technical, but certainly to teach them to use the tools that we were going  to give them. I think that the present administration could learn a lot  from that because I don   t think that we   ve followed that rule. Giving  money doesn   t always do the job. I mean, Haiti is a perfect example of  it. They   re worse off than they were but they were pretty bad off before.  What they need is education, not just money.  Jacqueline, picking up on your conversation about your grandfather,  Dr. Bennett   s philosophy of Point Four. You had talked a little bit about  our current  state  and probably could say for the last many years of  international relations in that he was director of the Point Four  program, which is the direct predecessor of USAID  United States  Agency for International Development  today. Would our program be a  little bit different after using Dr. Bennett   s philosophy and in what ways  would our international technical assistance programs be different?  Well I don   t know a lot about what the present day  situation  is, but I  don   t think that they are influenced by the need for education as much as  he would emphasize that. I think that   s, to my mind, the core of all  international relations. If you can educate people so that they can think  clearly and do things, that   s going to make a better world. I don   t think  that a lot of areas in the world are getting that education, particularly the  so-called Third World  countries , which was what he was working in.  Do you remember anything about his travels when he was director of  Point Four?  I remember just the South American trip. Now, he went to Bavaria but I  think that was before Point Four. I think that he was just asked to go  over there to assess their agricultural situation after the war. I   m not sure  whether that was a part of the Point Four or not. But he did go, certainly,  to Ethiopia several times. Of course, he started the college there.  How did you hear about the plane crash?  Well, I was at home, I was on vacation, and Daddy had a phone call  early in the morning. Frankly, I don   t know who it was from. We were  talking about that the other night. I   m not sure who it was from.  21  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Did you attend the memorial services in Gallagher Hall?  You know, that is a blank in my mind. I don   t think that I did. I think  that I was back at school. Daddy was funny about funerals. He didn   t  like them and he didn   t go to them. I just don   t know whether I went or  not. I can   t believe that I can   t remember, but I don   t remember.  What was your dad   s reaction, do you remember, to the news and how  he dealt with that in the following days and weeks?  Well the first thing he did was go make his rounds at the hospital and I  went with him. He didn   t talk much about it. Of course, Granddaddy  always loved flying. I remember when he would come to Washington he  would always come to Baltimore to see us. He would fly from Dallas on  an overnight plane. They had sleepers and all that, so he really loved  flying. It   s kind of ironic that he met his death there.  He was one of the proponents and one of the leaders, as you indicated  earlier, in the Flying Farmers National Association.  Oh right, yes, he was very key in that. He kind of made it happen.  An interesting connection between him and Will Rogers, they were both  very much aviation enthusiasts     That   s right, yes.     and promoted air travel. Both wound up losing their lives in airplane  crashes. Jacqueline, from your perspective, you had a chance as young  person but now looking back through your life and your personal  knowledge of Dr. Bennett, what do you feel is the legacy that he   s left as  an educator, as a statesman?  Well, I think that he certainly made his mark on the university, starting  off with that Twenty-Five Year Plan. I think that set the stage for growth  of the university   college, as it was. I think that he meant to make it the  best that it could possibly be. I think it was better than anybody ever  thought it was because of his efforts. I think that his interest in statewide  politics benefitted the college, because he was very well connected and  obviously the funding for the Twenty-Five Year Plan as well as all of the  other funding came from the state and   well, not all of it. I think that his  connections around the state made a lot of difference in making that  college what it was.  Of course, he started the community college idea. I know in Florida  there are community colleges all over and I think that Granddaddy   s was  22  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  the first that I ever knew where he would establish a small college   well  not college really, but a school   where people could learn trades. People  who might not be qualified to go to college but they certainly were  qualified to learn to make a living and to excel in something. I think that  was important to him.  I   ve heard you say that his approach to international education as Point  Four Director is pretty similar to his land grant philosophy. There   s a  natural outgrowth of his life and in his presidency of a land grant  university in terms of teaching people about how to raise food, about  how to create a better life for themselves. Do you have a sense of how he  felt about that?  I think he felt strongly about that. Obviously that school was designed to  create people who could utilize the land in the best way possible and  also to provide the technical knowledge to make it produce more. I think  that was an underlying philosophy that he had, that we all need that. We  need the food and we need the technical knowledge. Beyond that, I think  though, that he did feel that the liberal arts were important. In other  words, it shouldn   t be just agricultural and mechanical. I think he felt  strongly that people should have at least some exposure to the  knowledge of culture and other aspects   literature and so on.  From your early memories and what you knew later about your  grandfather, President Bennett, what stands out in your mind about him  as a person and as a public figure? What values guided him and  directed him?  I think we   ve already talked about that. I think he certainly had values  and goals and I think that he felt that anybody was capable of achieving  a goal. It might be different for different people but through education,  primarily, I think he felt that people could better themselves and make a  better life for themselves. I think he felt that education was the key to  that. I think he really felt strongly about that.  Did that go back, do you think, to his father, who was an itinerant  Baptist minister, where he grew up in Arkansas and his family roots in  terms of people moving West, in terms of people creating a better life for  themselves? And he saw education as one of those tools to help improve  their condition?  I think so. I don   t know how strongly he was influenced by his parents  but I always had a feeling that his mother was the strength of that family  and she really managed everything. His father was, of course, the  religious person, but I have a feeling that his mother got the food on the  table.  23  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Did you ever hear any stories about his mother?  Not really. I don   t remember him talking about her. But I   ve heard other  things from other people who knew them. I think that she was a pretty  strong woman. And I think that he married a strong woman. You know,  her education was amazing.  Particularly, as you indicated, for that time, to have a Master   s degree.  Yes, University of Chicago. I can   t imagine how she ever figured out  that she wanted to go there.  Do you know how that came about?  I don   t know, I really don   t know.  Was she able to do some of it at a distance or did she actually go to  campus?  They didn   t do stuff on long-distance in that day that I know of so I  would have to think that she went up there. But I never heard any  conversation about that. I really don   t know.  The other thing we talked about, in terms of education being a core  value of Dr. Bennett, was his personal faith one of the values that  carried him, one of his pillars that made him special, do you think?  I think so. I think that was a strength of his and I think he built on it. I  think he was always concerned with doing the right thing. He built his  life around that idea of always doing the right thing.  Another thing that I might ask you about, being around him probably  more than the grandkids, maybe had a chance to know him   I keep  hearing you say a sense of fairness and equality and the way he treated  people. He was the president of a university and an important political  figure in the state and then certainly an international statesman, but  where did that value come from that he felt a connection with the  common man? Was that from his family roots, do you think?  Well, it may have been. I think he was his own person. I don   t think that  anyone in his family had ever achieved at the level that he did. I think he  was a very ambitious person and he believed that he could achieve what  he wanted to; the sky was the limit. I don   t think that he had any feeling  that just being a university president was all he was ever going to do. He  moved beyond that. At a lower level, when he was a teacher, he always  had another goal. I don   t know where that comes from. I think that each  24  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  person is born with an innate sense of himself and some people just have  higher goals than others. I think he had very high goals.  It seems like he never lost touch with the people; he still felt very  comfortable with whatever level he achieved he could relate to people in  all levels of life.  That   s right, yes. He was and anybody was his friend. He didn   t turn his  back on anyone.  Jacqueline, other family members that I visited with share a sense of  specialness about being part of the Bennett family and about the legacy  of Dr. Bennett. Do you share that feeling and why is that so?  I   m very proud to be a part of the family. Unfortunately, I have not lived  here for a long time and so I have not had the opportunity to be close to  other members of my family and close to the university, so I have not  had that special quality of belonging, in a way. But I   ve always been  very proud of it and I think that I   ve always been very proud of my  grandparents.  I think in this perspective, recording your memories and you thoughts,  you and some of your cousins and of course Nancy, your sister, are some  of the last people that really remember in a personal way Dr. Bennett  and Vera. Is there anything else that we want to capture that someone  fifty years from now would want to know if they were looking back trying  to understand who Dr. Henry G. Bennett was? Is there anything you  would want to add that, to comment on?  I really don   t know. He was a very special person and I think that to  describe him as a very ambitious person but very low-key, he definitely  had, as I say, goals to achieve and he achieved a lot of them.  I   d heard stories about his incredible work ethic. He could work into the  wee hours of the morning and still be up at five a.m. maybe on three  hours of sleep. He could still sustain that over a period of time; he had  an incredible sense of energy.  That   s right. Yes, he did. He used to work up in that library at night,  which was just off his bedroom and he would be up there after dinner  most every night. He spoke at so many places around Oklahoma and  beyond, I do remember his always taking off going somewhere. Usually  Tom would drive him or somebody would drive him because he was  always working.  So he could be working on paperwork while Tom would drive the car.  25  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Gill  Holmes  Right, yes. When I was born, my mother was very sick and my father  had strep throat, which was very serious in that day, so they were both in  the hospital when I was born. They didn   t know whether they were  going to live or not. So Granddaddy drove with Phil up there. It was the  dead of winter, December     This was in Baltimore?  Baltimore, yes   Johns Hopkins. There were tales that Phil used to tell  about holding a candle to keep the radiator going. (Laughter) They drove  all night. Might have been embellished somewhat. He needed to be  there, Granddaddy did. It was very important to him.  Did you ever know a time when he wasn   t busy with something? I get the  sense that   I mean, he took time, as you indicated earlier in the  interview, to spend time with the grandkids, but still, he was always  doing something.  No, I don   t think he was ever doing nothing. (Laughs) No, he didn   t  have any hobbies. I can   t ever remember him going on a   I can   t even  think of a trip that we took that didn   t have a purpose; it was something  that he had to do. We went to Chicago one time; I think he was speaking  somewhere. He always had something to do.  Jacqueline, you were, as the oldest grandchild, old enough maybe to  have some conversations with him. Can you recall some of the  conversations you had with him? Some of the things you talked about?  I really don   t. I think that we talked some but I just really can   t think of  anything specific. I know we talked about going to Wellesley and he was  very encouraging because he was very familiar with the school and he  wanted me to go. I don   t know, he always encouraged me to do anything  that I happened to want to do   maybe beyond that.  One little incident I   ll tell you and then I think we   ve got to go. Tom and  Mary decided one summer they would order fireworks and they ordered  a huge amount of them. They kept them in a desk in the basement. Then  somehow, they got that whole desk out of the basement and put it out on  the front lawn and invited all the neighbors and everybody there to see  the fireworks. So they started shooting them off   rockets and all that  stuff. Then a sparkler dropped into a drawer and the whole thing went  off. It was a very spectacular thing. I remember Granddaddy scooping  me up and taking me back to the steps to watch. The fire department  came and all that. That was the big event of that particular summer.  (Laughter)  26  Gill  Holmes  Gill  That   s a great story. Jacqueline, I appreciate very much you taking the  time to visit with me. Is there anything else you want to share before we  close?  I can   t think of anything.  Thank you.  -------  -------
