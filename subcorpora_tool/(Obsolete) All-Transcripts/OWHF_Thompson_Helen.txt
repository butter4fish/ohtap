Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Tuesday, August 16, 2011 and I   m in Ardmore  interviewing Helen Harrod Thompson. This interview is being conducted  as part of the inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame Oral  History Project. Helen was inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall  of Fame in 2011. Thank you for joining us today.  Thank you. I appreciate you being here.  Let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Could you tell us a  little bit about where you grew up and give us some background into  your early life?  I was born in Oklahoma City. Polyclinic Hospital. It   s no longer there. I  think it was on like Tenth Street in Oklahoma City. I grew up on Thirty-fourth  and Walker, which is now the Edgemere Historical District. Went  to Edgemere School. Lived there all my life. Went to Edgemere School,  Harding Junior High. At that time, Harding was a junior high. Then  Northeast High School. Loved it. Loved it all. Of course, at that time we  walked. You know, you walked to school. The schools were like three  blocks, except for Northeast and then we drove to Northeast. But I really  enjoyed school. In thinking about it, I think when I went to Northeast  when I reached high school age. Where we lived was on the dividing  line, so you could go to Classen, Central or Northeast. Of course,  Capitol Hill was way south. There were only four high schools. The  Northeast was a smaller school. The principal happened to live on the  block behind us. My dad determined that   s where we all needed to go. I  had an older sister who was eight years older, so I think she was in one  of the first classes at Northeast High School. My brother was four years  later and he went and of course, baby sister went, too. So, loved it. I  think going to Northeast really was a big change in my life because it  was smaller, and I guess that   s kind of where I got my foothold and  blossomed, interacting with people.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  What were some of your favorite subjects in school?  I was thinking about that. Home ec and choir, I guess. I was in choir.  Took some language. It didn   t take, but I did take French in school. I  liked that. Home ec really was kind of followed through and became  what I majored in when I went to college. So I kind of enjoyed it. One of  the questions it asked  referring to the interview question guide  was  what we did for fun as children. Of course, it   s hard for my children to  realize that we had no TV. There was no TV. You were outside, you  played, you interacted with other kids, which I think we have lost. That   s  been lost today. That   s a shame. But all of our activity was with  neighbor kids. We were always with friends and doing something  outside. In the evening, it was kick the can or something like that.  Riding our bikes. You were always busy. You were outside and  swinging in the backyard, you know, something like that. It was a whole  different deal than it is now. It seems that there was so much more. We  neighbored. We don   t neighbor now. You don   t sit on the porch and talk  to your neighbors. Of course, without air conditioning, we didn   t have  air conditioning. In the evenings, you were always outside on the porch.  Anyway, it was a great time. Great time to grow up.  Tell me a little bit about your parents.  My mom, she was from Tennessee. My dad was from Arkansas. They  were both school teachers and they met in Osceola, Arkansas. He was  the principal and she was one of the teachers. They came in a wagon to  Oklahoma where he went in with his brother into law. He went and  worked his way through the University of Arkansas. Lot of hard work.  Then came to Oklahoma City as an attorney. He was an attorney in  Oklahoma City until, actually, until the day he died. That evening, he  came home and went upstairs to change clothes for the evening and died  of a heart attack. He had a great work ethic. My folks were both very  supportive. My life was my family. Everything, the family was first. If  there was going to be something at the house, you were there. There  were guidelines and yet you didn   t feel like they were real strict, but you  knew you were there. We had dinner every night at 5:30 and you were at  the table. Everyone ate together at dinner. We were all together at  dinner. Breakfast and dinner, really. We had very strong family ties.  Like I said, my dad was an attorney.  My mom had been a teacher, then she went to Randolph Macon and of  course, in that day, that was really something to go away to Virginia.  She was in Tennessee, but education has always been very important in  my family. My dad always said there are two things they can   t take  away from you. One is your name. If you have a good name, they can   t  6  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  take that away from you. The other is education. You   ve got that. That   s  something you need to do for yourself. There was flexibility, but at the  same time, our family was at church every time the door opened. It was  across town in Oklahoma City. I don   t know if you   re familiar with  Oklahoma City, but it was near the old Classen High School building.  Epworth Methodist. Both of my folks were either in the guild women   s  circle, my dad was chairman of the board for years and years. The  church was our deal. We had our pew and the whole thing, and we were  always there. Sometimes, of course,    I don   t want to go,    but as you  look back, it made a difference. I think it really made a difference.  Because I have a thing at home and it says,    There   s two things we can  give our children. One is roots and the other is wings.    They gave me  the roots. It was a little harder for them to give me the wings, but they  did that. (Laughs) So, yeah, I just think that it   s so critical.  How many brothers and sisters did you have?  I have a brother and a sister. My sister was eight years older, my brother  was four years older. My dad figured that out because he said he only  wanted one at the university at the same time. Now of course, he   d be  even more set on that. (Laughs) But he was very systematic in  everything. That was the way it was. So I was the youngest of the  family. We were still very close. My sister is now deceased, but my  brother lives in Edmond and we   re in touch and he   s my rock. I really  count on him for a lot of things.  As you   re growing up and you   re going to school, did you have any idea  of what you wanted to be when you got older?  At that time, women weren   t really looking at professions. I thought  home ec would be nice, but as far as a profession, most women were  secretaries or there weren   t many women in professional jobs. Really,  that was groundbreaking. A wife and a mother, that   s what I wanted to  do. I wanted to have a family and try and replicate what I grew up with.  I think that was    At that time, I don   t think I ever thought about a  career. Then of course when I went to college, I went to Mary Baldwin  my first year. Mary Baldwin is in Stanton, Virginia.  That   s a long way from home.  Yes, long way from home. And I was the first one in our family that had  ever done anything like that. I was a little bit of a rebel as far as I wanted  to go. It wasn   t until later that I realized that probably it was financially  pretty strapped, but I went. Loved it. I was there a year and then went to  OU  University of Oklahoma . Of course, I was just in liberal arts at  Mary Baldwin, basic classes. It was a girl   s school. At that time, every  7  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  school in Virginia was either a boy   s school or a girl   s school. Even the  university was a boy   s school. It was separate. When I was there, I think  I developed a love for travel that I still have. I was close enough, we  went into Washington, D.C., went over to Williamsburg, went to New  York City for a weekend, so I have a real love for travel and I   ve  traveled ever since. But when we went to Mary Baldwin, we went on the  train. We went to St. Louis and it was overnight and then you changed  trains and went over. It was a lot of fun. They had cars set aside for  students going back to school. In Virginia, there were a lot from our part  of the country that went back to school. So they had two  train  cars.  One for boys and one for girls. (Laughs) There was none of this  cohabitation that we have now, but anyway.  Why did you decide to come back to Oklahoma?  I loved it there, it was beautiful country, nice people, but there again,  getting back to family. I thought, I   m going to find someone here and  he   s going to be too far from home and I want to be back home. I think  that was the big thing. The girl I went with, her name was Maryanne  Hine, she was also from Oklahoma City. She wasn   t going back the next  year. After junior high, or in junior high, she and her family moved to  Dallas and we kept in touch. Right before we went to school, she called  me, I guess, in August and said,    Where are you going to school?    I  said,    Well, I   m going to go to OU.    She said,    Well, I   m going to Mary  Baldwin. Why don   t you come down?    So anyway. But she wasn   t  going to be there and plus, I think, the family. That connection. Because  if you   re up there and you   re dating people up there, there   s the  possibility of finding someone there that is so great.  Sure.  So anyway. Came back, went to OU. My sister had been a Delta  Gamma, I was a Delta Gamma at OU. I was in home ec. Of course, they  don   t have a home ec department at OU now. I became a home  demonstration agent.  Did you?  Not an agent, Home Service Consultant is what they called it, worked  for OG+E. We went out into homes. It was in the Home ec line. Foods  were more my thing than clothing. Clothing, it didn   t get done in time. I  didn   t like to do that last putting the hem in and stuff. I want it down  now and move right on down the    (Laughs) I want immediate  results ,  you know. But working as a Home Service Consultant was just great.  We did the demonstrations, went into schools     8  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  What were you demonstrating?  Well, at that time    I sound a hundred, I understand. (Laughter) People  didn   t use electric ranges. Electric ranges were new. Anytime they were  promoting that and the electric company was too, of course. So anytime  someone bought an electric range in town, I would go out to their home  and go over how to use it. That   s what I did. And with my hat and  gloves on because you had to wear a hat and gloves, too. That was part  of the deal. But I was in Shawnee for three years, I guess, as a Home  Service Consultant. Then we went also like to schools to show students,  I   m sure you   ve been to some food demonstrations, but I see them on  TV now and that   s what I did. You had your tray set up before the thing  and you made it look so easy, but you   d spent a day getting all that stuff  together. But anyway, we went in the schools and went to the home ec   classes . Some days, I went all over this area and say, I   d go to Davis.  Go to the school and I might do a demonstration for every class that day  back to back. You   d do  numerous demonstrations . It depended on what  they wanted, but usually it was on the electric range, so we did a full  meal on the electric range, using the oven and the broiler and then it all  comes out at the same time. I did a lot of traveling then.  Lots of driving.  I went to my area. In Shawnee, I had my main office and work in  Shawnee and went out around there, Seminole and Wewoka, all down in  there. And Chandler. But I married. At that time, with OG+E, if you  married, you could only work two more years. See, women weren   t  encouraged to be in professions, really. So you had two years if you  married. Of course, that meant there was quite a turnover in our group.  So when I married, then I moved to Ardmore and they transferred me  down here, but I could just work two years. The woman that was here  had been here and I think felt very threatened by the fact that I came in.  So they ended up giving her Ardmore. I took the towns  outside  Ardmore . I drove to Pauls Valley, Wynnewood, I went to Durant, I  went out as far as Bokchito and sometimes when we went to  Wapanucka, Bowlegs, and they weren   t set up for electric ranges. It  takes 220  volts . I remember, I guess it was    It wasn   t Wapanucka.  Anyway, one of the towns down there. The linemen came out, we got a  range out there, they hauled a range from town, put it in the school. They  didn   t have 220V in this home ec room. They put it on the stage, they  wired it in, 220V from the pole. He stayed there by the pole until I was  through demonstrating and they undid it and took it away. (Laughs) It  was new, so it was really exciting.  Also, when you worked then, you had two years, but if you became  pregnant, you were gone. You didn   t work pregnant. People, I   ve had  9  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  friends that always poo poo-ed women   s lib and I said,    Let me tell you,  you didn   t live it.    For someone that really    I didn   t have to. After you  get married, the man was head of the house. The women didn   t have that  much. They just weren   t thought of as regular workers, like they are  now. Women now don   t realize how far it   s come. Even teachers, and I  think in some cases, that still happens. Where if the man is the head of  the house, he got more. The woman in the next room teaching the same  thing got less. Didn   t mean to get into all that, but. (Laughter) I   m  putting my political hat on.  Tell me how you met your husband.  I met Jack at Lake Murray. Some friends and I had come down from  Shawnee, just down having fun and there was another person from OU  here. That   s where I met him. We dated I guess about a year and a half  and then we married and I moved to Ardmore.  Ardmore is kind of a long way from Oklahoma City.  Yeah, yeah. But it was great, and of course, we divorced then later, but  his family, we all just meshed. His family became my family and my  family became, we all just became very close. So it worked out just  great. Another thing I was thinking about. One of these role models that  you looked up to. Of course, I mentioned my parents, and then there was  a youth minister at our church that was called Pop Porter. I don   t know  what his first name was. He   s gone, of course. An older man. He was  excellent about making everybody feel valuable and really helping you  overcome any insecurities you had. He did a lot for me. But of course,  my folks, they were always there. I thought about also deciding to go  into    It says in here something about what made you decide to go into  home ec?  Sure.  Besides, I loved to cook with my mom. I had an aunt, Aunt Mary. Mary  Dahnke was my mom   s maiden name. She was with Kraft Foods. She  developed cheese as a food. Prior to her going there, they never sold it. It  was just like milk and eggs and cheese. Not telling you what to do with  it or, you know. She worked for Kraft Foods and developed their whole  department of promoting. She wrote their first book, the Kraft cookbook.  A very glamorous life, and she would come down and of course, she  would fly to come see us. All the jewelry and looked wonderful and I  did go up once when I was at Mary Baldwin up to the Kraft place to see  it. She had built their whole promoting it and whenever they did  pictures, they used her hands fixing the food and so forth. But then I  thought later, I was reflecting on that today how glamorous her life  10  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  looked and everything. But how much she really missed as far as family  and what my mom had. At a distance it looks,    Oh, this is fabulous.    But  we had so much more in the long run. But it was kind of glamorous and  I thought, oh, that would be fabulous. That   s kind of the demonstrating  thing. You see that on TV today. All these cooks that are doing the  demonstrating, I thought that looked nice. Fun to do. But anyway.  Did you have any special meals you liked to cook with your mom?  We cooked    I don   t know any particular meal. I was always in the  kitchen. I think, developed pumpkin bread was something I fixed and  gave to people. That was a big deal. I still do that. Mom always did a lot  of canning. I still do. I have her recipe for bread and butter pickles. I do  bread and butter pickles and chow chow and sweet pickles still. In fact,  after she passed away, I brought out her little grinder. That is work. The  grinder is work. (Laughs) I now have an electric one. No, I just enjoyed  when people are very complimentary of something you fix. You fix  something and even now at Christmas, for our friends and so forth, I  cook rather than buy. For family, of course, I buy, but people don   t do  that anymore. They don   t do homemade stuff. So it seems a little more  special than going out and buying something. I still do that.  I take it you had a garden growing up?  We might have had a few things, not much. My dad was raised on a  farm. He said,    As soon as I get away from there, I   m not lifting a hoe  again.    Because he worked the cotton fields. He had a very sparse life.  He was one of those that walked five miles to school. His mother died in  child birth and his dad had died before that. So his older brothers raised  him. His whole ambition was to get out of that. We didn   t do much  gardening. He was an attorney and many people paid him in vegetables  and stuff because at that time, I was born right after Depression times, a  lot of people, that   s how they paid their bills. Every once in a while,  we   d have a couple of chickens in the backyard. We lived in Oklahoma  City, so that was    (Laughs) But I remember driving out sometimes to  collect some of his fees. Like I said, they might pay him in eggs or  something like that. But growing up, also, when I was like maybe eight  or so, nine or ten, it was right during the war. World War II. The forties.  Rationing.  Yeah, rationing. We had rationing, and I remember taking the little  wagon and collecting grease for the war effort. Then you   d take it down  and sell it or give it to them. I just remember my wagon with all these  cans of dirty grease, you know. (Laughs) Then, of course, we had the  rationing of shoes and the whole thing and we all loved it, and we went  11  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  every week. We bought war stamps. We took our pennies to school and  bought stamps and then got a war bond and all that. Those were good  times. It seems like there was more togetherness and people really  caring. I remember walking up Thirty-fourth and Walker. That was three  miles from Main Street, if you went from my house. I remember a friend  of mine, probably we   re in junior high, I don   t think high school, we  would have ridden in a car, but we walked all the way down there on a  Saturday. Walk downtown, go to the movie, and then turn around and  walk home. Didn   t think a thing about it. Now, your kids, you have to  know where they are. It   s unfortunate that we   ve lost some of that, but  that all goes     Different times.  Yes, that   s right.  Well, you were telling me about working for OG+E, moving to Ardmore,  you had two years after you got married to continue your employment     Yes, and then we started raising a family.  Alright, so how many kids did you have?  I have two sons. John and James. John is the oldest and he  graduated  from  OU. They both went to OU. He has five children. He has the  blended family. His and hers and theirs. He has one, twenty-one, at OU  and one that   s four. So he has a handful. James has two girls and one is  at OSU and one is at Plainview. So I try and make  all their activities .  We still do a lot of family  events . I remember my folks, they stressed  the fact,    Always get the family together.    We used to always get  together at Christmas and Thanksgiving. Now, we   re down to  Thanksgiving.  But, that is a    biggie.      But the Oklahoma City family, last year at Lake Murray, I think there  were fifty of us with my group from the city and my daughter-in-law,  Kim, her folks live in Carnegie, so they came over and we were down at  Lake Murray. But it   s still important. This week, we   ll be celebrating   four  birthdays. We always still get together and do the whole thing, the  singing and stuff. Fourth of July, we have a tradition of we meet at my  house at six thirty in the morning and we raise the flag. James, my one  son, I guess he remembered it from high school, recites the preamble to  the Constitution and then we salute the flag. We go out and cook out.  We cook breakfast out. We used to go to the pecan grove out at Lake  Murray and we   ve gone out to Regional Park. We do all the stuff you   re  not supposed to have. Hash browns and gravy and sausage and all that  stuff.  12  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  All that good stuff.  But we   d still do the family. I think we had twenty-five this  year , but  we have some that don   t like to get up, you understand. So they don   t  come to that, but we still try and keep at least those times for family and  get everybody together.  When you were raising your sons, did you work much out of the home?  No, I was home. No, I did not work. After I moved here and quit with  OG+E    In fact, I remember them calling me back when John was  maybe two or something, a toddler, and he called me back to see if I  wanted to come back to work and I said,    No, he just threw his diaper in  the toilet       I was naming some other things he   d done and I said,    I  don   t want to miss one bit of it. I want to be here.    So, no. I didn   t go  back to work until I divorced. That   s a whole different deal.  Take me through your career, post-divorce.  Okay, after divorce?  Yes.  Well, I   m looking here at  the questions . It talks about stumbling blocks  or adversity. Well, I guess I   ve had so much those things become more  challenges to overcome. The Harrods didn   t have stumbling blocks.  (Laughs) Nothing was going to stop us. That was just our kind of  bringing up. You can do it. We don   t do stumbling blocks. So just get  up. So I was going to go back to work. At the time, I was on the school  board. I   d been elected to the school board here. Though my children     I wasn   t sitting at home every minute. I was very active in the school.  I   ve been very active in the Democratic Party, holding  offices , been  county chair and all that. During those times, I was active and so  anyway, I   d been on the school board.  When that happened, I was looking and, well, there are no home service  consultants anymore. They went into the sales department. They  incorporated those women into the sales department to go out and  promote electric cooking. Anyway, I was on the school board and they  had received a grant and the superintendent, Weldon Perrin, who was, in  the educational field, probably my idol. He was fabulous. A real school  person. But anyway, we were talking or he was just talking and he said,     If you would go back there, the whole thrust now is counselors,  elementary counselors. You go back and get your counseling and there  will be a place for you.     13  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Prior to that, they had  only high school counselors . I guess I went back  before that came up. Anyway, I went back to school and I was still at  home. We have the Ardmore Higher Education Center here. I don   t  know if you   re familiar with it, but it   s a consortium. It has classes from  East Central, Southeastern and Murray and you can get your degree  here. They transfer anywhere in the state. Those teachers come to  Ardmore and teach those classes. They have adjunct professors that  come over here, so you can get your degree here. I got my master   s in  counseling and administration without ever going on an East Central  Campus. It   s from East Central, I graduated there.  Was it hard to go back to school later in life?  No. After I got into it, I enjoyed it more. I think I did better because I  needed to be there. I guess I worked harder. At OU, I was just supposed  to be there and go to class. You did this, right? After I went back, I made  much better grades, I concentrated a lot better and I enjoyed it. I really  did. I commuted to Southeastern because they wanted you on campus  for one semester taking classes and that   s where I got my teaching  certificate. With counseling, you have to have a teaching certificate. I  became an elementary counselor and went back with the school district  and was with the school district for twenty-two years. I was an  elementary counselor. Loved that. I went into administration. Went into  community education. I think one of the things I   ve always enjoyed is  kind of seeing a need and developing something for it. We had about   250,000 through my office for programming. That was all grants. I  wasn   t paid  except through grants . My contract always said,    Pending  Funding.    So if I didn   t get the grants, I didn   t get it. It was outreach and  in fact, that   s kind of what I   m still doing.  But at that time, we started the after school program here and called it  Hugs, for children after school .We did the Even Start program, I don   t  know if you   re familiar with that. It   s a federal program. It   s a family  literacy program. You incorporate (which I think is great) the whole  family. The parents have to be taking some class. She might be taking  stuff to get her GED or she might be taking an ESL, English as a Second  Language class. We had English as a Second Language, GED classes,  but the children, the babies are over here. Even Start started at infants to  four and then of course, Head Start picks up at four. This is Even Star,  see. The difference being Even Start, the parents had to be there. They  had to be getting some parenting skills, basic academic skills so they  could get out of there and get a job, which is important, I think. We got  that implemented in the school. I don   t know that we had    All the  driver   s ed came through my office at that time because it was outside  the school day and they had to pay for it. So that   s why it came  through  14  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  my office, the office of Lifelong Learning.   Just like the outreach programs, we    I   m trying to think what the  acronym stood for, but I had a grant through there called SLEAG and it  was    I think about now with all this immigration. It was people that  were here that did not have their green card. If they would go and take  so many hours of English as a Second Language, basically, after a  hundred hours of study, they could go and they could get their red card.  Something like that still needs to be done. I don   t know that that  program is in existence now. But we had an extensive SLEAG program.  It got hard getting their numbers and their names and all that, but we did  a lot of innovative programs through there. But most of them, we had  fifteen GED classes and English as a Second Language. Of course, our  state department is doing away with funding for that. Which I don   t want  to get on that. (Laughs) The people that need it most    I just always felt  like that if they were given a chance, these people don   t want to be down  here. They want to come up. They do want it. If you can help them and  give them some self-confidence and skills, they can make it. I   ve always  felt that, but anyway.  Tell me a little bit about the C/SARA Foundation.  Alright. C/SARA stands for Crisis Support and Resources Association.  C/SARA started out, I guess it   s been over twenty years now. Would be  twenty-one years ago by Dr. Galoob here in town, he and a couple of  educators. His daughter was in a car accident when she was in high  school. Went on the lunch period and had a car accident, fifteen. When  she came back to school, there wasn   t anything in place to handle this  crisis. The kids were to go back to class,    Okay, get back to class.    It  was supposed to be business as usual. As a result of that and watching  kids and how they were grieving and trying to work through this   he  worked with a couple, Donnell Cox and Alan Gilliam at the time were  both in the school system and they developed a program for training, to  go in and train schools how to handle crisis. It can be everything from a  small crisis or a death. So out of his sadness, they built the C/SARA  Foundation. And it was C/SARA, her name was Sara. So it was Crisis  Support and Resources Association. Her name was Sara.  Basically, it started out as training for schools. So they go into schools  and they do a couple of trainings a year with teachers, is what it is. What  you watch for. It isn   t just a suicide, it might be as small as a child   s  animal dying at home or divorce or whatever, you know. Someone now,  of course, someone coming into the school. So there   s a setup of you  look at the crisis and determine what level it is, who is affected. If  someone has come into the school and everyone is threatened, and it   s a  bigger thing than if it   s a child   s dog, and it   s this class, maybe his  15  friends that are affected. So they have different levels. It   s very powerful  training and we did the training and then we would respond like    I  think it was Kingston. Kingston seems to have several    They had a bus  accident. It wasn   t a big bus, it was someone taking the bus back. They  had been driving the bus and the car in front stopped and they plowed  into it. The driver was hurt, the people in the car in front were killed.  They were students. One was high school and one was middle school  and one was elementary. So all those friends are affected. So it   s dealing  with crisis and it   s wonderful.  We also developed a suicide intervention  training that is very powerful.   After I started working for them    I started working out there, I   m  trying to think, in 2000, I guess. At that time, we wanted a place to do  interviews for abused children. We decided we can do this, so we  developed our Child Advocacy Center here in Ardmore. What was just  the C/SARA was just training, now it became the center for interviews,  the center for exams and it serves a five county area. They have   multidisciplinary teams  in each  county . But they refer in or bring the  children in. I drove by there the other day, it   s expanded significantly.  Now they have Donnell Cox, originally he was on the board. Well, he  got off the board and became a trainer. He   s going out. It was hard for  the schools with the financial crises to let their teachers go. They  couldn   t do subs. Just subs was hard to do money-wise. So he   s doing  the training.  I was there five years. I felt like we really made progress. We got the  Child Advocacy Center in place and we were very active in the state  organization. Sissy Burge that   s there now, she worked under me and  when I hired her, I said,    I   m not going to be here for that long.    I   ve  always felt that if I could help someone that   s working with me that they  could move up, and she   s director now. But, I think I   d gone out, I was  at a football game at Plainview watching my granddaughter cheer and  someone came over and said we need to go to Dickson School. There  was a cheerleader, she was going to the game and had a wreck. I went  out that night and was back out there the next morning at seven. I said, I  think I   m through now, I can   t do this any longer.  It   s tough. It is tough stuff. And abused children, I mean    I didn   t do  the interviews. We had someone do the interviews. They came in and  we   re there. We   re setting them up and helping them and talking to  parents and we had it set up like a playroom. They came in and   non-threatening  site. We called it Sara   s House. So instead of saying,    We   re  going to child advocacy  center ,       We   re going to Sara   s House. I   m  going to go over to Sara   s House,    you know,    Time to do the  interview.    It   s tough. It   s tough duty. Just seeing it and I just, after that  last one, I thought, someone else is going to have to handle some of this  16  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  crisis. It   s hard and it just begins to take over your whole psyche. Like  our DHS childcare workers in the children   s division. Their burnout is  like two years. That   s all they see. You know, I see articles about, they  do everything they can do. The system doesn   t stick in there for them.  To get them out. They can   t remove children from the home. DHS can   t.  It takes the police. Most people don   t realize that. They can recommend  it, but they recommend it to the police, if they don   t do it, they can   t do  anything about it.  After C/SARA, you went on to Ardmore Higher Education.  I   m at Higher Ed now.  Tell me about Senior University.  Oh, okay. Well, after I thought, well I   m going to retire, I   m at the age I  can retire    After about a year, year and a half, I   m trying to think. I  guess it was about a year. I was doing different things and enjoying my  friends and playing bridge, but I need more than that. A reason to get up,  I think. So there was an ad in the paper about    I had looked at different  things around town. This was for part-time. It was called program  coordinator for continuing ed. That   s what I did. That   s what I did with  the schools and loved it. Setting up programs and it was going to be part-time.  I   d looked at other jobs and I thought, getting up at eight-to-five? I  think I   ve been there. Don   t want to do that. This worked out perfect for  me. I   m very supportive of Higher Ed. This was a job initially, come in  at one and stay until nine on Monday and Tuesday. Because they needed  someone there, an administrator at night. And I   m an administrator.  The other gal working there is retired and she is from Vo Tech,  Georganne Westfall. I knew Georganne and so she   s there Wednesday,  Thursday. So that worked. We could exchange and it worked out good.  When I was interviewed, he said,    What I   d like to do is start a program  out here for people fifty-five and older.    Okay, so we messed around  with that and I started looking at different things to offer, and I   d done  that kind of thing before. I   d set up programs. Then, the more we looked,  the more I got into it. I thought, what we need to do is network with the  other agencies (I   d networked with them for years) and coordinate  programming. So I can do advertising, we can use, like at the Y, one of  the first things we did, we called it Walk the Walk. One of the trainers at  the Y would come out three mornings a week and we   d meet her and  we   d walk. We had  walks out there at AHEC, there were walks around  the campus. We   d walk  for an hour and just exercise. I was trying to  promote exercise, so I found out all of the places in town  that offered  classes for them. We walked around the Higher Ed and Ardmore Higher  Ed complex.   17  As we developed it, we decided to call it Senior University. We sent out  surveys and  several  have coordinated with us, we have the Y, we have  the hospital, we   ve done tours there at the hospital. They   ve come out  and done classes. They had a heart specialist come out and do a heart  class, we had one on diabetes    We had different classes. I found out  our people, they don   t want to hear about being sick. They want to have  fun. Then I coordinated with the Village, which is a retirement center  here. With Main Street, Ardmore Main Street, we   ve taken some trips  down there with the merchants and gotten the trolley through Ardmore.  We had eleven different agencies that we were coordinating with, of  course, Ardmore Schools, Chickasaw Nation, the Chickasaw Nutrition  Center. The Goddard Center. The Goddard Center is our cultural center  here. Fabulous. They would set up some classes, special pottery class for  Senior University.  I would advertise. I send on my email   I have maybe 150. That   s not a  lot, but we   d do that and we have about 350 on our mailing list. The  other day, the Goddard is having Two-Hawks. John Two-Hawks. He   s  an Indian flautist. You call him a flautist? Not a flutist, a flautist.  (Laughter) Anyway, he   s going to be here. I just did a little flyer and  sent it out for the Goddard. I   m telling them about this. I usually put     Senior University Supports       and then put this down here. So that  they know what   s going on in town, the seniors do. We   ve done an  Eagle watch tour  at Sulphur at the park .  I coordinated with our church because they were starting a senior  program and I needed buses, so I   m coordinating with them and I   m on  that committee down there to help. They have a group called SAM,  Senior Adult Ministry. So I   m working with them to help publicize and  like I say, we can use the buses. They pay for them, we pay    But we  don   t have any transportation. It   s worked out great. We were  recognized at the state two years ago, I guess, for our innovative  program and then we got national recognition. I guess it was a year ago  that we went to Philadelphia and received  the Innovative Program  Award . Dr. Mills, who is over our center, we went up there. So that   s  nice.  That   s really nice to be recognized. If you put it together and so that   s  the challenge for me is to try to,    Let   s get it going.    You know, see if  we can do it. Dr. Mills said, if he   s talking about it in a presentation,  he   ll say,    What started out as something to fill some of our time  during  down time , rooms that we didn   t have anything in, has become an  umbrella for the whole community of things for seniors.    I   ll advertise  things like if it   s here or if it   s at Chickasaw Library, I can send that out  or incorporate it in my flyer or whatever. So it   s worked well and I   m  18  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  loving it. I   m loving it. I guess just the challenge of seeing if you can do  it and getting it together is fun for me.  Well don   t tell this woman that she can   t do something. (Laughter)  No. But, yeah. When I was with the school district, and I loved the  counseling and all, when I went into administration, I missed the kids.  Because that was right after our divorce, and I go back in as a counselor.  They just make you feel wonderful. I really loved that elementary  counseling. They   re cutting back on that now. It   s so critical. The kids  that are coming to school and they   re talking about how can they think  about learning when they haven   t had something to eat or    You know.  Anyway. I went in the classroom every day. We had a schedule with the  elementary and I took something in every day, whether it was self-esteem  or drugs, or I don   t know. We had small groups and we did a  great job. We loved it. I was really active in the politics. In the school  committees, not just committee, but I was president of the group here.  Ended up going to    Chosen to go to the NEA convention and then we  had the National Democratic Convention because of my teacher part.  I   m an educator person and I   m very disappointed with our  superintendent. (Laughs) I   ll just throw that in. They don   t have to tell  that. It   s so critical that we provide things for those most in need.  So they don   t fall through the cracks.  That   s right. That   s right. Because just a little bit can make a big  difference.  Well we mentioned that you went back to school for your master   s  degree, your teaching certificate, but we learned the background we  need for our careers in many different places, not always in the  classroom. Where do you think you learned the background you needed  to do the work you did and continue to do?  It was my church and my home because like I said, the Harrods, there  wasn   t anything we couldn   t do. (Laughs) We were brought up that if it  was a challenge, you just go after it and you do it. You can do it. Also, in  the church and being able   of course, not just the spiritual  encouragement, but also the people that believed in you and encouraged   you . And given the opportunity to do things. Junior high, maybe junior  high, when they were just doing programs. You were never allowed or  called on to do a program. All of a sudden, they think you can do it and  you do it. And you realize, yeah, and then you want to do it again. I  think there is just a lot of just giving people a chance. If they don   t,  many times people are just nice and let the others do it when they  haven   t been asked or encouraged.  19  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  I would credit really my church and home. My parents were leaders.  They were    in charge    people. They got things done and promoted and  were both of them in their different organizations. They were leaders in  those organizations. Cared a lot about people. I remember my dad, when  they were first starting the children   s home in Tahlequah. That was  through the Methodist church and I can remember him going up and  frying fish for all the kids and then bringing some of them home and  then buying  them things . Because they didn   t have suitcases, he   d get  them a suitcase to carry their stuff in. It was just a good model to see that  he would do that. You take care of other people. On the way, you kind  of bring other people along with you. Still, the Methodist church now  has several missions within the church, you know, different homes.  But when I give mine, I designate it for Tahlequah because it was just  special. Because we grew up    Then my mom always, she reached out  in the community and helping people. I remember her going out working  with women and they were the church people, also, in the black  community. When many people would not go over and work with them,  she would. My mom grew up in Tennessee, which is southern. I mean  southern. (Laughs) I saw The Help the other night and she grew up that  way. She still cared had a real caring attitude, taking care of people.  You mentioned that with Harrods, there is no adversity. On the flip side,  tell me about key moments that you consider some of your biggest  highlights.  Biggest highlights. (Laughs)  Biggest highlights as you look back.  Gosh, I don   t know. You   re talking about in my career? Well, I think  being recognized by your cohorts. Being chosen to be    I was on the  NEA, National Resolutions Committee, and I was chosen by the state.  That   s quite an honor. There are a lot of educators. I think anytime you  are chosen for something. When I went to the National Democratic  Convention. Of course, that was a highlight for me because being the  Democrat that I am, that was very big. At that time, the NEA  convention, and then the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame. What can  top that?  Speaking about the Hall of Fame, when you were notified that you were  going to be inducted, what was going through your mind?  (Laughs) I couldn   t believe it really. I thought of all these other people,  and a lot of people in Ardmore. There are a lot of people that have done  20  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  so much and a lot of people do so much behind the scenes and aren   t  recognized, which is a shame. They make it happen. I thought about  that. I didn   t know if it was for real because you probably weren   t at the  induction? You weren   t at the induction at the Hall of Fame, were you?  I was.  Oh, okay. As I said then, when they called    They called on a Friday  night. Friday night, someone calls and says you   ve been  chosen . I said,     Oh, yeah     I was excited and I thought, is this for real? I knew I   d been  nominated, see, I knew because you had to get all that stuff together and  help get it together. I knew I   d been nominated, but I thought, no. So I  waited until Monday and I called. I said,    I just wanted    I got a call, I  just wanted to check.    (Laughs)  Did you tell anybody?  No  I didn   t tell anyone   (Laughs)  Well, I didn   t know  No, I didn   t tell anybody and I waited until  Monday. I was really blown away and it   s quite an honor. I feel very  honored.  Well, at the ceremony, do you remember who presented you?  Crutchfield from here. Johnny Crutchfield, who is a senator and we   d  worked    He used to be in the school system before he became senator  and then I worked for him, promoting him as senator. Then he was up  there and we worked together a lot. So I was delighted to have him as  my presenter. Speaking of family, I had twenty-three  family members  present . I said,    How do we get tickets?    or something.    Well, we   ll be  sending some out.    Okay. She said there   d be about twenty and I said,     Okay, that will cover my family.    Who else? (Laughs) I   ve got the  people who wrote letters, John Earl Thompson, I   m on the Children   s  Shelter Board, board of directors and he   s our director. He   d also been  with the school system and so we go way back. We refer to each other as  cousins. He   s black, and a wonderful friend. But anyway, I said,    I   ve  got to have these people there.    It was    We had the one presenter and  Johnny did a good job. His wife was there, too.  What does this type of honor mean to you?  You know, I was thinking about that. I   m looking here. I think it   s a  challenge to maybe live up to. It   s a heavy thing to say you   re in the Hall  21  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  of Fame. You want to continue to earn it or people to continue to say,     Yeah, she really did deserve that.    Like I say, there   s so many people.  When I look at the people that went in with me, I thought, how did I get  on here? It   s an awesome experience to think that you, in the state, that  you   d been chosen. Nice, yeah.  How do you feel that now people look at you as that role model? And  I   m sure they have even before this.  No  I don   t know. I don   t know if I am    I just hope I can live up to it.  That   s all. Like I said, there   s a lot of other people and the only time I   ve  had someone say something about a role model, this one gal that in fact,  I   d hired her and she   s coming to help with our grand-families  conference. Another supervisor, I mean, Dr. Mills said    We   d been to  OU to a conference up there, continuing ed conference, and we were in  different rooms. He said,    I want you to check on this.    It was grand-families.  G-R-A-N-D families. And it   s grandparents that are raising  their grandchildren. He is raising his grandchildren. He and his wife got  their grandchildren, one was six months and one was two. That   s starting  over. They   re in their sixties. So it   s been about two years. But this will  be our second grand-families conference this fall.  We   re bringing a lot of resources and we have a couple of speakers from  Oklahoma City. After our last conference and evaluations, one of them  said,    What   s the best thing about the conference?    And they said,    I  found out I   m not alone.    That   s pretty powerful if you can have an  impact. Like, no you   re not, look at all these people  I won   t get into  that. You probably saw the statistics on that. Oklahoma is top in the  nation on grandparents raising grandchildren. 8.7 percent of our  families. I asked him. I said,    Why haven   t I heard that?    Because I  started looking into it. A lot of my associates, people I   m working with  out in the community, they   re raising grandchildren. I said,    Why didn   t  I know of it?    He said,    It   s an admission you didn   t do a very good job.  And so they don   t talk about it.    I said,    Well, I think it   s an admission  that you stepped up to the plate when you had to. I think it   s fabulous.     I didn   t mean to get off on that, except I do have one of the gals that  worked for me when I was with the school district is now a counselor.  She went and got her counseling and she is going to do    She works  with families and children, kids, and she   s going to do a section on  bullying. Of course, that   s critical. The things we   re talking about aren   t  just for grandparents, they   re for everyone. Last year they did a section  on sexting and that   s a major problem. The kids get talked into it and  then it   s all over. But anyway. I got off. Kristy said that she had said,     You know, you   re my role model.    And I thought, gosh, you know.  When someone says something like that, you just hope you can live up  22  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  to it. That you can do    I   m not talking about as a professional, but as a  person.  It   s so important how you treat other people. If you   re there, you   ve got  to be careful how you act and how you treat people. So it   s hard to be a  role model. I can hardly talk about it. My daughter-in-law said,    I guess  you know, you   re the girls    role model.    I said,    Oh, dear. Don   t put that  on me     (Laughter) But you know, she said,    No the fact that you go  ahead and you can do and you take charge of things.    I don   t think it   s  much as maybe accomplishments as that I can keep on keeping on and  do things. I don   t know. I   m going to try and be good, though.  Well, you   re still very much involved in the Ardmore community. What  are some of the boards and organizations that you continue to serve on?  Well, I   m on the Children   s Shelter Board. I   m no longer on the museum  board, the Greater Southwest Museum, but I   m on their endowment  committee, so I   m still involved with the museum. I   m trying to think  what others. The church, I   m Stephen minister at our church. Do that  piece. What was it, there was something the other day that we were  doing. I   m trying to do a little more at the church. I used to be, way back  when my children were younger, I was really involved at the church  with Sunday school and all that. I was director at one time of the  children   s division and would like to get back doing more of that. Right  now, I   m on SAM, which is Senior Adult Ministry, at the church and  involved in that. It seemed like there were some other organizations, but  right now I think those are my main affiliations.  It seems like retirement is not in your vocabulary.  (Laughs) No. No. I think you   ve just got to keep on. I try and encourage  people my age. I think you have to keep moving because I see people  that are quite a bit younger than I am that are old. They don   t get out and  they don   t feel like getting out and you have to fight it. You have to keep  moving and stay involved. I was thinking, coming down here, I   ve been  on the Literacy Council before here. I   m presently not on that and I   m  still a member of the Carter County Democratic Women and the Retired  Teachers Association. I   ve got different things like that, but I am not  leading those organizations at this point, which I have in the past. All of  them need younger people to move in there and get more involved. I   ve  been pretty involved in the Goddard Center. I   m not on the board there  or anything, but I am working closely with them with this Senior  University. I   ve tried, through Senior University, we have a yoga class at  the Y, so I do that three days a week. In fact, I went to yoga this morning  and had to go get cleaned up afterwards. And then do exercise, walk my  dog every morning. So aside from that, I   m not     23  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Got to keep busy.  Yes, keep busy.  You mentioned your parents and some other folks, would you like to say  anything about the people who have helped you through the years? Too  many to name?  Yeah, well, a lot. As you go through    I was looking at that, I  mentioned Weldon Perrin in the education system. Weldon was very  powerful, and the different ministers. Of course, as you work in different  organizations, it makes all the difference to have good support of people  that are there. Of course, there   s Rayvone Thompson. She   s on my  committee. She   s on this grand-families committee. Her husband is the  one that is over the children   s shelter. She   s a teacher in the Ardmore  schools. People like that, like Rayvone, John Earl Thompson, Emmet  Hudgens and the people in the school system that gave me so much  support. A gal named Pat Sperry that isn   t the counselor anymore, but  she was when I started elementary counseling, she was there.  Then like I say, family and my sons both were a great support. When  you go back to school, all of a sudden, they were both in school. When I  divorced, James was in junior high and John was in high school. So,  they were very supportive and both were at my graduation, there.  (Laughs) But other people, like I say, Pop Porter, I don   t know why his  name came up, and then my folks, they   ve always been there. They   re  always there when you win or lose. They   re there to give you support  and it makes all the difference. And you   re going to have me crying here  in a minute, aren   t you? (Laughs) No  My sister, she went to OU. She  was the first woman cheerleader at OU in the forties. It was during the  war. So she was one of the first woman cheerleaders at OU. My brother  was a district attorney in Oklahoma County. So the family has been very  involved and supportive of one another. But like you said, there are too  many to thank. When I was trying to think of people just to come to  Oklahoma City, that was so hard because I had family that was going to  be there.  Others that had meant a lot just along the way. Today and now of  course, this program out there, Dr. Mills, Steve, I worked with him when  he was at Vo Tech. We were both just working. He wasn   t over me then,  but he   s been very supportive, just in this job. I started out Tuesday and  Thursday going from one to nine. Right after the first of the year,  another administrator in town had retired and was kind of looking, so he  told me, he said,    What I want you to do is do Senior University. You  can come anytime you want to, come and go whenever you want to.  24  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  We   ll pay you half time, just standard.    They just went and took last  year and figured what I made and divided it over twelve months just to  implement that program. I still go out on Monday and Tuesday  afternoons because I need some scheduling and some parameters. But  he   s given me a lot and he believes in me. That   s important that  someone thinks you can do that. You   re going to be more if someone  treats you that way, you   re going to even do a better job because you  want to show them that they were right. (Laughs)  If you could give advice to your fellow Oklahomans, what would you tell  them?  (Laughs) What would I tell them? Well, like I say, there are no  obstacles, there are just opportunities. Just give the best that you have.  I   ve always said, regardless of the job, do the best you can. I think it is  important to take time for each person that you meet during the day.  Whether it   s the custodian, secretary or the cook at the schools. The  cooks were the ones that knew all the kids. Take time for people. Give a  hand to people on the way up. As you   re building, help someone else  along the way. I tried both at C/SARA and when I left the school  district, the gals that were under me, one of my friends said,    You know,  you gave her that job.    I said,    I know, I   m so proud of that.    Give them  an opportunity to develop their capabilities. I think if you can help  people along the way, it makes all the difference. I think in Oklahoma  we should be proud to be Oklahomans and we should stand high because  we   re a special people. I think we are, and home and family are so dear  to Oklahomans. And I just think in order to succeed, that needs to be  first. You   re going to have me  crying . Okay  (Laughter)  For those who plan to follow in your footsteps of seeing needs in their  communities, and helping to fill these gaps, do you have advice for  people who aspire to do the same work you did?  Well, I think there are a lot of things out there. There are a lot of things  that I see that I think, oh, I   d sure like to do that. I don   t have time. I  can   t do that right now. It   s just unlimited, the opportunities there are to  help in your community. Take a little time and look around, whether it   s  like they   re doing in the city, those lunches for kids on the weekend.  What a wonderful thing to be doing. Whether it   s setting up a program  to read with children after school or something like that. I just think,  watch for opportunities, there   s something there. Talk to people about  what    If we could have whatever we want to in the community, just  ask. They   ll tell you what   s needed. That   s how we really started with  our afterschool programs and of course now, they   re all over the nation.  Ours, they were started at that time, but there was a time when all of a  25  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  sudden, there was a critical need for that and there hadn   t been in the  past because the parents were home. As we have flex times, I think  people in business   you remember the show 9 to 5? I think people in  business need to look at ways to help those employees, whether it   s with  childcare or a time for exercise, health. I   m working with the higher ed  to have one day a week when all the staff exercises together. I   ve talked  to them at the Y and they   ve got it set up. We   re going to go on Fridays  for a month and kind of see how it goes. There are a lot of opportunities,  just be open. At first, someone might say,    Oh, you can   t do that.    Well  then just kind of step back and go in at a different angle. Look for  opportunities and things, challenges. Always look for challenges.  Well, what does Oklahoma mean to you?  (Laughs) This is my place. Like I say, I think Oklahoma represents a  people of varied backgrounds, with our Indian culture, that have come  together and worked together. I just think Oklahoma is a place where  people care. They care about one another and they   ll go the extra mile  for one another. I hope we can continue to do that and not become  divisive. Whether it   s in our cultural    We need to work together. One  of the committees I   ve been on is the CPASA, Citizens to Protect the  Arbuckle-Simpson Aquifer, that   s a real challenge for Oklahoma  because we want to protect our water down here and somebody across  the state doesn   t have any. That   s a challenge. But surely we can come  together and figure that out and look out for each other. Oklahoma, I  think, represents a state of caring. I think that was very evident during  the bombing. That we came together and together we can do anything.  We   ve got the background, we   ve got the roots, we have religious  background, we have family. I think those things have always been  cherished in our culture in Oklahoma. It might be a little different than  other places, but I think family and our roots just mean a lot to us. I  think we need to cherish that.  Before I ask my last question, is there anything else you would like to  add that I haven   t asked you about today?  (Laughs) I don   t know  Let me think. Of course, I mentioned family.  That needs to be stressed more and more. Whether it   s events to get  families together or have more opportunities for the whole family. My  family didn   t travel without family. We all went together. We went to  some camps, I think I went to Campfire camp. My brother went to Boy  Scouts, that kind of thing, but when we took a trip, it was all together. I  think we could develop our state with that same idea into one big family  that cares about each other and takes care of each other.  There   s so many things now that concern me, that are bitter issues where  26  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  Nykolaiszyn  Thompson  people are not necessarily nationwide, kind of targeting each other,  picking at each other, undermining each other. I think we have to turn  that around and start building together and building each other up. I  don   t understand that. I   ve never understood that. Of course, I don   t  understand gossip. It   s so destructive. At the same time, as a result, I  don   t hear much gossip because I   m not going to say anything. (Laughs)  I   m not going to add to it. But anyway. No, I think family is it. We are  one large family. Even the United States, and we just need to work that  way together, red and blue states.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  I just think that I would like for history to say that she cared. Whether  it   s whatever    It just all gets down to caring about one another and  helping lift each other up. I think it   s critical that we get back to caring.  If I   m known as someone that cared, that   s going to be fine.  Well I think that speaks worlds to the work you   ve done here in Ardmore  and continue to do.  Well, thank you.  I appreciate your time today.  Well, thank you. Thank you.  -------  -------
