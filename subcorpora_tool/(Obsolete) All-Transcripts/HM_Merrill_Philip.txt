Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Philip Jackson Merrill [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill], P-H-I-L-I-P, J-A-C-K-S-O-N, M-E-R-R-I-L-L.
Speaker 1: And, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is 03/14/1962 [March 14, 1962], Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Historian, author, lecturer, museum consultant, jack of many trades (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're the founder of--
Speaker 2: I'm the founder of Nanny Jack and Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Here in Baltimore, right?
Speaker 2: Based in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is August 7, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are located in Baltimore, Maryland, in my home at 5005 Edmondson Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland.
Story_ID: 661445
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions that we always ask that are kind of like a warm up, and they only require a short answer.  First one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Yes, I do.  My favorite food would be macaroni and cheese.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite color?  Yes, blue would be that favorite color.
Speaker 1: All right.  Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year would be the beginning of spring or maybe summer solstice but the warm time of the season.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, no favorite vacation destination just as long as the weather is nice.
Speaker 1: All right.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase would be, it's open to interpretation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I have to stop on that one just to ask you for some, you know, would you expound on that one a little bit because of your--
Speaker 2: I do a lot of appraising of artifacts and as an appraiser, it is open to interpretation.  Six other people can look at it and see six different things and put a different value on it.  So I transfer that to when you are talking to someone, whether it be about a political or religious or just obesity or the Trayvon Martin situation, things are--it's open for interpretation, which leads to a different discussion.  So there is no right or wrong answer.
Story_ID: 661446
Speaker 1: So I'm going to ask about your family history now.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we'll start with your mother's side and we'll, then we'll put them both together after we do both sides separate.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Betty Louise Merrill [Betty Jackson Merrill], B-E-T-T-Y, L-O-U-I-S-E, M-E-R-R-I-L-L.
Speaker 1: And what is her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maiden name Jackson--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --hence my middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hence Nanny Jack [Nanny Jack and Company, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: All right.  What is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: Date of birth is February 20, 1943.
Speaker 2: And where was she born?
Speaker 1: Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 1: On my maternal side I can go back to the early 1850s.  I start off with obviously my mother, Betty.  I then go to her mother, Mary Frances [Mary Jackson Fleming] who is in her late eighties, civil rights activist in New York.  I then go to Nanny Jack, the name of our company. That was the nickname for my great-grandmother, Gertrude Jackson [Gertrude Berry Jackson].  Her mother's name was Peachie [Peachie Berry Baltimore] and Peachie's mother's name was Jennie [Jennie Berry].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you can go back to your great-great-great--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --grandmother.
Speaker 1: I've physically walked in the footsteps of them in what is now known as Jefferson County in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not far from Harpers Ferry [West Virginia].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Right, right that's where--Char- Charles Town's [West Virginia] the county seat.
Speaker 1: Exactly, indeed, indeed.  I was very excited to be in that area (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, that's the area where Martin Delany was born.
Speaker 1: Yes, indeed (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So then, so Jennie goes all the way back to there.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Are there any stories from--that were passed down from your great-great-great-grandmother?
Speaker 1: Not only are there stories passed down from Nanny Jack but I was fortunate to be blessed to walk into the library, talk to a knowledgeable person that was so excited about my genealogical quest that she picked up the phone, called someone that then led me to the family that my great-grandmother, Nanny Jack, used to sleep as a child on pallets in their bedroom floor, on their bedroom floor.  So I went to meet them and they could share stories about my maternal great-grandmother and the likes.  It was a very powerful moment in a lily white retirement community.  I marched in there proudly with the desire to learn more about my ancestors.
Speaker 2: Were there any, any stories that surprised you or any good stories from that experience?
Speaker 1: The stories didn't surprise me.  The--well, I--the one story that did surprise was I was sad that the artifacts connected to my family were all sold off down there.  So the white family, the Snyder [ph.] family that they were sharecropping with at the time were very sorry that I hadn't come along sooner with my quest to research, so maybe I could have been able to acquire some pieces of furniture and the like that were owned by my relatives.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They talked about the personality, the high spiritedness of my great-grandmother, Gertrude.  They talked about her--even as a young person the attitude of taking no prisoners.  She was a very determined person that (laughter) to quote Malcolm X, "By any means necessary," she was going to find a way to get things done.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So her family--now she was--would she have been born right after slavery or (mumbles)--
Speaker 1: No, Gertrude--now keep in, keep in mind that's my great-grandmother, Nanny Jack.  Her mother was Peachie, the one that--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So Jennie (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Jennie, yes.  Jennie was a slave.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And according to some hearsay from white folks there might be some connection to [President] George Washington's family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--Charles Washington actually was--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --was, what do they call it, Happy Retreat [Charles Town, West Virginia]?  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Larry [Larry Crowe], you're something else (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's--well, I've just done a lot of focus on Delany so I remember that--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sure, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that--
Speaker 1: I actually have one picture that's not available today of Jennie.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I have to say that I started this project when I was a young lad.  'Roots' did a whole lot for me.  When the show appeared with Alex Haley in the late '70s [1970s] it just opened up the floodgates for me and millions of others and at that point, Nanny Jack was still alive, so I started interviewing her and other relatives and unfortunately, I stopped, and the rest is history.
Story_ID: 661447
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that area was, that was dominated by the Washingtons.  All of the--[President] George Washington's brothers and sisters lived around there at some point.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Except for him, (mumbles) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, which is kind of curious.  Oh, I do have one other story that I think you might like.  Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson] married Philip Martin Jackson [Philip Jackson] and they say they met by railroad tracks so I was trying to compose some type of little ditty about Nanny Jack and Fiddling Phil met by the railroad track and blah, blah, blah, blah.  He was some type of guitar, banjo, minstrel type per- performer and she married him to just get away from the environment in West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Did not have a happy, successful or easy marriage whatsoever.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then does Philip Martin Jackson soon take her to Baltimore [Maryland] or--
Speaker 2: Yes, they moved out to what is known as colored Towson [Maryland] not far from Towson University.  There is a black enclave out there that is historic today.
Speaker 1: Colored Towson.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: T-O-W-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: All right.  And they--okay.  So they--was this where Peachie [Merrill's maternal great-great-grandmother, Peachie Berry Baltimore] lived as well?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, Peachie never made it to Baltimore.  Peachie died young, died young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So her mother outlived her (mumbles)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and actually Jennie [Merrill's maternal great-great-great-grandmother, Jennie Berry] played a big, a big role in helping to raise Nanny Jack.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did Peachie pass down a story?  I know this is really stretching here but it's possible.  Did she pass down any stories about the trial of John Brown?
Speaker 2: No, I never--unfortunately at the time (laughter) and of course years later I wished I could go back and ask them different questions, ask Nanny Jack and others different questions, but we can't.  That was not even in my scope of--at the time about, anything about John Brown.
Speaker 1: You would have been in high school [Friends School, Baltimore, Maryland], right--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --when 'Roots' (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, I was, I was but in college [Loyola College in Maryland; Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland], I began to pick it up again.  So I've picked it up, I've stopped, I've picked it up, I've hit brick walls and stopped and so forth.  So each time when I do renew my effort I have a new sense of research methodology with technology changing and records being accessible and just a better scholar at the game, so to speak.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what kind of work did Nanny Jack do in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Domestic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She even worked in Towson for a funeral home where she would dress the dead bodies and take care of the hair.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm always proud to say that even during the most difficult time she never went on welfare.  Was able to earn an honest living, raised several children and become a pillar of strength and a noted person in historic old West Baltimore known as Sandtown [Sandtown-Winchester] which is a part of a national historic district today.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit of the history of Sandtown because I know you can (laughter).
Speaker 2: Sandtown really interestingly enough in this 175 block district that is designa- was designated roughly in 2004. Sandtown has the least most exciting history, and it really should not have been grouped--four or five neighborhoods are all created under one, this one umbrella grouping.  They are all distinctively different in their demographics with the significance of buildings, of people that lived there, worked there, played there and who visited there.  It really is a disservice to the African American experience that they were all grouped under the one larger umbrella. Sandtown today is a shell of what it used to be because of Habitat for the Humanity and so much demolition and neglect and just the changing demographics.  It's a, it's a mere shell of what I remember from the '60s [1960s] as a little boy because that's where I spent the first six years of my life.  Within blocks of historic Pennsylvania Avenue which Nanny Jack and I would walk to, frequently to the Lafayette Market [Avenue Market, Baltimore, Maryland].  So, you know, my stomping ground is the most significant black district in the country because it is alleged the largest in the country with 175 blocks--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) which is pretty remarkable.
Speaker 1: That's West Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Old West Baltimore [Old West Baltimore Historic District, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Old West Baltimore (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) OWB (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Old West Baltimore, yes.
Story_ID: 661448
Speaker 1: Now what kind of stories, and I know she told you some stories, but what stories did Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson] tell you about growing up and about, about her work even in the city?
Speaker 2: One of my favorite stories that she would relay to us is that one time there was a domestic dispute with Fiddling Jackson [Merrill's maternal great-grandfather, Philip Jackson] (laughter), and the police arrived, and the police said, "If you don't do what I want I'm going to take you to jail."
Speaker 1: To?
Speaker 2: Us.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: To--
Speaker 2: To Nanny Jack.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So since Nanny Jack was of sound mind and determined body she said, "I will not sleep with you, so therefore you need to arrest me," and she spent the night in jail.  Powerful story of sticking to her guns.  Then there are countless other stories where basically in Sandtown [Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore, Maryland] she ran the safe house.  (Laughter) You could come to 1307 North Stockton Street for food, for money, for prayer, for consultation, a place to lay your head, a place to get your butt kicked (laughter), and it was like everybody knew this was the place you could go.  If you were--needed to hide out from somebody, so she was respected in the community but at the same time, they knew that she didn't play and that even though she was short in physical height, her appearance was she may have not been 4'8" but everybody thought that she was 6'4" because of her mouth and her ability to stand up on something and then hit you.  So she really was a tough person but a highly respected person with a fourth grade education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But again could read and write, could do any and everything.
Speaker 1: Now this is--what you just described as the safe house concept, this is something that people are coming up with now for women who are abused and that sort of thing.  But this is a safe house for, could be for children or poor people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For the black community.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: For people that were in need of something.  You know, in the back there was, there was a mini farm, there was a chicken house, and I can remember the little boy being very afraid of when she would wring the necks of the chicken, chickens in the backyard.  And keep in mind this is in, this is in the city so, you know, she carried some of that West Virginia experiences to historic Sandtown in Old West Baltimore [Old West Baltimore Historic District, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So those, so, all right.  So any other stories about Nanny Jack?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure I have, I have, I have enough stories to fill up.  I'm just trying to give you some selected stories.  One story that I'm almost ashamed to say but I, but I'm going to say it anyway.  Keep in mind the proximity of Pennsylvania Avenue was in walking distance and Pennsylvania is a main street.  It's a, it's a black mecca similar to Lenox [Lenox Avenue; Malcolm X Boulevard] in Harlem [New York, New York] and so forth.  And Nanny Jack was out hanging one night and she was singing and she was coming home, you know, loud and probably raucous so to speak and somebody yelled out the window, "Please, stop singing because So and So is sick and not feeling well," so then she yelled back up, "And go on and tell that person to die then," (laughter).  So I know that's, I know that's not a story--she's going to hit me for saying that but that's showing the essence of her personality.  I mean she was a vibrant person who worked hard and played hard and loved life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how long was she with you?
Speaker 2: Until she was ninety-eight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she played a vital role in my life from, you know, from when I'm born until when she dies in 1989.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I purposely stayed in town to go to a local college [Loyola College in Maryland; Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland] to be closer to my mother [Betty Jackson Merrill], father [George Merrill] and my great-grandmother.  I do, I got one more, quick story.  My mother has often told me how one of the two or three times in my life as a child that I got a physical beating, a punishment.  Number one was I--she came from work one day and Nanny Jack was a little bit disturbed and my mother said, "Well, what's wrong?"  She says, "Well, Philip [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill] slapped me."  And, so my mother said, "Oh, okay well then I'm going to have to punish him for that."  So I got punished, I think I got a beating and my grandmother--great-grandmother was so upset with my mother for beating me even though I deserved it that she would not speak to her for two weeks. True story.  I was the apple of the eye, of her eye.
Story_ID: 661449
Speaker 1: Now you talked about going back to the--well, okay.  Now this is your grandmother, your great-grandmother [sic. maternal great-great-great-grandmother], Jennie [Jennie Berry] that actually was in Charles Town [West Virginia] that, who's--
Speaker 2: Jennie, Peachie [Merrill's maternal great-great-grandmother, Peachie Berry Baltimore] and Gertrude, Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they were all in Charles Town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so the family that you talked to in this retirement community then, they remembered all them or did they?
Speaker 2: They remembered pieces of them, yeah, of Jennie and Peachie.  It was the Snyder [ph.] family.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a German, is a German descent family--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a husband, wife that were still alive.  They were not in Charles Town at the time. They were in Winchester [West Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So again I was blessed by going into the library to do some original research.  The person who stepped beyond their normal protocol because they were excited and they picked up the phone and they called people and that started the domino effect of me getting connected to people that could help.
Speaker 1: Did Nanny Jack have any stories about the Snyders?
Speaker 2: Just sleeping on the floor which they confirmed and, you know, that she worked hard for them and that they were kind people, you know.  But no, nothing earth shattering that would be quote, sexy or violent or anything like that.  They were just, they were good German white folk.
Story_ID: 661450
Speaker 1: Now in terms of your mother [Betty Jackson Merrill]--now what has your mother passed on about growing up in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, you know, historically when I give lectures and things I talk about Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson] because the business [Nanny Jack and Company, Baltimore, Maryland] is named after that but I've got, I've got to give the true props to my mother because I am because of her.  As a schoolteacher, that schoolteacher mentality was in the house.  So the love of learning, the love of being inquisitive, the love of show and tell, of expressing yourself, of being confident, of being flexible--all the strong attributes that I developed came from my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so I take it that she grew up in Old West Baltimore [Old West Baltimore Historic District, Baltimore, Maryland] too and (mumbles) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, she grew up at 1307 North Stockton Street in Sandtown [Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore, Maryland].  And, you know, she can talk about the doors being left unlocked.  She could talk about when street lights finally come, you know, you know, when the cobblestone streets had changed to asphalt.  I can remember the riots of '68 [1968] but she can remember them even more because she was grown and what she had to do to save a relative who broke curfew with the National Guard are right there with their guns and so forth after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  But she can also talk about the fabulous experience in a sustainable black community during the Jim Crow era.  She could walk to school which is something that I never had the privilege of being able to do.  She could really spend from kindergarten through in some cases twelfth grade with the same group of people that often were your neighbors.  You know, you went to church with them, you went to school with them, you played with them that has somewhat been lost as we've entered into the new millennium and beyond.  She could talk about the arabbers that would come into the neighborhood with their horse and wagons singing watermelon, cantaloupe that were an early version of a supermarket on wheels.
Speaker 1: So what did you call them, the what?
Speaker 2: They are called arabbers.
Speaker 1: Arabbers?  Okay, so this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --this is--
Speaker 2: This is good history here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a tradition that goes back to the 1800s where black men and young men are hawking their produce wares from a horse and wagon and they could sing rhythmically with regard to the content that they were selling.  Hence I'm not a singer that's why I will not give you an example of how they really did it but they are still functioning today.  But during Jim Crow it was a big part of the black community because you could depend on certain days hearing the bell and the click clack of the horses and the men singing with regard to the vegetables, fruit and other things that they were selling.
Speaker 1: That's right, it's tradition.  I caught the tail end of it with the watermelon man.
Speaker 2: Right, well, yeah, well, see, but they had more than watermelon.  They had cantaloupe and they had, you know, bananas and all kinds of things that's different than the rag man, that's different than the coal man, that's different than the junk man.  So, you know, my mother relayed many of those wonderful stories.
Speaker 1: Well, the name arabbers, that's--I don't know, I--that's interesting.  Do you, do you know the origin of that or--
Speaker 2: No, I do not and if I'd known that we were going to be this excited about it, I would have brought from the archives a bell from one of the horses from the 1920s that we have.  And often in lectures I ring the bell and no one can guess what it is, especially out of town.  Some of our local people can and they would get all excited and want to raise their hand and want to break into song because the arabbers were that much a part of the black experience in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not just West Baltimore but East Baltimore, South Baltimore, they would go for miles hawking their wares.
Speaker 1: So they travelled together?  Was it sort like a caravan or something or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, but they would operate out of different stables so you could see some of the same men working together but they would separate to go their own ways.  This is a multigenerational business.  Many of these men put their children through school, through college, purchased homes.  This was a legitimate entrepreneurial effort.  There was nothing illegal about it and today some of them are still around selling their wares in Baltimore City.
Story_ID: 661451
Speaker 1: You said that Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson] had a chance to go to fourth grade, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, do you know what, what the name of her school was by any chance?
Speaker 2: No, and, now Larry [Larry Crowe], I'm really, I'm really feeling sad because (laughter) you're asking me questions that I wish that I had thought about at the time when she was alive and, or when I was going down there to try to research.  I don't know other than it was a one room schoolhouse that would have been indicative of that time period.  I have since, have lectured on Rosenwald schools across the country and presently working on something looking at segregation in schools right now but I can't tell you the name of the one room schoolhouse that Nanny Jack and others went to in West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can probably with some additional research limit it to one or two within a dem- in a geographical area but I just, at the moment I do not have that information.
Speaker 1: And she grew up in Winchester [West Virginia], right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay.
Speaker 2: In Jefferson County [West Virginia].
Speaker 1: Jefferson County, okay.
Speaker 2: The Snyders [ph.] were in a retirement community in Winchester when I went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I see what you're saying, okay.
Speaker 2: --meet with them.
Speaker 1: So she was in rural Jefferson County near Charles Town [West Virginia] but not in--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Charles Town.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Charles Town, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  So, now--
Speaker 2: Excuse me, not far from the Storer College [Harpers Ferry, West Virginia] that is no longer functioning.
Speaker 1: Oh, right, right.
Speaker 2: An important HBCU [historically black colleges and universities].
Speaker 1: Right, right, and that closed in '59 or '69 [sic. 1955]?
Speaker 2: In the '50s [1950s], yeah, with integration.  I was fortunate to in- to interview the last black president of that college, Dr. Richard McKinney [HistoryMaker Richard I. McKinney].
Speaker 1: Right, great man, great man (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, indeed.
Story_ID: 661452
Speaker 1: Now where'd she [Merrill's mother, Betty Jackson Merrill] go to high school here in Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Good story.  My mother tells the story about being one of the early black students to matriculate at Western High School [Baltimore, Maryland] and she talks about how the black students in those days had two things to be selected.  You had to be really smart or really light and, so she says guess which one (laughter) fit her bill and it was the smart one (laughter).  So my mother was not in the first class but in one of the earlier classes to be chosen to be a black student to attend Western High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But before that she went to now historic schools in Old West Baltimore [Old West Baltimore Historic District, Baltimore, Maryland] that often in those days were identified only by a number.  And, so when you interview different people they can't tell you the written name because they only could identify it as School No. 112 [School No. 112, William M. Alexander Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland] or School No. 181 [School No. 181, Charles Hamilton Houston Junior High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  I come along as a stirring researcher and oral historian and I'm like, wait a minute I know of this as 112 was known as William Alexander, 181 was known as Charles Hamilton Houston.  So, you know, she could walk to--within minutes to both of those schools but had to catch the bus to go to Western High School when it was downtown.  So it was an issue of transportation and an issue of dealing with new white folk that normally were not directly right there in Old West Baltimore when she was at the two black schools.
Story_ID: 661453
Speaker 1: Tell the Richard McKinney [HistoryMaker Richard I. McKinney] story, how you, how you met Richard McKinney who was the last president of Storer who we interviewed back in 2003?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So The HistoryMakers interviewed Richard McKinney in 2003?  I have a Richard McKinney story for you.  I was out in an antique show looking for African American treasures.  I purchased a document signed by Richard McKinney in the '50s [1950s] on Storer College [Harpers Ferry, West Virginia] letterhead.  The white antique dealer said, "I think you should try and find this man.  He is still alive somewhere near Baltimore, Baltimore County [Maryland].  He was the last black president of Storer."  I'm like what, I didn't know he was black especially because in the letter he's talking about Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and I just in my naivete or lack of true scholarship about what blacks matriculated at this Ivy League institution, I just figured this was a white president asking for money from his fellow Yalies.  I contact McKinney and the rest is history.  He was delighted.  We sat down, we talked about his Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] activity, we talked about his scholarship, his work at Morgan [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and in Storer.  But just a delightful man.  I also got to meet him again when I was doing a lecture in front of the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity].  So, you know, I have nothing but mad respect, I'm very humbled and honored that I could even sit in his presence.
Speaker 1: Yeah, great Richard McKinney.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, yeah, I just thought we should get that in there.

Speaker 1: So you were talking about your mother [Betty Jackson Merrill] going to, she went to Western High School [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: And, so, so she was smart and at Western High School (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and attractive, just not light bright, okay (laughter).  I've got to get that on the record, okay.  And still attractive today in 2013 (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so she, now she goes on to college to, you know, she is a teacher, right?  So she went on to college.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where did she go to college?
Speaker 2: She went to Coppin [Coppin State Teachers College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland] at a time when Coppin was cranking out some of the leading educators in the region with gloves, pocketbooks, matching hats, charisma, Zaner-Bloser Handwriting and nothing but passion, knowledge and deportment.  It was the epitome of what a teacher should be like that came out of Coppin during that time period.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now I'm in--did she teach in the Baltimore school system [Baltimore City Public Schools]--
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: --afterwards?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She went to teach in historic East Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland] (laughter) at School No. 16 known as Johnston Square [School No. 16, Johnston Square Elementary School] located at Valley [Street] and Biddle Street.
Story_ID: 661455
Speaker 1: Now let me go to your father's side and then I'll try and put them together.
Speaker 2: Good luck with that but, okay.
Speaker 1: All right (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Okay.  George Bayard Merrill [George Merrill], G-E-O-R-G-E, B-A-Y-A-R-D, M-E-R-R-I-L-L.
Speaker 1: And what his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March 15, 1947, I hope I got that right and he just passed in December, oh, my Lord.  I might have to check that out for you but Baldwin, Maryland.  For the record I need to state he legally adopted me at the age of six.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he is not your biological father?
Speaker 2: No, but he fulfilled the role of being my father after legal consent from my biological father [Wayland Jones] who was from Raleigh, North Carolina and who went on to become a prominent medical doctor in this area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So but your--can you give us your biological father's name?
Speaker 2: Can I?
Speaker 1: Will you or--
Speaker 2: I can, I'm not sure that I will, but I will say this, he went to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] and then to Meharry medical school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and came to Baltimore [Maryland] in the late 1940s and was at the historic Provident Hospital.  Yes, I did know him.  Yes, I spent time with him on a regular basis up until my mother [Betty Jackson Merrill] marries George in 1968 after two weeks of dating.  It's the first year that miscegenation is happening here in Maryland.  A year before they would have had to go to another state to get married. George is white.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So George Bayard Merrill is white.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, okay.
Speaker 2: And they met at School 16 [School No. 16, Johnston Square Elementary School] at Valley [Street] and Biddle Street in East Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland].  During the height of civil rights, pioneering interracial marriage with all the trimmings, trappings and everything you could imagine that would come with it but all based in powerful love.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did George Bayard Merrill basically raise you as your, as your father?
Speaker 2: From six on, yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  So you didn't have a relationship with your biological father after that or--
Speaker 2: No, I did, it's just that the legal consent says that your stepfather, which I never called him and I still don't think of him as my stepfather, he takes over, you know, he's everything.  I would see Doc sometimes, not a whole lot, not like I used to but I would still see him.  I'm still connected--I will always be connected to my biological father. My mother tells me some days, she's like, "(Makes sound) Your suits hang on you the way they used to hang on Doc."  And some days when I'm doing oral history with elderly people in the community, they'll say from here (gesture) on up I look like someone that they know and they keep pressing me and eventually it comes out.  Because in any town, it's a small town, when it comes to dealing with certain issues and when your biological father was a person of prominence and you look somewhat like that person, you know, I may not have to say anything because the other person can put two and two together and say, "Oh, my goodness you look like So and So."
Story_ID: 661456
Speaker 1: We're not able to do it here, we don't, we are not from Baltimore [Maryland] and I wasn't trea- treated by him apparently, but somebody watching this probably can, but why the--is, why is it like a secr- a secret?  Why is it unstated, yeah (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's not a secret, it's not a secret.  It's something that I rarely talk about.  I will say that I am very proud that an elderly person who is in her early hundreds, she is a hundred and something, gave me his yearbook from medical school, from Meharry.  That's a gift that I hold near and dear to my heart.  I get to see him in his younger days as an Omega [Omega Phi Psi Fraternity] and at Meharry medical school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and so forth.  I'll give you his name. It's Dr. Wayland E. Jones, J-O-N-E-S [Merrill's biological father, Wayland Jones].
Speaker 1: Okay.  W-H-A-L-E-N?
Speaker 2: No, W-A-Y--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --L-A-N-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Wayland Jones, okay.
Speaker 2: From Raleigh, North Carolina.  A whole lot of mulatto research that I've been doing tied into the family going back to also the 1850s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are there any stories about his side of the family that are, that are, that you know?
Speaker 2: No, again unfortunately as a one, two, three, four, five, six and on--I wasn't asking him questions then.  I was just, you know, excited to be around him.  I have fond memories of his cars.  As a, as a doctor he was always sporting a nice new ride.  He had the Lincoln Continental with the tire in the back in the late '60s [1960s] with the headlights that went up like this that I just loved when we'd get together to go for a cruise.  I always loved going into his medical office at one point thinking that I wanted to be a medical doctor like him, but I don't do well with needles and other situations that come with being a doctor.  So that concept kind of went out the window.  His office was within historic Old West Baltimore [Old West Baltimore Historic District, Baltimore, Maryland] and Sandtown [Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So do you, do you--does his side of the family really know about you?  Is there any kind of relationship?
Speaker 2: No, none whatsoever. There is no, there is no connection whatsoever.  I have not pursued it and it would be hard for them to track me down unless someone was trying to dig really deep and figure out, well, you know, what happened here.
Story_ID: 661457
Speaker 1: I think I kind of understand the situation be- better now, though, too.  This is, this is something that happens in a lot of families where you have like a side of the family that doesn't know, even know you exist.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, and because of how I was raised in this loving household I never saw George [George Merrill] or in this case dad as stepdad.  He was dad.  He agreed to adopt six year old Philip [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill], loved my mother and take on seventy some year old Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson] and a whole bunch of sometime no good cousins and other relatives.  That defined my family.  I saw love in a light that I never thought existed, and I've often said to him when he was alive, "I don't know how you did it but thank the Lord that you did and I don't know if I'm that kind of man that I could do that."  So, you know, it's a powerful, it's a powerful testimony.  Again, this is 1968, his family says, "You marry that black woman and take on the son, we will disown you." He said, "Go right ahead, do what you got to do."  He loved my mother after two weeks of dating and for forty-four years they had one of the best marriages on the face of the, on the face of earth.
Speaker 1: So did they disown him?
Speaker 2: Well, no, but the--it was difficult sailing for a while but within a year the mother, Mom Merrill, Anne Merrill [Anne Totten Merrill] came around and Dr. George G. Merrill [George Merrill, Jr.] took awhile for him to soften up but, you know, life has a way of evening the score so to speak.  And Doc- Dr. Merrill died at the age of ninety something in maybe 2006 or so and before he passed, he told my mother in his deep voice (imitates George Merrill, Jr.), "You know, Betty [Betty Jackson Merrill], I think if I could get married again I'd marry a black woman." (Laughter).  So, you know, that's that full circle that life tends to let you travel on where, in the late '60s [1960s] he didn't want his son to marry a black woman, but decades later he admits that if he could get married again he'd probably marry a black woman.
Speaker 1: Well, it's not a small thing for anyone to be a doctor, so his father was a, was a in- was a medical doctor and your fa- father was a teacher.
Speaker 2: My--George was many things.  He started off being a teacher fresh out of Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire].  Back then the school system wanted--they were looking for men who could walk and talk at the same time so to speak and he could do that.  And he ended up being placed in an urban school in essence in the ghetto.  My mother was a superior teacher.  He would go to her for help.  They would have lunch frequently and he kept asking her out, she would say no and eventually she said yes.  Two weeks after that whirlwind dating they were married and had the best marriage of any of his siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He went on to become a government worker, went on to become a corporate tax attorney and a pastor and a big part of the Nanny Jack and Company organization [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he goes on to become an attorney.  Now what about, what do you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: They go back to 1066 with the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror.  It's all documented somewhere but unfortunately I've had no--I'm telling you the truth, I haven't had a lot of interest in finding out which relative has a copy of it or which institution it's been placed in.  They were related to the Browns of Rhode Island, tied into slave trading and so forth.  So it's a, it's a fabulous story on his side of the story but with the limited time that I've had and have I focus more on my maternal side of the family from Nanny Jack's side, a limited amount on my biological dad's [Wayland Jones] side but more on other people's families because it comes with the territory with my work.
Story_ID: 661458
Speaker 1: When you look at all these influences on you growing up, you know, and all the personalities that influenced you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Their, their sense of humor, their talents, their--how they walk, how they talk, how they approach things.  Who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: That's a tough question, Larry [Larry Crowe].  I can't say that I take after one more than the other because I've been blessed with this kind of smorgasbord, this kind of buffet (laughter).  So I would dare say that I could take a piece from this person--some from here and some from there that helped to define and create the character that I am today.  But I would dare say largely my mother [Betty Jackson Merrill].  My mother is a strong willed person much like her mother, much like Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson].   My sister [Melissa Merrill Floyd] is that way today as is my seven year old daughter [Indie Merrill].  So that gene is very strong within all of us.  There is more than one way to handle a situation, and my mother like Nanny Jack and like others have the ability to handle it in a calm manner, handle it in a not so calm manner, handle it in a prayerful manner.  Had the ability to handle the situation at the right moment for the right time.  I don't know if that makes sense. What I'm trying to say is that some people think that you got to brow beat somebody with a situation but if you do a proper assessment, then you offer yourself a lot of different avenues as to how to solve a dilemma and that's a skill that comes from my family.
Speaker 1: Social IQ they call it, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Story_ID: 661459
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory?  Oh, sure, I've got lots of them.
Speaker 1: No, an earliest (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, (gesture) an--the earliest one.
Speaker 1: An earliest one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd have an earliest one, um-hm.  It would be sitting out on the steps at 1307 North Stockton Street [Baltimore, Maryland] as people would come by, they would ask me what did I want to be, what did I want to do with my life and I would say, "I like to grow up, I'd like to grow up, get a good education and get a job."  They would give me money; I was loaded.  As a little boy I always had money because I was always loquacious, outgoing, overly truthful, and the people in the black community love that.  That I could speak and I was expressive and they would give me money (laughter).  Very fond memory of getting money from just speaking, which is what I still do today.
Speaker 1: There you go.  Okay.
Story_ID: 661460
Speaker 1: This historic Old West Baltimore neighborhood [Old West Baltimore Historic District, Baltimore, Maryland], growing up there, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells of growing up--well, let me back up, I spent from zero to six there.  See, the rest of the time--a couple of years I spent in Park Heights [Baltimore, Maryland] near Pimlico, not far from the famous Preakness racetrack [Pimlico Race Course, Baltimore, Maryland] in that area.  But from ten on I was here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, just describe all of them then.  I mean, that's the (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Okay.  The--what I remember about Stockton Street, at 1307 North Stockton Street in Old West Baltimore was the sense of familiarity with everybody.  It was a true neighborhood, it was cohesive.  It was together which, you know, today many of us don't know our neighbors.  Everybody knew each other because many of the people there had been there for generations.  So it wasn't like you were just the first generation just moved there.  My mother--that's the only place my mother lived.  So she knew people's grandparents, their children, their children's children and, so here I come, I'm Betty Lou's boy.  You know, my mother's name again was Betty Louise Jackson [Betty Jackson Merrill] so that's Betty Lou, that's Betty Lou's son over there.  So already the social IQ or the, or the--I can't think of it--the cultural capital was already established.  I was Little Lord Fauntleroy in the neighborhood because of Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson] and Betty Lou.  So I can remem- I can remember the horses coming through with the arabbers that we talked about, I can remember just the steady stream of characters in the neighborhood that had nicknames that today when we sit around and laugh and talk they can talk about the nicknames, I'm just wondering well, you know, who is Macaroni Man and what about Superman and what about this and what about that because, you know, decades later, that's real good history.  But growing up, you know, I saw these people but I'm too young to really know them.  I loved sitting out--to this day I'm a people watcher, my daughter is a people watcher (laughter), Nanny Jack was a people watcher, my mother is a people watcher.  We would sit out, not only on the steps but we had a glider, a wrought, an iron glider with two chairs.  We still have the two chairs in the garage that we saved but the glider's gone and you watch society go by your street.  But everybody knew everybody and it was safe.  You could sit out and laugh and talk and you knew your neighbors on each side and it just was a wonderful experience that I can only remember that much of because I'm so young.  Now I've heard about it.  The riots come in '68 [1968] and obviously the neighborhood is beginning to change and we leave.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the riots fairly well?  I mean, you would have been, what--
Speaker 2: Six.
Speaker 1: --six?
Speaker 2: The only reason why I remember them so well is that one of my relatives was in danger with the National Guard (laughter) for doing some activities that he should have not been involved in.  So that memory is fresh in my mind and being a little boy at the time that had a M16 rifle like they use in Vietnam (laughter), I could relate to the National Guard having a rifle and I was kind of scared though because, you know, that's real.  It's not on TV and it's not play.  It's--they are right in your block and in your community with a curfew.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any--now you were close to Pennsylvania Avenue.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about that from, that--do you remember much from being there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Only walking to what is now known as the Avenue Market but back then it was called the Lafayette Market.  Baltimore City [Baltimore, Maryland] has lots of historic markets where you can go for produce and your poultry and vegetables and so forth.  Nanny Jack and I would walk there frequently.  It was literally a stone's throw to get there.  Can't tell you about the Royal Theatre [Baltimore, Maryland], I can't tell you about any of the stores because I'm too young.  Historically I can tell you about it.  From oral history and from artifacts in our archives but from my own memory bank I cannot, cannot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because you were too young to go to those places?
Speaker 2: Too--yeah, yeah, just too young, you know, and the change, the downward spiral was in full effect.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you moved after your mother got married [to George Merrill]?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that--okay.
Speaker 2: And Nanny Jack did not want to leave.  She had been there for thirty something years.  I mean, you know, it was quite a fight to get her to leave that homestead.  But she, did and we moved to Denmore Avenue, 4941 Demore Avenue in the Park Heights, Pimlico area within walking distance of where the Preakness is held which is world famous, part of the Triple Crown (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) right, that's right.
Story_ID: 661461
Speaker 1: We only stayed there for--until part of '71 [1971] or '2 [1972] and moved here in November of '72 [1972].  And the stories about the neighborhood there was that, it was also a neighborhood--could play hopscotch in the street, could play skelly top, we played stickman.  We actually threw footballs in the middle of the street (laughter).  There was some grass nearby in one of the apartment complexes that we could put on our football helmets and pretend that we were Baltimore Colt players [Baltimore Colts; Indianapolis Colts].  And we could go to the parking lot of a department store and play speedball where we would take chalk and make a plate up on the wall and throw a rubber ball really fast up against it when we were the batters.  I have very fond memories of community with my buddies.  So much so that when we moved here they were so excited to come, they walked to get here from Park Heights [Baltimore, Maryland] to where we live now in Ten Hill, historic Ten Hills [Baltimore, Maryland], which is near Catonsville [Maryland].  They thought we were the richest black people that they had ever met.  They had never seen this much land before the pool was put in.  When they were here, we could kick off the football from one end of the yard and just run on our own grass and tackle.  They just loved it, they thought, they thought of my father as their father.  So it transcended race because these are black boys that I played with.  I did not go to school with them because I went to private schools and they went to public schools, but they were family to us and vice versa.  So at my dad's memorial service in December of 2012, several of them came and spoke eloquently about the role model and the fact that they thought of Mr. [George Merrill] as their father.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So out here in Catonsville--
Speaker 1: This is Ten Hills.  We are not in Catonsville now.
Speaker 2: Okay, we're--
Speaker 1: This is Baltimore City [Maryland], Catonsville is in the county [Baltimore County, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm just saying that from a geographic--people may have heard of Catonsville, but they may not have known of historic Ten Hills where we live right now, where you are interviewing us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is--well, what is historic about Ten Hills?
Speaker 1: They call it a--first of all it was founded circa 1910.  It is a suburb type of environment within the city.  So it is designated historic because of the resplendent architecture, the landscaping of the trees and so forth.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Most people don't realize that this is the city.  We are four blocks from the county line, the median that runs up and down the street used to bring the streetcars or the trolleys out here and often when I interview eighty, ninety or hundred year old black folk, they say, "Oh, my Lord, you live out there? I can remember when my relatives and So and So used to do days work in those houses out there."  So we, you know, we integrated the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So when you and your mother [Betty Jackson Merrill] came, you integrated this neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Yes, with my, with my dad--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So much so that the cute story I didn't know until many years later was that Mrs. Bitner [ph.], the German widow that lived here, she told my mother that, "I was so impressed with little Philip [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill] that I wanted him to have a wonderful place to grow up in.  So therefore I accepted your bid for the property."  My parents had the lowest offer on the table for the property, but she was so impressed with me as a little child that she said, "I'm going to take your offer."  When I got to meet Mrs. Bitner at the time I was a serious baseball card collector.  I could spit out to you averages and teams and statistics and all this stuff.  And the World Series, the World Series was on in the back room and I talked to her about, and I talked to her about the Swiss cuckoo clock that she had on the wall that I wanted and other things so she just--we bonded.  And I didn't know that that bonding is what led us to ultimately getting this wonderful house.
Story_ID: 661462
Speaker 1: Now you're about ten when you moved here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I am, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --ten years old, 1972.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, so you said you stopped going to public schools and you're going to private schools then, right?
Speaker 2: I stopped going to public school even before that.  I had attended school with some--I went to a very good public school in Bolton Hill [Baltimore, Maryland].  Historic Bolton Hill is a very important white area near the Maryland Institute College of Art [Baltimore, Maryland].  F. Scott Fitzgerald lived over there and a whole host of other important people in American history.  One of my dear friends was Congressman Sarbanes' [Paul Sarbanes] son.  So I'm just trying to show you that it was, it was one of the leading public schools where people that wanted their children in a public school environment would send their children to School 66 [School No. 66, Mount Royal Elementary and Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland].  At the time it was called Mount Royal Terrace [ph.].  For a historic note, Carmelo Anthony went there as well (laughter), which is obviously a successful NBA [National Basketball Association] player on the New York Knicks, but he went there many generations later.  After leaving there one of my teachers suggested to my parents [Betty Jackson Merrill and George Merrill] that Philip [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill] could get admitted to the Calvert School [Baltimore, Maryland] where she was going to teach.  And we tried diligently but I was not accepted.  Calvert School was a and still is an elite private school that many diplomats and people with silver spoons in their mouths get to have their children go.  I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth, I was smart and had a lot to offer but I couldn't get in and we ended up going to the valley school [McDonogh School, Owings Mill, Maryland], which was a very small private school out in Green Spring Valley [Green Spring Valley Historic District, Maryland].  And I was one of few black students in the whole school.  Pam Schriver was a dear friend and classmate, famous tennis player.
Story_ID: 661463
Speaker 1: If I could go back to School 66 [School No. 66, Mount Royal Elementary and Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland], I do have a great story that I would like to relay to you.  I was raised the right way with love and support and respect of self and others and at School 66, there was a bully who used to bother me every day.  I could fight, but I knew it was against the rules, and I was very much into following protocol, rules, that's the way I was raised.  It got to the point that my mother said one day as she picked me up, she said, "Now listen, if you don't go and beat Miles [ph.] tomorrow when I pick you up and take you home, I'm going to beat you."  So what did I do?  I went in there, beat the crap out of Miles, solved that problem, the principal was excited, Miles' mother was excited, the teachers--because Miles was a major trouble person in that school. Not just bothering me but I didn't want to go against the rules, which were not to fight but when my mother broke it down for me, she said, "If you don't, I will," so I handled my business.  So that's one cute story from going there at School 66.  The other quick story was again tied into following rules, I would only speak when I wro- raised my hand and the teacher called on me.  When the teacher said, "Pack up your stuff," I did, when she said, they'd say, "Stand in line," I did, quietly.  They called my parents in, George [George Merrill] and Betty [Betty Jackson Merrill], to say, "We are very concerned that something is wrong with Philip [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill].  We think he is being abused at home or something," blah, blah, blah.  And they said (laughter), "That couldn't be further from the truth. What are you talking about?"  They said, "Well, he is disciplined, he's so," (laughter)--they were--in an incredulous kind of way, they were like, "Well, is that not what you want?  That's how he is, that's his personality, he knows how to follow directions.  You ask him to do something, he will do it.  We don't lay a hand on him."  So (laughter) that was just so foreign to them that a little precocious, outgoing, clever little boy could follow directions, which was me.
Speaker 2: That's something when the standard--I mean, the expectation is so low.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.  Isn't that something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  At any rate, so this is--these are memories of School 66?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And when I drive by there I have fond memories of playing and so forth and of cute little girls that I liked.  Even for years later I would hang my School 66 Christmas tree item that we made in art class on the, on the Christmas tree.  Even into, even in my adult years it would make me think of the little girl that--I made it yellow because hers was yellow.  I'm not going to tell you her name but (laughter)--anyway I have very fond memories of those years in the public school at School 66.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: As well as at valley school [McDonogh School, Owings Mill, Maryland] where in the fifth grade we had a total of thirteen students.  We combined the fourth and fifth grade (laughter) together.  So the student-teacher (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So this was really a private school.
Speaker 1: Indeed, it rea- it really was (laughter).  And from there I ended up going to Friends School [Baltimore, Maryland] in the sixth grade, founded in 1784.  The oldest Quaker school in the area.
Story_ID: 661464
Speaker 1: Before we go fur- further into Friends School [Baltimore, Maryland] I just wanted to ask you if there were any--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --major teachers or mentors in grade school leading up to Friends?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't call them mentors.  I mean I have fond memories of--I would just say, you know, under the category of fond memories I would tell you that Mrs. Kerwin [ph.], my kindergarten teacher at School 66 [School No. 66, Mount Royal Elementary and Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland]--I loved her dearly but I was concerned about her wrinkles because she was old, you know, I'm a little kid (laughter).  Ironically, later on I met her son (laughter), you know, he is a much older person but one thing led to another and we could put together that it was his mother that taught me which was kind of cool.  Mrs. Harrison [ph.] was another teacher.  I can remember going to the recreation center at the back of the school and people there were very kind to me all the time.  So I have nothing but fond memories of my teachers, my experiences and my classmates other than Miles [ph.] (laughter) the bully who I had to beat up so that I wouldn't get a beating.  And when I went to valley school [McDonogh School, Owings Mill, Maryland], fond memories of the teachers that I did not feel as though they treated me any differently because I was a person of color.  I had a choice of repeating the grade or getting tutored all year.  After consulting with my parents [Betty Jackson Merrill and George Merrill], we chose together to repeat the grade.  Now this was not because I was a struggling student in the public school system but the public school system was a whole grade behind or more, a grade or more the level of what was going on at the private school.  As a matter of fact, I had very good grades going into the private school, just that those good grades weren't (laughter) on the same level as to what was going on in the classroom, so I repeated the grade at valley school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your teachers were fair to you--
Speaker 2: Kind--
Speaker 1: --and kind.
Speaker 2: --as were the students.  I could go to their houses and play, go to sleepovers, as a matter of fact, the housekeepers were always delighted to see one of their own that was so articulate (laughter) which I hate that word when other people want to say, "Oh, you are so well spoken. You articulate yourself," this and that.  Well, can I be but anyway--
Speaker 1: Yes, you could run for president now.
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah.  They were so excited to see quote, unquote little black Philip [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill] that knew how to behave and that could come into these houses that were humongous.  These are mansions that I was going to play and go to sleepovers and birthday parties and that made me feel good even as a little child.

Speaker 1: Now tell us about Friends School [Baltimore, Maryland].  Now Friends School is a much celebrated school around here.
Speaker 2: Not only around here, across the country because as you well know, Michelle Obama and President Obama's children [Sasha Obama and Malia Obama] go to our sister school, Sidwell Friends [Sidwell Friends School] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  They are in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], they are in Delaware, they are in Sandy Spring, Maryland, they are in North Carolina.  Quaker school, strong abolitionist background.  As the old folks used to say, "I wouldn't take nothing for my journey."  There were some difficult times going to an elite private school during that time in history.  I'm there in the '70s [1970s].  There was some race issues there even within my own family.  My aunt, Nanny Jack's daughter, could not believe that her blood was going to the same school because she was a live in nanny for a family in the late '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s], and their white children went to that school.  So in her mind she could not fathom that Philip [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill] and my sister, Melissa [Melissa Merrill Floyd] could go to the same school.  So it wasn't until a visitation for grandparents or family day that (laughter) she came to the campus along with other family members and they could actually see us sitting in the classroom participating that she finally believed.  But there were other incidents where people wanted to touch my hair, you know, people talking about my lips, you know, my nose.  The standard situations that we're learning more about as we interview and research to look into minorities attending predominantly white schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now in terms of--well, were there any--now this is, this is high school, right at Friends?
Speaker 2: No, middle school.
Speaker 1: Middle school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  As a matter of fact, my sister was what we call a lifer.  My sister went there from nursery school to twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went, I came in the sixth grade so I already had a half of, half of my life experience at School 66 [School No. 66, Mount Royal Elementary and Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland] and then valley school [McDonogh School, Owings Mill, Maryland] to then go into the Friends School.  Now I have pictures that show for later of me at the school back then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with hair.
Speaker 1: What is your impression of Friends? How does it rank in terms of the other schools?  I mean the--
Speaker 2: Impressions then or impressions now?
Speaker 1: Now as you look back on it?
Speaker 2: Oh, humbled, honored, very thankful that my parents [Betty Jackson Merrill and George Merrill] sacrificed to send myself and my sister to a school of that caliber.  It laid the foundation for anything in life.  How to think, how to think outside of the box, how to be analytical, how to conduct myself in any possible arena.  Again there were some difficult times there, but it also helped to make me who I am today.  In the ability to persevere, in the ability to continue the lust for life, the lust for learning and exposure and experiences that I wish every boy and girl could have of any, any race, creed, color or class. But unfortunately they can't, you got to take a test to get in and then you also have to have a certain (laughter) amount of finances to attend an elite private school of that magnitude.  I am very proud today to be a tru- a trustee or an executor of a trust fund that a wealthy white family set up for some minority students.  I'm the only black alum that handles that.  There is a white alum, myself and then some staff.  So we get to look at the progress that these two minority students from kindergarten through fifth grade get to go to Friends on a scholarship that a white couple left (laughter) and then from fifth grade on to twelfth, Friends School will pick up the tab.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, I have a love-hate relationship with Friends School (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what's the hate about?
Speaker 2: The lack of diversity, the ability to really put your money where your mouth is, instead of just throwing crumbs or kind of half stepping with some initiatives.  But it's come a long way but again it could do more.
Story_ID: 661466
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers at Friends School [Baltimore, Maryland] that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember all my teachers.  As a matter of fact (laughter), one just passed recently, and it was in the paper, and she was in her nineties.  And she was my geography teacher in eighth grade.  I will say that some of the teachers in the middle school, middle school being defined as sixth, seventh and eighth grade, some of them came into teaching when we were there, and they left when we left.  Some of them now many years later--obviously we're an adult, and they always were adult so, now you can speak to them as an adult, and it's just, it's refreshing to be able to talk to your teachers, you know, and have a bite to eat or laugh and talk about life.  These were real people that were overly dedicated to the cause of enlightening and helping students become all they could become.  Whether it be in the sports field or athletic field, whether in the art world, music room or even with the fact that we had meeting for worship once a week.  Where we had to go to the Stony Run meeting house [Stony Run Friends Meeting, Baltimore, Maryland] and have meaningful worship, which is silent meditation, which is a part of the Quaker experience, which I look back on now and I'm like my goodness, how fortunate were we to have this mandatory time (laughter) during the middle of a hectic, stressful week to sit there and meditate or hone in or just focus.  You know, but as a younger person you may not have fully been able to grasp the benefit that that gave you.  Years later you're like (laughter), you know, how, how awesome was that?
Story_ID: 661467
Speaker 1: When did you manifest an interest in history?
Speaker 2: Not at Friends School [Baltimore, Maryland] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not at Loyola College [Loyola College in Maryland; Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland], which is now a university.  As a matter of fact, I detested history because I never saw a--I didn't see the relativeness, I didn't see any relation to me.  I really wasn't that excited about learning about [President] George Washington or, you know, any of the standard people that were in the history books back then.  And needless to say there wasn't any topic such as Afro or African American history or culture that was being taught back then.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, we were lucky if you learned anything about Frederick Douglass or Harriet Tubman (laughter), maybe Sojourner Truth and maybe the assassination of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] or something but overall--and didn't even do well in history at Friends.  As a matter of fact, what is so ironic about all this is one of the history teachers that I won't name, years later when I was appointed by the city council [Baltimore City Council], mayor and city council to a commission couldn't wait to contact me to let him know, to let me know how proud he was of me and what I've done with my career and blah, blah, blah.  And I wanted to say, "Well, no thanks to you," (laughter), but I didn't.  I just smiled and humbly said, "Thank you."  But my love came from home.  My love of history came from the fact that my parents [Betty Jackson Merrill and George Merrill] were history, being an interracial couple, that was history.  Nanny Jack's [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson] stories about domestic work, coming from West Virginia and just, you know, I was surrounded by history.  And at Loyola, a Jesuit institution--so someone says, "Oh, my goodness.  You've got Quaker then Jesuit," and my honorary doctorate is from a theo- a Baptist theological seminary [Eastern Theological Seminary, Lynchburg, Virginia] (laughter).  Someone could say, "Wow, look at this whole religious experience."  Yeah, it's exciting but my love of learning and history came from the house--
Speaker 1: Speaking of--
Speaker 2: --came from home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Stories you were telling before that--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that linked directly to historical information.
Story_ID: 661468
Speaker 1: About religion, now are you--did your family attend church much or was that a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: It was a part of growing up but not like the generations before.  Not like in my mother's generation.  My mother [Betty Jackson Merrill] can talk to you about the Sunday school experiences and just the hub of activity that you could get from attending church regularly.  You know, church picnics, church this, church that but at time I come along, we are going to different churches.  As a matter of fact, this is a, this is a great early childhood story.  Not one of the earliest ones like you asked earlier but an early one.  We were, we were attending historic Bethel A.M.E. Church in the 1300 block of Druid Hill Avenue in Old West Baltimore [Old West Baltimore Historic District, Baltimore, Maryland].  On Sundays after church, the pastor would stand out at the door and greet the parishioners and congregation members as they leave.  My mom and I were walking out and Reverend Frank, Dr. Frank--Reid's father [Frank M. Reid II] was the pastor then, Reverend Dr. Reid [Frank M. Reid III] is the current pastor, his father was the pastor then, and he says, "Philip [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill], why don't you like me?"  I may, I might have been six, I can't remember the exact age, and I'm a little hesitant to tell him but I was a truth seeker then as I am now and speaker and I said, "Well, it's because you've got those spots on your hand and you're old," (laughter).  I told the pastor this, he asked me and I told him.  So, you know, we would also go to Quaker meeting house, at Gunpowder [Gunpowder Friends Meeting, Sparks, Maryland] which is a different one but very similar.  The meetings for worship are the same whether you go to Stony Run [Stony Run Friends Meeting, Baltimore, Maryland], Homewood [Homewood Friends Meeting, Baltimore, Maryland] or Gunpowder.  Different people may come but it is still a Quaker meeting for worship structure where there is no preacher or pastor or rector.  You sit there and meditate or in silence and you stand up and share whatever thought you want to share.  So, no--
Speaker 1: So that wasn't a big part?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: So church wasn't really a big part of growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, not as it, not like it used to be but we did go to--we were kind of going to the black church some points and then the Quaker experience at some point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was your stepfather [George Merrill] a Quaker or was he--
Speaker 2: Yes, but at the same time his father, Reverend Dr. George Merrill [George Merrill, Jr.] who was an Episcopalian (laughter) minister.  He was also a pioneering electroshock therapist and a coroner (laughter).  He led quite a prestigious professional career.  My dad comes by his spirituality honestly because his father was a minister and his grandfather was a minister.  Just not of, not coming out of a black Baptist organization, my dad was ordained through New Shiloh Baptist Church [Baltimore, Maryland] where the late Dr. Harold Carter [Harold A. Carter] was the pastor, a civil rights leader.  And then my dad and mother started a nondenominational church.  So--
Speaker 1: Was that while you were still going to school?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, this was, this was--
Speaker 1: Much later?
Speaker 2: Yeah, much later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he broke from, my dad broke from the Episcopalian ministries that his family had gone back to the 1800s with to be a Baptist now, you know, a nondenominational pastor.
Story_ID: 661469
Speaker 1: In high school did you--now were there any other black students at Friends [Friends School, Baltimore, Maryland] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, there were.  In my graduating class in 1981, of seventy-one students there was a grand total of two of us.  In sixth grade, there were more but as the years went by the black students left our class for personal, emotional, financial, academic--a myriad of reasons caused them to leave.  So it was myself and a, and another gentleman.
Speaker 1: So out of eighty--
Speaker 2: Seventy-one.
Speaker 1: --seventy-one--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --seventy-one, two graduated.  I didn't--now we mentioned this earlier but you were in--so '81 [1981]?  See, you're in like middle school when 'Roots' comes on te- on television then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1977.
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977]?
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: So (unclear) did that, how did that affect you?
Speaker 2: Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm sorry, Larry [Larry Crowe], because I get my driver's license in '78 [1978] so, no, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in upper school.
Speaker 1: So you're in high school?
Speaker 2: I'm probably, I'm probably a freshman, I'm probably in ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, but here comes 'Roots,' right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alex Haley's sa- saga, what did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Glued to the tube, glued, I mean, just mesmerized.  As a matter of fact (laughter), I have to chuckle at this.  One of the summers, you know, I may, I--was I, did I get my license--one summer I work at a fast food joint because the summers before I had nice jobs that my father [George Merrill] got me and I wasn't satisfied.  I worked at the [U.S.] Senate, I worked for Edmund Muskie, Senator Muskie's office and I didn't like catching the train everyday as a youngster going to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] during the summer.  So the next time, mom [Betty Jackson Merrill] and dad said, "Okay.  Since you didn't like that for your summer job, you go off and find something."  And it was very hard, but I ended up working a fast food joint, and they used to call me Chicken George after 'Roots' and it was not the Chicken George restaurant that I was working at but they called me that because I was handling chicken and I was black, and 'Roots' was still in the minds of many people (laughter).  So I thought I would kind of throw that in.
Speaker 1: How did that work in an integrated setting?  Now they're watching this at home too, right.
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Your classmates, white classmates are watching. (Mumbles)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but as I, as I look back on it, it's not like it was a part of some current events or it's not like it's something that we discussed.  I had a big 'fro at different points.  You know, I never was the lightest person but, you know, I don't think that I remember an uptick of racial incidents or any type of teasing or negativity coming out of that historic saga that was on TV at the time.  I wish could tell you that I could but I can't, yeah.
Story_ID: 661470
Speaker 1: Now did you run for any class offices in high school [Friends School, Baltimore, Maryland] or anything like that or did you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was--yeah, I won some things but I lost something that I thought I was going to win which was the presidency, but they said I, because I was elected to too many other things I didn't get that. So I was a politician, I was an athlete.  I was elected to the special athletic forum when you have varsity letters in so many different sports during the course of your high school career.  And--
Speaker 1: What sports did you play?
Speaker 2: Soccer, basketball, lacrosse, but I played baseball outside of the school and, you know, my academics, my athletic scholarships fell through, but I was this close to getting a deal.
Speaker 1: For which one?
Speaker 2: For lacrosse--
Speaker 1: Lacrosse, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) which I didn't stick to.  Many of the people said (laughter), "If you had played this earlier or hadn't gotten injured in your year, you could have written your ticket anywhere" because I used my other athletic ability to play lacrosse.  I didn't really like lacrosse, my peers did, you know, I--it is not what I wanted to do.  You know, I've always been the independent soul.  Kind of go to the beat of my own drum.  I'm not a follower.  You know, and I--just because you're doing it and I might be good at it, it doesn't mean that it is something that I want to do, you know?
Story_ID: 661471
Speaker 1: Were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: Erratic, you can clearly see the classes that I liked, I excelled in, classes that I did not, you would wonder if it's the same person.  You would also wonder from hearing me speak and seeing me write to taking a standardized test was that the same person.  You almost wondered did somebody (laughter) sit in there because there was such a disconnect.  So, you know, I look back on those years and say, I got this quote from Kweisi Mfume, he was giving a lecture at Tufts University [Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts] one year.  I was doing an exhibit that--and talked at Tufts when he was doing something there and he said he graduated, thank you, lawdy, (laughter) so did I (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But nonetheless very proud, have been active on and off over the thirty some years of graduating from there as a successful alum with regard to going back and speaking, working on diversity issues and so forth with the current students there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went on to college.
Speaker 2: Also an erratic student.
Speaker 1: Did you have counseling about college?  Did they (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did I have what?  I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Counseling.
Speaker 2: Well, of course, of course (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did that play a role in the college you attended or--
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Sure.  We had guidance counselors that would talk to us about, you know, what they thought would be a good fit and what they didn't and, you know, the student, people would visit the campus and we could go visit them.  Our friends and our parents were very proactive in--it's a college preparatory school [Friends School, Baltimore, Maryland], so the whole idea is that you're going to go off to college.
Story_ID: 661472
Speaker 1: Well, how did you end up choosing Loyola then, I mean, as a--
Speaker 2: Truncated version.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The school that I wanted to get into was Washington and Lee [Washington and Lee University] in Lexington, Virginia.  I did not get in with a 6-4 vote.  If it was 5-5 I would have gotten in and there I could have played soccer and lacrosse.  In hindsight, which is 20/20, I thank the Lord that that did not work out.  I ended up going to one of my fall back colleges which was St. Mary's [St. Mary's College of Maryland] in southern Maryland [St. Mary's City, Maryland], and I did not like it there and transferred out into Loyola College [Loyola College in Maryland; Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland], which I liked.  My mother [Betty Jackson Merrill] had a master's degree from there and years later ironically Dr. Merrill [George Merrill, Jr.], my father's father left a huge chunk of money to the institution.  And Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson] actually could come to the campus to see me in my dorm and bring the housekeeper to clean my room.  So my white roommates just fell out to see, you know, their black roommate A, have a housekeeper and then his great-grandmother coming to the campus to take care of him (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what was your major at--
Speaker 2: Sociology.
Speaker 1: Sociology, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Did not get any real black history there, either.  My history again comes from home with being surrounded by antiques.  The love of storytelling and just, you know, life's experiences.  I loved old people because of my grandmother [Merrill's maternal grandmother, Mary Jackson Fleming] even though I might have had an issue shaking somebody's hand because the pastor [Frank M. Reid II] was old (laughter) at Bethel [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Baltimore, Maryland] but overall I just loved being around somebody that had that kind of wisdom, that kind of life's experience, the eyewitness to things that I could ask about.  You know, loud music and just clothing, and just, you know, Nanny Jack stopped smoking when Camels went to fifteen cents a pack because she refused to pay that much money for it.  You know, so she died in 1989 and roughly that's when I decided I was going to go out and find whatever I could about African American history and culture through artifacts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but nothing you picked up in college informed that search?
Speaker 2: No, I will say that in my high school yearbook I quoted Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Langston Hughes on my page.  We had our, we had an individual page at our school, not just a little blurb but a page.  So it had been germinating, so it probably was just bubbling up like a volcano waiting for the right time to erupt.
Story_ID: 661473
Speaker 1: Now was there a black student organization in Loyola [Loyola College in Maryland; Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I wasn't a part of it [African Student Association].  I--as a matter of fact, I didn't know what purpose they served.  I was a Brooks Brothers wearing prep (laughter), no socks, sailing shoes.  I went sailing, I went horseback riding.  A lot of things that I did, the BSU [black student union] didn't quite see me as being (laughter) quote, unquote black enough.  Some people today even have that issue, but I'm okay with that because I'm not going to allow someone to define my blackness.  Because it's a whole, a whole gambit of what blackness is, and I can't allow someone else to bring their pre- notions and put them on me.
Speaker 1: So you didn't feel any necessity to be part of the black student unio- union?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had friends that were black and still do, of course (laughter).  But I did not see that I had to be placed in that category.  It's coming from my house, it's coming from background in high school [Friends School, Baltimore, Maryland], it's coming from the fact that Paul Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar] talks about the two masks that we wear ['We Wear the Mask'].  I wore two masks, and sometimes we fall through the crack.  But nonetheless I can transcend both worlds.  Whether they, whether both worlds accept me the same way remains to be seen but I can go in both worlds.
Story_ID: 661474
Speaker 1: Did you join a fraternity or anything like that there [at Loyola College in Maryland; Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland] or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't have African American fraternities.  We did have the opportunity to join at other institutions.  My best friend at the time, who was a person of color, we came this close (gesture) to going to the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], the Kappas but we did not, and the rest is history.  Because of my line of work, the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], the Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and the Kappas have come after me repeatedly over the years to say, "Please, come," but I love the history, but I'm not interested in joining any Greek letter organizations.
Story_ID: 661475
Speaker 1: So when you're on the verge of graduation [from Loyola College in Maryland; Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland], you, now did you, did you plan to be involved in sociology or to go on to graduate school or what?
Speaker 2: No, had no idea.  I was taught that you go to college to get a degree and you take it from there but you go to college.  I was not the first college graduate in my, in my family.  It was expected.  So I was kind of going to let the chips fall where they may, and they did.  I ended up going into, eventually into our family business which was not history and culture but human services.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you weren't concerned about well, if I don't (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I actually was going to go get a job and then one thing led to another and eventually I end up working in a business that we created where we worked with welfare to work with mothers, [U.S.] Department of Labor, with Job Corps, legal refugees.  We created a company called Human Development Institute [Human Development Institute, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with up to fifty employees in, with offices in Norfolk, Virginia, Baltimore County [Maryland], Silver Spring, Maryland, Baltimore City [Baltimore, Maryland] and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, and your fam- I mean, you say the family created it, this is a not for profit right or (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was both.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: We had a--contractually, we had a for profit arm and a nonprofit arm with the Department of Labor, with the Job Corps campuses that we subcontracted with.  They wanted a for profit component but with the department of human resources and some of the other agencies that we had contracts with we were non profit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But the basic work was job rea- readiness for peo- people that work--
Speaker 2: Soft skills, will to work and then we had a job placement component to it, yes.  But we were working with at risk populations, welfare mothers, legal refugees with resettlement with jobs.  We had a multilingual staff in Montgomery County, Maryland and in Baltimore County and we did that for seventeen years.  We were very successful with it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I come from an entrepreneurial background.  I think, Larry [Larry Crowe], I should add that we owned five flower shops where we had a contract, thanks to my father [George Merrill] being the first employment initiative director for Governor Harry Hughes [Harry R. Hughes] to do something where we could train women over a certain age to reenter the workforce and we hired them to work in our flower shops.  So, you know, I got the bug in me.  In high school I was the second richest kid in my class at Friends School [Baltimore, Maryland].  One other gentleman, who I'm friends with on Facebook, made more money than me because he had a tree cutting business.  I had a maintenance business, I bought a used pickup truck and I paid my men four dollars an hour, these are my classmates and students.  Four dollars an hour in the late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s] which was way ahead of whatever the minimum wage was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a $1.75, I think.
Speaker 2: Because I charged eight to twenty-five bucks [dollars] an hour to do work.  My buddy that made more money than me, he could charge thousands, hundreds of dollars to cut trees down and he had a big truck and big equipment.  So the spirit of entrepreneurism was already there in high school.  Then with regard to my family us going into business even though my parents had professional careers they ultimately ended up wanting to create something of our own.  And, you know, with the good, bad and indifferent of being an entrepreneur, I wouldn't trade that for anything in the world.  You know, there's some, there is some difficult times but there is also some great times and there is nothing like owning your own.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's yours.
Story_ID: 661476
Speaker 1: When you graduate from college, right this is nineteen eighty what?
Speaker 2: Five [1985].
Speaker 1: Eighty-five [1985] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I graduate in the fall of '85 [1985] but walk in the spring of '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: All right.  So the country's experiencing relative prosperity, I guess these are Reagan years, right, tail end of the Reagan years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yeah, good old Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan].
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is where he--when (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Reaganomics (laughter).

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: People are talking about, you know, greed is good and all that, you know, so this is, so that's the climate in the country.
Speaker 2: I was considered a buppie, I was a black yuppie.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So tell us what were the steps that led to the founding of Nanny Jack [Nanny Jack and Company, Baltimore, Maryland]?  I mean, what--unless it just, it just popped--I don't think it just popped up, right?  I mean, you--it's something that you got involved in gradually.
Speaker 2: Yes and no.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Earlier I was stating Larry [Larry Crowe] that in my high school yearbook I quote Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Langston Hughes on my page.  I loved the essence of blackness that was in my house and that I experienced no matter how much interracial.  Anything that's going on I still knew that I was a black person and very proud of my blackness.  I had some displeasure in not learning anything or enough about the black experience at either Friends [Friends School, Baltimore, Maryland] and, or Loyola [Loyola College in Maryland; Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland].  So I'm struggling with the human services work [at Human Development Institute, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland] and on my lunch breaks, I would go out treasure hunting.  I would go to, I would take a long lunch and go to an antique store or, and this began to really just become cathartic.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a model for that kind of behavior because--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --there--now there is (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no, no, no.  Go ahead, I'm listening to you.  I want to hear what you're saying, so I wasn't being rude I was being--
Speaker 1: --not that there's not a history of black collecting.  There's a--the history collection goes all the way back to the 1700s by people--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --various individuals.  And we can name, you can probably name them too going, you know, forward.  Different people like Schomburg [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg]--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --and Jesse (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: --and other people collecting things, all the way down. There's Blockson [HistoryMaker Charles Blockson] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Sure, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So did you have any- anyone--any model in mind for this black or white about, you know, about going to these--
Speaker 2: Nope.  Trying to--
Speaker 1: You were just, you were kind of just drawn to this?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to create the road--I'm going to give you an example.  In the World War II book ['The World War II Black Regiment that Built the Alaska Military Highway: A Photographic History,' William E. Griggs] that I edited that we can talk about later, in Alaska the soldiers in order to move on the road, they had to make the road.  They had to knock down some trees, put down some rocks and some mud and whatever and then ride over and then start the process over again.  I didn't have a road to follow, there was no blueprint, there was no GPS [global positioning system], no role models.  I wasn't trying to be Schomburg, I wasn't trying to be Blockson.  I was trying to be me.  And, so therefore I just followed the spirit and, so if the spirit led me to a record store, which it did one day in my, in my nice Brooks Brothers suit.  I happened to find under the table a rare '78 [1978] album set signed twice by Nat King Cole and his trio [Nat King Cole Trio] with original photographs taped inside the cover, elated on my lunch break.  I went back to that same record store, found a signed Billie Holiday album cover.
Speaker 1: Now did the proprietor of this--the--this store know the value of what he had?
Speaker 2: Not at all and also this is pre 'Antiques Roadshow' days, pre all of this evaluation, pre all of this--not a clue.  To the point that she was the daughter of an elderly man who had ran this store for years.  So after the fact somebody may have gotten a hold of her to say, you know, that guy that you sold that to, he is pretty--he's a player, I mean he's somebody and, so she tried to buy it back but of course it wasn't for sale.  I'm talking about the Billie Holiday, which I will show you later because I pulled it out for you.  I did not know what to buy.  If it was black, I was trying to buy it, whether it be a photograph, letter, whether it be yearbooks.  I used to carry a backpack in the early days of collecting, of the collecting books that were out.  Most of the collecting books out then were dealing with mass produced stereotypical content.  So I was blessed with a photographic memory, so after a while I didn't need to carry the books because I had it visualized right here in my mind, so I would go out and buy them.  The salt and pepper shakers, the dolls, you know, the Sambo, the this, the that.  I quickly got bored with that.
Story_ID: 661477
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was, I think that was a publicized and promoted--I mean, I think it started coming to the public attention, the collection of those items in the, in the, I guess in the late sev- late '80s [1980s], (unclear) late '80s [1980s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there were--
Speaker 1: There's a--
Speaker 2: --some people that I had met at some of the black memorabilia shows that were ahead of me.  Steven Lewis, Malinda Saunders, Carson [Jeanette Carson], the lady who created the black memorabilias collector's magazine [Black Ethnic Collectibles].  So there were people out here that I could have used as role models but I didn't want to do it--I didn't want to collect what they wanted to collect.  I wanted to follow my spirit.  So I was ahead of the curve looking at public, social, family, community that type of history with regard to material culture.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I made a huge shift, I no longer wanted the mass produced stuff that everybody else had.  I wanted collections, I wanted ledgers from black churches or ledgers from Masonic lodges that talked about the dues and the daily issues of what was going on within that organization.  I wanted letters that give you the intimate feelings of a black writer.  When I mean a black writer, I'm not talking about a noted writer.  I'm just talking about the writer of the letter.  If the person is in jail, in the [U.S.] military, at college, on a, on a trip.  I wanted to be able to fully engross myself in the intimate black experience in America.  And I thought the best way to do that was through collecting and the collecting obviously led me to oral history that led me to--one thing built off of another.  But I obviously have Sambo, I have stereotypical stuff.  I did a big Jim Crow exhibit for West Virginia State University in Morgantown [sic. Institute, West Virginia] a couple of years ago but that's not my love, that's business.  I want to know what it was like to be black in this little town in 1875.  Well, letters, photographs, books, any type of material culture that--something from their jobs, anything that could give me a clue as to what life was like during that time period in that town, that's the kind of stuff I built the Nanny Jack and Company [Baltimore, Maryland] archives on which is a little bit, is a lot different than what most people think of when they hear of memorabilia.  I spent my life trying to tell people that memorabilia is not always perceived as something negative, stereotypical and souvenir or kitsch or I don't want to call it junk but memorabilia could be the program from the March on Washington celebration coming up in Au- in August--coming up soon in 2013.  You know, in the room there and I'll show you we have the original ticket stubs from '63 [1963] plus the badge, plus something else, that's memorabilia.  So that's historic memorabilia.  So in the scholarly world you want to call it material culture, but it's still the same.  Memorabilia, material culture, artifacts, we are talking about something that was used, carried or created by these people that were part of the experience, and that's what I built the archives on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you really, so did--you started then with the Billie Holiday and Nat King Cole, you know--
Speaker 2: No, I started (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) albums.
Speaker 2: --off doing--I started off carrying the kitchen, kitchen memorabilia, black memorabilia books and just the standard dolls, (unclear) cookie jar, salt and pepper shakers because that's what everybody was doing, that's what I saw when I would go to the shows.  But I quickly ditched that to want to get into the true essence of black life.  Black music, you know, black church, black cemetery, black funeral home, black business, you know, sports, military.  I--every now and then I will buy something that is stereotypical, but I'm buying it because it is a missing piece to a larger collection that I'm using to try to interpret something.  Again, that open for interpretation.  I'll give you an example working on World War I [WWI], saw a really stereotypical piece from World War I, I had to have it, okay.  It was a postcard of white soldiers, white navy soldier at a fair and it says something about tip a nigger for--it's one of those things where you throw something and actually on the post card it says tip a nigger for something.  And I said, "Oh, my goodness.  I need that to help tell a larger part of what was going on with these black soldiers during the World War I period."  There was a lot of racism.  See so that's the stereotypical kind of racist item, but I'm using it in a historic perspective.  It's not just oh, wow here's a racist postcard.
Story_ID: 661478
Speaker 1: How long was it before you started actually dealing and selling items or--
Speaker 2: I'm still not a seller.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've never really been a seller.  Every now and then I've sold something of my own but overall that's one thing that I have not done.  I've never been a dealer.  I've tried to broker other people's collections, unsuccessfully I might add.  It's a tough game.  It's a very tough market.  I have used the archives as a way to lecture, curate and evaluate other people's collections.  I could think of one popular item I sold on eBay [eBay Inc.] for eight hundred dollars.  I sold an early 1916 edition of The Sphinx magazine that is the organ for the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity.  I happened to have two that I got off the floor of a vacant house, there was no money invested, I'm not an Alpha, boom, okay.  I, for instance I was thinking recently about selling a Toni Cade Bamba- I never can say her name correctly.  She is a prominent, deceased black female writer.
Speaker 1: Toni Cade Bambara.
Speaker 2: There you go.  I have a rare book of hers, first edition signed by her.  I paid fifty cents for it at a flea market.  Everybody is in love with her work.  And if I sold it, it could help me buy equipment, it could help me or help me buy something that can better utilize what I want to do with something.  Is that clear what I'm trying to say to you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I--
Speaker 2: I'm not a dealer, basically I am not a dealer.  People usually that have gotten to this point of success, they are dealers.  I don't set up at shows, you know, I rarely sell on eBay.  I may barter with somebody privately where I will trade you, you know, three slave documents (laughter) for something that I'm after.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, so I'm just trying to clarify--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that when you go to the black memorabilia show or when you go to the Atlantic City [New Jersey] show which is the world's largest antique show in the world, I go to treasure hunt, to network, to look for people that I can interview.  So my whole concept of collecting is a little bit different than the people that you are more familiar with or their journey.
Story_ID: 661479
Speaker 1: There are also peo- people that collect items of--like for the Schomburg's [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg] collection.  He sold it to the New York Public Library [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, for the public's--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm a big fan, I'm a big fan (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) you know.
Speaker 2: of Arturo Schomburg and his, and his, and his legacy.  Sure, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Of course there are people like [HistoryMaker] Mayme Clayton (unclear).
Speaker 2: Sure, I'm--I was quoted in The New York Times about her collection.  I just recently did an evaluation tied into a major bankruptcy in Las Vegas [Nevada] to a pioneer, black deejay, Magnificent Montague.  Because of my work as an appraiser it was evaluated and something was done with the collection.  Painful story but he was a pioneer and collector in his own right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not the best educated, but his wife [Rose Catalon] went on to get a degree and he was a pioneering music deejay that was best friends with Sam Cooke, you know, Louis Jordan, you know, [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy.  He knew all these pioneering people and he created his own collection that is drastically different than the Nanny Jack and Company's [Baltimore, Maryland] collection, drastically different that [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson's, drastically different than Mayme Clayton's.  You know, the collector, the collector's collection is tied into a lot of factors.  Education, finances, discerning eye, interests, space, you know, life there are so many things that you have to take into consideration when you just want to make a blanket statement and lump these collectors together.  You know, some collect to get it off the market, some collect because they want to make money and resale.  Duke Ellington talks about music is his mistress, black history is my mistress and when I say black history, I'm talking about the material culture that allows me to better define and interpret the African American experience.  I get high when I'm around the collection, when I'm working on something.  Jokingly one day in the Catskills where the Job Corps center was that we were subcontracting with our company [Human Development Institute, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland], mom [Betty Jackson Merrill] and dad [George Merrill] got tired so they came out of the antique store and sat in the, in the van.  I came out with a box filled with original 78 records [78 rpm record].  I paid like two dollars for the whole box.  You know, Sarah Vaughan, Duke Ellington, Billie [Billie Holliday]--anybody you can think of and above average condition too on the original labels.  Not reprints or reissues and mom and dad said, "Boy, look at you, you're just carrying on," and I said, "Yeah, I'm so excited. This is better than sex."  They said, "Boy, you better get in your car, get in this car.  What did we do wrong, what did we do wrong," (laughter)?  So that obviously is not better than sex, don't get me wrong now, it's not but that showing you the level of my excitement that can build when I'm uncovering something new and exciting or working on something that I'm hoping to share with a larger public about an aspect that we don't know enough about.
Story_ID: 661480
Speaker 1: Now I'm not questioning your enthusiasm.
Speaker 2: Okay, good (laughter).
Speaker 1: But I'll judge if you add anymore.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: But the thing--what I'm asking about is are the economic dynamics of this.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because there is an economic dynamic.  When you acquire items--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --then they are redisplayed, some of them are anyway (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some of them.
Speaker 1: --and institutions, you know, pay through museums because they're, you know, paid to display these items, right?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or--
Speaker 2: But some you don't, some you do for publicity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Currently as this is being filmed in 2013, there is an exhibit at the American Visionary Arts Museum [American Visionary Art Museum] on Key Highway downtown in harbor, at the harbor [Inner Harbor] in Baltimore [Maryland].  There are two collections from our archives on display.  One of a under recognized interracial, homeopathic hospital that's not Hopkins [The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland], it's called Kennard's hospital [Medico-Chirurgical and Theological College of Christ's Institution, Baltimore, Maryland] where we have the original prosthetic leg, some 1800 medical books and a plethora of other authentic content on display.  Then for our new children's book in another section of the exhibit, there are the original illustrations that are in the book on display.  So that--no monetary was exchanged, but I did that because of fostering a relationship with the director and, it will lead to other things.  Other times I might rent something to a magazine, book or film company.  So I'm negotiating right now with an author with university of Harvard press [Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts], where she is working on a book coming out in 2014.  Found me on Facebook through some other research online, talked to me.  I am not giving her a whole new spin on her topic that she is under contract to write to come out in 2014.  She is going to pay our company [Nanny Jack and Company, Baltimore, Maryland] whatever the cost is to consult, to pick my brain and to have access to some content that I'm willing to share for her book.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there is an aspect of people paying to access content on some level, not to buy it but to access (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and I'm trying--
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: --I'm trying diligently now with a leading digital firm to create a portal, where if we give a lecture somewhere or we write a book of curate an exhibit, the items that we have can be, can be reproduced and you can buy them online.  You can pick the archival matting, the frame and so forth in one fell swoop and pay for it (snaps fingers) just like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a leading firm that reproduced the early Alpha Phi Alpha image at Yale that Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut] purchased two enlarged copies of and Yale could not believe the magnificent work that the digital firm did in reproducing this.  They can put it on any type of material.  It could be on canvas now and one will hang at the Afro, Afro American culture center [Afro American Cultural Center] at Yale the other one will hang in the paternity [sic.] house [of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the one product of this of collecting so many things and becoming knowledgeable about these things is the, I guess the capital, you know, that's invested in your own persona as a collector, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You become expert on these items.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And your consultation becomes more valuable because you know so many--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --aspects.
Speaker 2: Not only that but because I do write.  So I start off as a collector, become a historian, writer, appraiser, TV personality all because of the art of collecting.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the collecting has to come first, right?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: The collecting has to come first.
Speaker 2: In my world, it does.  But I'm not say--I can't speak for anyone else.  The collecting is what led me to sitting here today to talk to you and The HistoryMakers, which I'm so proud and happy to do.
Story_ID: 661481
Speaker 1: We live in a world, and I know you understand what I'm talking about that many others collect, you know, African American memorabilia and books (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --and other things and are expert, and I think there's--we don't, we don't know about as many of us that are involved in this.  So it's something that you would think we would have more access to our own things since they come (laughter), since they are produced by us and are around us but we don't have that many people trying to do this, right?
Speaker 2: No, we don't.
Speaker 1: And that's--
Speaker 2: And it's very sad.  Not only do we not have a lot of people--now we do, we do have an army, but the army is not as strong and as stealth or as accurate as I would like the army to be trained in and so forth.  It's an economic issue, it's a, it's a labor of love and not everybody sees the benefit of the effort.  It's quite a bit of work to go to auctions, flea markets, shop online, to dig in dilapidated vacant houses, to develop a network where you have pickers.  I used to have a network around the country where I wouldn't have to leave.  I could be talking to you right now and be getting people contacting me because they know that I'm looking for X, Y and Z and they found it and they want to do business with me.  I no longer do because I don't do a lot of acquisition these days and when I do, it's very quiet.  I learned from (laughter), I learned from the white society about how to use a straw person.
Speaker 1: Now tell us about that.
Speaker 2: I acquired one day a cabinet card photograph of Sojourner Truth, I fronted someone else.  The person contacted me, they were looking for a buyer, I said, "I know someone."  I put the money in the person's account, told this person to contact this person, they bought it, no one knew.  I learned that trick of the trade from the many experienced white historians, antique dealers and so forth that are out there that I try to cut my teeth with by going to auctions and sitting and observing the people that would be in an auction house running up their own item or having other people bid on it and stop bidding and before you know it someone else got it.  There is a lot of tricks to the trade.  Not everyone is filled with integrity or is honest as I am so therefore when you run into some of these difficult things, it's a painful pill to swallow but it's all a part of the life process of honing your skill or your trade or your craft.  Today at fifty-one, I'm a lot smarter, shrewder and tougher than I was in the late '80s [1980s] when I started.  I'm much more stoic, I will never be a part of the nigger tax game again.  Nigger tax is when (laughter) somebody sees a black person coming up and wanting to buy this item so they jack up the price because you're black and they know--and I was taught that it was called nigger tax.  I don't like that word of course, but I'm using it in context.  So for all the people that are watching this, you know, calm down (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, sometimes they call it the black tax--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --on things but it's the same--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --thing (unclear).
Speaker 2: I also learned from some successful white antique dealers that when it comes to buying, never speak first.  Let the person that is selling it speak to you because you could want to sell me a--let's just say a rare letter that's just surfaced from Frederick Douglass.  You have in your mind what you want for it, I may be so excited and blah, blah, blah that I'm about to offer you five times what you wanted for it.  So the rule of thumb is shut your mouth, don't say anything, let the person that's selling it speak first and then the haggle or the bartering or the exchange can take place.  I learned that from a very wealthy, wealthy white antique dealer.
Story_ID: 661482
Speaker 1: What are the dynamics of appraisal?  What, you know--
Speaker 2: What are the dynamics of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, what--
Speaker 2: --appraising African American material culture or just appraising anything?
Speaker 1: Well, is--well, I don't know if there is a difference between--is there a difference between--
Speaker 2: Of course there is a difference.
Speaker 1: Okay, between, okay.  Well, tell us--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --how it's done and what the difference is between the two.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The difference between the two--appraising African American material culture versus Americana.  Basically with Americana there is more documentation that has surfaced through auctions, through books or through exhibits or through some type of institutional, institutional activity that has documented this sterling silver collection or that has documented these quilts or has documented these letters tied into the War of 1812.  When it comes to black Americana, black memorabilia, material culture, the--whatever you feel more comfortable using, please use, often you're looking at the first time that the item has surfaced.  It's not in any of the leading auction houses that have famous black auctions now.  It's--it may not have surfaced on eBay [eBay Inc.].  It may not be in any antique digest or any of the famous collect- white collector reference books or even in any of the black ones.  So what can you base it on?  Sixty-four thousand dollar question.  That's here your knowledge comes in where you can say okay.  I did a wonderful appraisal of rare Sam Cooke images.  I love me some Sam Cooke, (laughter) grew up on Sam Cooke, okay.  Was just shaking like this when I touched these images.  How do you evaluate some images of a music icon like Sam Cooke?  Well, I had to look at what was out there in the market.  I also had to look at what role did this person play in the history of gospel and, you know, and secular music.  You know, he was with The Soul Stirrers before he left to go into his own music and you have to put that all into some soup and put some spice in it and that's how you come up with your evaluation.  Sam might have been difficult but imagine how difficult it was for me to do and my company when we did the hat collection for Dr. Dorothy Height [HistoryMaker Dorothy Height].  Let me say that again, the hat collection for Dr. Dorothy Height.  Where are you going to find other prices for hats that belong to the late Dr. Dorothy Height?  Very difficult--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to put a price on but at the same token if you are trying to appraise a hat collection for some (laughter) prominent, for a Jackie Onassis [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis] or for, or the queen of, queen somebody, there are comps.  There is something out there.  They have been exhibiting, they have been researched where you know who the manufacturer is, you know when she wore it because there are pictures and blah, blah, blah.  But when it comes to some of this black stuff, you're dealing with a wing and a prayer, which makes it difficult.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there is always going to be someone that says, "Oh, my gosh, that's too low," or, "Oh, my gosh, that's too high."  Well, then you do it.
Speaker 1: And, so I guess there are questions being raised when it's a Dorothy Height hat equivalent to a Jackie O hat--
Speaker 2: No, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in price or a Bella Abzug hat.
Speaker 2: Okay, (unclear).
Speaker 1: Or--
Speaker 2: See, (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Or, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and see, and she knew Bella, Dor- Dr. Height knew Bella.  See, so when did that evaluation we over, we gave them much more than they could pay for, and they still wanted more.  We limited the number of hats that we did.  I think we did three hundred hats.  I was having hat mares, not nightmares but hat mares because we photographed so many hats in so many different colors and time periods and this and that.  We lost our everlasting mind.  I had to spend hours in her condominium, you know, so someone could say, "Well, your documentation was fabulous but we disagree with your total price."  Okay, that's where my famous quote is, it's open to interpretation.  I showed you my methodology.  I talk about condition, manufacturer, significance and whatever else.  It's not like I, it's not like I just said, "Wow, this hat is going to be worth this much." I backed it up with some supporting data, when I could get it.
Story_ID: 661483
Speaker 1: In some cases with something there is nothing, there is nothing.  I can share with you items in our collection that is not another one anywhere.  So how do you put a price on it?  You can say, "Okay, well, something similar," but there--it's--that's not it.  It's kind of the frustration that I have when given the literary agents and part of their questionnaire package is they want to know what is your book similar to or what's out there that's the competition, there is none.  I'm not saying it in an arrogant way but this concept is new that I'm trying to put together in its book form.  If we talk about 'Black, Blind and Brilliant: The Life of George Raymond Reed' [ph.], the--Dave Chappelle's grandfather, a book that I am working on through the blessing of Dr. Yvonne Seon [HistoryMaker Yvonne Seon], a HistoryMaker herself.  Where is there another book similar to that one that's out there, there is not, there is not one similar to this book.  So take that and transfer that to trying to evaluate a unique collection of black Americana.  You know, it leads for a never, never ending journey of knowledge.  I am always trying to learn more.  When I do the verbal appraisers for the Chesapeake collector ['Chesapeake Collectibles'] we show on PBS [Maryland Public Television], I say a prayer before each segment on air because (laughter), you know, I got a little bit of time to quickly come up with something that I can base it on to throw out there to the public.  After the fact I'm like oh, my gosh, why did I say that, that was too low.  I'm going to speak right now on some letters from [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis that are in the current season, season three.  So it's in rerun, you can see it on line.  A woman came in whose mother was very close to Ossie Davis.  She had several handwritten letters from Ossie as well as some photographs signed by him.  The letters were intimate.  You clearly could tell that this woman who was white (laughter) had a very personal, intimate relationship with Ossie Davis.  Well, Ossie in the letter, I'm just giving you an excerpt, he says, "I've met a young lady that I'm in love with," it was [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee by the way, "I'm going to be monogamous now.  I'm not going to spit in any blind men's cup on the street anymore."  His whole life is changing because he's met this young Ruby Dee who he ultimately marries.  But in retrospect I think I appraised the letters too low, but you have a snap amount of time, a snap judgment to come up with something.  The cameras is in your face, it's live.  Now obviously if I mess up they can do it over, but I kind of pride myself on being the Teenie Harris [Charles "Teenie" Harris] of appraising where I can get mine out in one shot.  I'm making an analogy to a very important black photographer who was so skilled that he could get his stuff done with one shot.  I'm pretty good to the point where I can do one take for most of my film segments.  But, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.  I (unclear)--the appraisers on 'Antiques Roadshow' always seem so sure.
Speaker 1: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) they say, "This is worth"--
Speaker 1: The white appraiser seems so sure--
Speaker 2: He gives you the details though (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Right, right, yeah, because they have research assistants off air with lots of reference books and computer program that can pull up auction comps and so forth.  When I traveled with the show, I carried my own reference books with me because (laughter) there is not just that much available online to help guide me with what I'm looking at, it's just not even today.  Now there is a blessing that there--it's the Swann's auction house [Swann Galleries] in New York [New York] that every year they have the leading high quality black Americana auction.  So you get their catalog with prices realized that will help you.  Okay, but what about when the content is- isn't even in a leading auction with no more prices realized?  What a- what about when what you have hasn't surfaced anywhere?  And that's an ongoing concern.  The further time marches on, the more exciting never be seen, never before seen objects will surface.

Speaker 1: I mentioned Schomburg [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg] before who specialized in books, so did Blockson [HistoryMaker Charles Blockson], do you, do you sort of focus in on a memorabilia, you know, side memorabilia or some- or records or--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I'm strug- I'm strug (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you focus in on a certain aspect of material culture to collect?
Speaker 2: Then, now or when overall, help me out.
Speaker 1: Could be overall, could even be sequentially.  You started off with this and now you more, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm going to give you an analogy.  When you are young, you can eat anything and not gain weight, right and you've got a lot of energy, okay.  As you get older you began to--your metabolism changes, your appetite, you have a harder time losing the weight.  Now you've got to exercise and so forth.  Apply that to my collecting journey.  I'm very focused with regard to what I'm after now.  In the beginning I just wanted black.  I was following, I'm still following the spirit, the spirit speaks to me.  I see an object or a collection, it speaks to me.  If it doesn't speak to me, I don't care how much of a steal it is or how whatever, I'm not interested. I only want collections that speak to me.  So, now I am after collections that we can use for future projects.  I try to get things that no other collection in the country contains.  That gives us some instant worth and credibility and interest.  I'll give you an example.  We have the leading benevolent society collection for something from an organization that most people never heard of (laughter).  It's called the Grand United Order of Brothers, Sisters, Sons and Daughters of Moses [Grand United Order of Brothers and Sisters, Sons and Daughters of Moses], founded in 1870s [sic.] in Philadelphia [sic. Virginia] with chapters all across the country.  We have the original founder's [James Murray Jeffress] autograph in a bylaw book from 1873.  We have photographs and constitutions and a Ph.D. student was somewhat irate with us because she said, "Your company [Nanny Jack and Company, Baltimore, Maryland] has the leading collection of this, I'm working on this for my Ph.D., and I, and I can't pay your fee."  I tried to work with her but she still, you know, kept changing the game and I said, "You can't go to any other facility in the country and haggle with them over what the fee is to have access and how and when," and I said, "And treat us no differently."  So it fell off the table.  But that's not me being grandiose or bragging.  That's just me telling you how it is.  I've set out as I got wiser thanks to the ancestors to learn what to look for as to help our archives in significance and in not necessarily quantity but quality.  So we built a collection of letters.  We have thousands of letters to and from black people talking about race, politics, agriculture, holidays, death, sickness you name it.  Some very educated that can quote the classics in the letters and, you know, some from former slaves, some--I mean just--at one point I was even thinking of trying to create a center for the study of African American photographs and letters because we have so many sub collections, where you watch a family through generations in their letter writing.  That's pretty unusual, that's different.  Not trying to be Charles Blockson with the books, I'm not trying to be an Arturo Schomburg or Moorland-Spingarn [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.].  I'm not trying to be [HistoryMaker] Mayme Clayton but at the same time, I'm in love with the art of racial passing, interracial or come from an interracial background.  I've purposely gone out to try to find letters that are discussing the interracial components in the families as well as rare photographs that you could have a difficult time to discerning whether the person is mulatto or white or black or what.  Some I know from the research in the primary source material that we have, others have not a clue but the images and the contents spoke to me, and I knew it could fit into part of this collection that I wanted the archives to build.  So yeah, we have rare 78 records [78 rpm record], we've got sheet music, a huge gospel collection of Thomas Dorsey [Thomas A. Dorsey] and any of the other early black gospel pioneers in, in sheet music format.
Story_ID: 661485
Speaker 1: We have rare uniforms, World War I [WWI], World War II [WWII], Korean Wa- I mean, Vietnam War uniforms, we've got Civil War documents, thousands of photographs both professional, vernacular and amateur as well as thanks to, and I always give props to Deb Willis [HistoryMaker Deborah Willis] for enlightening me to the role of the black photographer in documenting his or her community.  So at a--in the early '90s [1990s], actually in the late '80s [1980s] I began to go out and find--I used to carry her books around too and she knows that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's well known--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --photo--
Speaker 1: I have based my ability on uncovering black photographers on the things that I learned from Deb Willis' work.  So, and she is on record as saying that there are many more black photographers that need to be uncovered, and I took that to heart and I went out and uncovered them.  So off camera we were talking about a black photographer connected to someone that The HistoryMakers just interviewed.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: We have that collection.
Speaker 2: Yeah, [HistoryMaker] Eugenia Collier's--
Speaker 1: Her husband [Collier's ex-husband, Charles S. Collier].
Speaker 2: --husband, right.
Speaker 1: We could do a retrospective on the Collier photography and countless other photographers in different cities.  But I give props to Deb.  So my collecting ability has been like this all over the place but again it's tied into the spirit.  If--right now I'm in the spirit of looking at images of slaves.  We don't know what some of these slaves looked like because they look like anybody else.  But in school we were taught for the most part that they, you know, had gnarled--and their hands were messed up and they were slew footed and were poorly dressed.  Well, what happened if you were a child slave and then you grow up and, now here is a picture of you after you have been emancipated.  Unless you do the research, primary source material through letters, oral history and other, you know, records, you could have a whole treasure trunk, a trunk full with these pictures but not know that these were former slaves.  So one of the things that I've always wanted Nanny Jack and Company [Baltimore, Maryland] to do with the archives was to help to dispel the myths about our journey and primary source, these artifacts helped me to do that.  So that's how I've been guided again by the spirit and the ancestors to go out and get certain things. Lots of times when I was acquiring stuff people are like why in the world do you want that, don't worry about it I've got a reason.  And years later oh, my goodness, look at that collection of diaries that he--his company has or look at these cancelled checks or business cards from black businesses.
Story_ID: 661486
Speaker 1: All the funeral programs or just the funeral deeds that I have from different black funeral homes where they are telling you how much the casket cost, the outfit, who the doctor of record--all this stuff now can be digitized and even sold.  See, I've always had the entrepreneurial component that I want to marry with the history and culture, the artifacts, the objects, the collections.  I don't want to give something away unless I want to give it away.  Which I do, I do charity but I get tired of companies, institutions and organizations that have funds and are getting paid that want to come to us and say, "Can you do this for free?"  We are a business, no, we cannot.  You got paid, and your job is to do this then if you want to come to us, come with some money, plain and simple.  This is a consulting firm, we are not independently wealthy, we're not a trust fund baby, we, you know, we're not backed by some huge conglomerate.  We have built this lock, stock and barrel, piece by piece over the years with blood, sweat and tears from peaks and valleys in the journey.  So, you know, a lot of organizations get upset, cut them, I cut them off up front or someone does in our company and say, "We have a fee.  This is how it works."  Especially when we are providing content that is nowhere else.  I had some person at the last minute a professor want me to stop what I was doing to talk to him about a prominent black Ph.D. that somehow he found out that we were very well skilled in, schooled in.  I said, "Not a public servant, not a library.  If you want to consult with us, there is a fee."  People get upset.  I can't wear nice suits and I can't get travel, I can't get scanners and do, you know, all the things that come along with--and pay the storage fees for the building with the stuff where the archives are housed and preservation supplies with my good looks.  Yeah, I think I'm handsome, but it's not going to pay the bills, you understand what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: This is involved, you just hit upon some- something that I was getting ready to ask you about, the cost of doing this business because you've got insurance probably, right?   You've got--
Speaker 1: It's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) storage, archival materials.
Speaker 1: It's a struggle.  All I will say to you is that it's a struggle.  There's a lot of lean time, there's a lot of lean time, and we are constantly in the quest mode for forming successful, financial, educational partnerships or coming up with the right formula to move us forward.  Speaking fees help.  When I get nice fees to do a power point at a conference, at a university, at a convention or somewhere--that helps.  I don't like doing appraisals, they are very difficult, a whole lot of work and normally we end up losing money because we put more hours into it than we bill them because the people can't afford the billable rate.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do people often bring you items for appraisal?
Speaker 1: Do they?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Does it happen often?
Speaker 1: I reject a lot of them.  (Laughter) I can't--most of the time I can't answer, I can't even answer the emails or phone calls because we can't.  I think because we have been blessed to be on national TV and in publications and this and that, the people think we are bigger than we are and everybody wants you.  They don't want to talk to anybody else, they don't want to talk to any of our interns, they don't want to talk to any associates they just want to talk to Philip [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill].  Philip can't talk to everybody especially when they are all around the country even if I have a 1-800 number and so forth.  Time is money, knowledge is money, and they get so excited to tell you, "Oh, I have this."  In the early days, I was excited to talk to them. Now unless you're willing to pay the fee, I'm not that interested in talking to you, this is a business.  You can't take your car to the mechanic, where you know the mechanic charges a hundred bucks [dollars] an hour for labor, and walk in there and say, "Well, you know, my gasket just blew, my head gasket blew, and I don't want to pay you your fee," (laughter).  They are going to laugh you out of there.  That's where I am but that's the business component.  If you want to rent an item from our archives you pay the fee.  I'm sorry, this is what the fee is.
Speaker 2: And that covers the insurance of the item and all that (unclear)?
Speaker 1: It covers any and everything you can think of.  Even for instance when we rent images to magazines they want to scan it in a certain dpi [dots per inch].  Well, you've got to have a nice scanner to get the print quality that they want.  You know, so one thing leads to another, leads to another.  It all causes you to have a fee that people just think that oh, well, they should just be willing to, you know, you help me out.  I--now I'm giving a talk for the first time at the Reginald F. Lewis Museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History and Culture, Baltimore, Maryland] in the fall, tied into the Kinsey Collection [Kinsey African American Art and History Collection] that's going to be on display there.  They asked me to talk about the art of collecting from slavery to the civil rights with a Maryland base, but I'm going to have a lot of Maryland but some other things as well.  I gave them my discounted fee, and they had a problem with that.  I said, "Well, no offense, take it or leave it, you know.  I'm already discounting you the fee," and I try to tell people the more accolades and the more credentials that I get the higher (laughter) my fee becomes.  The more shows I'm on, the more books, the more writing, the more whatever, my fee will increase because of the, of, you know, you're not dealing with just anybody, you're dealing with Philip J. Merrill of Nanny Jack and Company [Baltimore, Maryland], whoever he is, if you see what I'm saying to you?
Story_ID: 661487
Speaker 1: Does the educational community like use a lot of phot- I mean, I remember, you know, when I was going to school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Shakes head) No, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: --we had a lot of stuff from Bettmann Archive in all our history books, you know, and the (unclear) Bettmann Archive.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Otto Bettmann was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: But, you know who owned Bettmann's arch- you know who purchased that don't you?
Speaker 1: I don't.
Speaker 2: Gates [Bill Gates].
Speaker 1: Did he?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's a, it's a huge collection that--but I would like to rent more images because it's simple money, it's easy money.  You know, if it's just sitting in storage (laughter), I would love to be able to rent it and get a fee.  You know, one particular book through the University of Kentucky press [University Press of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky] dealing with fraternities and sororities, they wanted a whole bunch of images but they could only afford three.  So I gave them three but, you know, it's all about dissemination of information and allowing the public to know that your company is here, and you have some different content than the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.], than the Bettmann Archives, than the Getty archives [Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles, California], than Corbis [Corbis Images], than the big multizillion dollar ones that are out there.  We're offering you a different perspective on blacks in the [U.S.] military because of the images that we own or the letters that we own or the uniforms or whatever.  So it's all about trying to shake (laughter) the dust off your shoes from being a collector to being a businessperson, to being a historian where you get paid to consult on projects, to speak in documentaries, to lead tours, to get paid to freelance or to write articles.  So people want to pigeonhole you and put you in a box.  They want to sell you their collector as one of the hats I wear.  That's the hat that allows me to do those other things is the fact that I did start this archives.  We are a business.  I don't want to just talk to anybody for the sake of talking.  We are working, I'm behind on the 'Black, Blind, Brilliant' book ['Black, Blind and Brilliant' (ph.)] because of a myriad of other things that have come up.  But I always have to try to earn a living.  So sometimes I could be deep in the throes of a project that is non funded but that has the end result of funds, but I've got to stop that when the paid gig comes up, which could be an appraisal for a client that is donating a collection to the new national African American museum [National Museum of African American History and Culture, Washington, D.C.] that Dr. Lonnie Bunch [HistoryMaker Lonnie Bunch] and crew are handling with the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.].  We did a magnificent slave paper collection just unbelievable from one white family.  But, you know--
Speaker 1: Well, what did, did it include ledgers and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, ledgers and documents (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) rosters.
Speaker 2: --from the 1830s on up from one family.  One white family that owned them that--so you could just see all types of intimate activities with regard to the various slaves that this one family had through thirty something years before the Civil War ended.  Just fascinating, you know, but at the same time, the biggest excitement of an appraisal that we did was with the Montague collection.  There's a YouTube clip that we did.  It was also on ABC News [KTNV-TV] in Las Vegas [Nevada] and written up in TheGrio [thegrio.com] and written up in--on cnn.com's website.  So it got a lot of press with regard to trying to save the collection and me speaking about significance of what Magnificent Montague collected during his fifty some years of putting his collection together.  Recently in The New York Times, there was an article about Louis Draper, a black photographer who is a part of the Kamoinge group [Kamoinge Workshop].  We evaluated his images for UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] for the, for his sister [Nell Draper-Winston], and they were being housed at UVA about three or four years ago.  It's kind of ironic, the suggestions that we offered them are now coming to fruition, but we're not a part of that game and we're the ones that said to them, "Let's look at books and all these other things that could come out of thousands of slides and prints that Louis Draper photographed during his very important underappreciated photographic career."  So again from being a collector, it's led me to being able to do appraising, it's led me to write, to be deemed a historian, to do all kinds of things that in my wildest dreams I never thought that I'd be doing.
Story_ID: 661488
Speaker 1: Do you have any competition in the African American community today in terms of spe- specifically with what you're doing as an appraiser and--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know because I'm linear in scope.  I can't be worried about what anyone else is doing.  I try to look like this like a horse with blinders on. I'm sure, I'm sure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm just trying to get a feel for what the field was like and if (unclear)--
Speaker 2: The field, the field is predominately white.  The field is a cutthroat field.  I went in not understanding that, I got my little black feelings hurt and stepped on by the white man, by the cutthroat appraisers, evaluators, auctioneers connected to the 'Antiques Roadshow,' by the people that go to these big auctions.  I had no idea.  I was like salmon trying to swim the wrong direction in the, in the water.  Because I went in because of passion and love and trying to, and quickly, quickly got my feelings hurt.  But that helps to make that, that helped to make me who I am today.  My feelings don't get hurt publicly anymore.  Privately they might, but publicly I wear the mask.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wear the pioneering mask because people underestimate how difficult it is being the only black person appraising for the number one show on PBS [Public Broadcasting Service].  They don't understand that.  The dynamics of that, they just don't get it because in essence you're being, I'm being Jackie Robinson in baseball but doing this for the show that 14 million people see on PBS.  When Dan Rather interviewed me for '60 Minutes,' he spent the most time talking to me.  By the time it aired on '60 Minutes,' I got the least amount of time, that's because of editing.  But off air he said, "You need your own show."  But when I went back to the green room--when I went back to eat with the fellow people from the show, they got up and moved from the other table and wouldn't sit next to me because they thought I was--in their words they said, "You're butt buddies with Dan now, huh?"  I said, "What?"  See, it was okay as long as little independent [HistoryMaker] Philip Merrill, Nanny Jack and Company [Baltimore, Maryland] is not getting any publicity.  People were lining up at the shows to come see me.  It started off where we didn't even have a black memorabilia table.  I shared with collectibles.  I had to fight tooth and nail to get my own category.  That's pioneering, that's the struggle, that's the spirit.
Story_ID: 661489
Speaker 1: Tell us something about the quantity and nature of your inventory?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, it, it runs the gambit.  Rare books, photographs, letters, sheet music, 78 records [78 rpm record], dolls, toys, an extensive black hair care department, hot combs, pomade, diplomas from black beauty schools and so forth, a strong education, Jim Crow education department, diplomas, report cards, textbooks from the segregated schools with the stamp of the name of the school inside, homework assignments.  I'm just trying to think--Masonic--we have a strong mutual benefit society, benevolent society collection from the Elks [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks of the World], Knights of Pythias, Knights of Templar [Knights Templar], Green Knight Order of Hope [ph.].  Earlier I talked about the Sons and Daughters, Brothers of Moses [Grand United Order of Brothers and Sisters, Sons and Daughters of Moses], ones that you can't even think of, the Odd Fellows [Independent Order of Odd Fellows], just all kinds of badges, photographs, bylaws, a strong KKK [Ku Klux Klan] department with hoods, robes, photographs.  Their bible is called the Kloran.
Speaker 1: The Kloran?
Speaker 2: Yeah, K-L-O- yeah, you've got to laugh.  It's a joke for real.  So we have an extensive KKK department that I've worked very diligently over the years to get original stuff.  They have female members of the Klan that people don't know about.  So the husband can be a member, the wife could join and there is a junior Klan for the children.  So it really could be a family--
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about collecting this material?
Speaker 2: Yeah, of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I can't imagine you going into someplace--
Speaker 2: Of course I got one great story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: A dear friend of mine who was a Civil War reenactor for 'Glory,' he was a white gentleman, he since died.  He called me one day, he said, "Philip [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill], Philip, I found a KKK robe for you at an antique show."  I said, "Well, okay, I've already got one but give me the number and I'll call them."  I called the man very nervously and sheepishly on the phone, and in my naivete I say, "Excuse me, are you racist," (laughter)?  That's one of the first things out of my mouth, I said to him, "Are you racist?"  He says, he says, "No, listen to me, I'm a born again Christian, I'm a recovering alcoholic, and I work with youth.  I am, I cannot be further from being a racist."  I said, "Okay (makes sound), good.  I feel better now.  How much are you selling your robe for and tell me about it?"  He said, "Well, I have a hood, robe, gloves and a case that it came in.  I'm selling for one price."  I said, "Okay," I said, "now I can't afford that right now but I can give you the money on a certain date."  He said, "No problem.  I'll hold it for you."  The certain date comes along I call him, I say, "I'm ready."  He said, "No problem," he says, "Meet me at this parking lot."  So I tell mom [Betty Jackson Merrill] and dad [George Merrill], I said, "Mom and dad, listen, if I don't call you within a half hour, send the police, send the police," because I'm concerned even though he said on the phone he was not a racist.  My spirit was good with him, we vibed, I felt okay but you never know.  I get to the parking lot, he had a little boy with him, could not have been kinder, make the exchange, buy it.  You know, he told me, "God bless you and blah, blah, blah," and that was that.  I get home and I look at it closely and I realize that it's in a case like a pillow case but with a snap on the top of it, and it all fit in there very nicely.  As a matter of fact, for many years when I go into some of the schools, I put it back in the case and let the children touch it and try to guess what it is, none of them ever guess.  But anyway there were some initials on the inside of the casing.  So I called the man back and he says, "You know, let me call the people that I acquired this from because this was hidden in a secret compartment in a bureau, a dresser drawer, a piece of furniture."  So he called the lady, and the lady had to sit down because the lady had no idea that her brother was an active KKK member.  Isn't that a fabulous story?  So you just never know over the years if brother, sister, father, cousin whoever is a member of the KKK.  My other quick KKK story was, I was going to an antique store in the historic district and a white gentleman who ran the store said, "What are you looking for today?"  I said, "Unusual black Americana.  Anything that's not the run of the mill."  He said, "Well, I have what is known as a KKK bible but it's not here, would you want it?"  I said, "What?  A bible?"  He said, "Yeah, it spells out all the laws, regulations, rules and so forth."  I said yes.  So time went by, and I thought nothing of it.  Lo and behold the man called me and said, "I found it. You still want it?"  I said yeah.  Went back down to the store, he had it there, and I purchased it.  Now the reason why I wanted the bible--and it's K-L-O-R-A-N.
Speaker 1: The Kloran?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the reason why I wanted it was that I had a 1920 something letter that several KKK members were being expelled from the KKK, and I wanted to know why.  Well, when you open up this--their bible it gives you all their rules and regulations and covenants, and I could look up what this code was to find out why these men in Pennsylvania were being removed from the Klan.  Isn't that fascinating?
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: So you just never know, never know.  So those are just two interesting KKK stories.
Story_ID: 661490
Speaker 1: Back to the collection, we have all kinds of things that you don't even think of as being collecting worthy.  Yearbooks, nursing--I don't even know what you call it, the black nurses would wear, the old fashion hat that they would have.  Invitations to segregated parties, 16 [16mm] and 8mm film that was done during the '60s [1960s] and the '50s [1950s] by black families that today is content.  You could use that for a documentary.  You could use that for a story.  So we have all aspects, postmortem shots that obviously Van Der Zee's book ['The Harlem Book of the Dead,' James Van Der Zee] makes people think that he was the only one doing postmortem shots, but the various white and black photographers all across America were taking postmortem images.  Children's toys, children at play, I mean think of something and I could probably tell you that we have some component of it in the archives.  So it does run the gambit, it even surprises me.  It's like Christmas every day when I go into the various storage facilities looking for one specific thing, inevitably I get sidetracked because I'm like oh, my gosh, I forgot about this.  I used to know (snaps fingers) what everything was but as the thousands (gesture) became more thousands, it's not humanly possible, and I'm constantly in need of trying to catalog and get on top of the collections.
Speaker 2: Can you maintain it all in one storage facility?
Speaker 1: No, you cannot, you cannot.  I'm in several.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: I'm hoping that one day I can have some structure built that we own that the content can be in under one roof.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That would make me happy and that's what we are striving toward.
Story_ID: 661491
Speaker 1: Now I did not ask you about--well, I need to ask you from beginning to end what happened with 'Antiques Roadshow'?  What happened from beginning to the end of that relationship (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  The 'Antiques Roadshow' is a blessing.  How often do you get to do what you love and be seen by 14 million people in America?
Speaker 1: Now this is--you get involved from what year?
Speaker 2: Now roughly the--maybe '96 [1996], '97 [1997], when it first starts.
Speaker 1: And you ended your relationship in 2001, I believe.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'm forever documented on their website and reruns and I'm a part of the history of the 'Antiques Roadshow,' especially since I gave them the category of black memorabilia.  Before me there was no category for that.  I was just placed in collectibles.  I started off with the show doing, doing what they called B row where I go and talk about some artifacts.  One of my dear friends, Dr. Gladys-Marie Fry, a noted quilter and a professor at University of Maryland, College Park [Maryland], where I had lectured in her upper division class before, brought in a rare quilt to be appraised at the College Park show.  I did that appraisal with one of their famous Keno brothers [Leigh Keno and Leslie Keno] and I actually was able to teach Gladys about her own quilt.  That was the, that was my first time being on the 'Roadshow.'  It was an unbelievable experience.  The people were not expecting for a black person to be there, and I felt the tension.  It was not just me.  I felt it coming from them.  I'm pretty good at maneuvering the different racial climates, so it was really them and not me.  The producers asked would I like to travel with the show and my first reaction was great what would my salary be?  There is no salary so then I wasn't interested in becoming a regular person, meaning that if we travelled eight cities during the summer then I would have to pay to fly to those eight different cities, stay in a hotel, eat, drink and everything else out of my pocket.
Speaker 1: So they wouldn't, they wouldn't--were not--
Speaker 2: Read my lips (gesture).
Speaker 1: Nothing.
Speaker 2: Read my lips, nothing.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now if you are backed by Sotheby's, Christie's or any of the big auction houses, it's in their best interest to have their auction workers there, they back you.  The food expense alone--sometimes dinner would be hundreds of dollars when we go out and eventually it would be little Nanny Jack and Company's [Baltimore, Maryland] turn to foot the bill.  I paid because I could not be a Minnie the Moocher and allow the big dogs to carry me when we went out to dinner after the show all the time.  So in different cities, you know, in one city Larry [Larry Crowe] pays, Matt [Matthew Hickey] pays at another time, blah, blah.  Eventually five cities later it's going to be Philip's [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill] turn.  So, you know, when you're eating steak and drinking expensive wine and smoking expensive cigars the tab could be five, six hundred dollars.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) these are collectors, connoisseurs and such, right?
Speaker 2: These are--no, these are the talent from the show.  These are the auction people, the evaluators, the appraisers.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So these are guys with expensive taste is what I'm saying (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and these are guys that have been in the business too, of buying and selling.  Unlike me who is not a seller, who is new to this and excited, but I'm getting schooled quickly.  It's like a young Dr. J [Julius Erving] taking me to the hoop dunking all over me in the NBA [National Basketball Association], okay.  So the interest was definitely there.  I began to see some benefits of traveling with the show of expanding my professional base, learning how to speak quickly and say what you need to say in a short span of time in front of a live camera.  I also learned to hone my ability as a storyteller because I was most interested in the stories connected and behind the artifacts and less with regard to the evaluation of (laughter) the objects or artifacts.  I also got to see parts of America that I may not have gone to.  It was nice to go to New Orleans [Louisiana] and be written up in the paper.  It's nice to go to Oklahoma, right and learn more about the Black Wall Street [Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma] and riots and this and that.  I mean, you know, it was nice to go to Charleston [South Carolina] and these different places.  So in, in every aspect of life there is a good and a bad.  So there was a lot of good that I learned and that I gave to the road show.
Story_ID: 661492
Speaker 1: Some of the bad, the inability to take content to air with the frequency that I would like because the producers were concerned about the stereotypical racist content.  They were concerned about this and that but at the same time that's a part of the landscape.  When you deal with black Americana, memorabilia, and material culture, you have racist, painful but you also have powerful, positive, uplifting but you need to be able to tell the complete story and not just one fragment of it.  So, you know, you need to have the 'Ten Little Niggers' book ['And Then There Were None,' Agatha Christie] on there, just like you need to have the Romare Bearden painting that I evaluated or you need to have the James Price Johnson [James P. Johnson] collection, it was the father's stride piano collection to come on there.  At the same time you might want to look at some slave document or something.  See, so in my mind, it's all a part of our, of the American experience and we need to show it.  So it began to get increasingly difficult to show the stuff that was coming in that I wanted to show even, though I now have my own category of black memorabilia that I worked long and hard to get.  So I'll never forever forget those years.  It's bitter and sweet.  It helped to make my professional career, to allow me to take that and use it as leverage to go and do other things.  I will always be identified as that pioneering person from the 'Antiques Roadshow,' even though on the Chesapeake collectible show ['Chesapeake Collectibles'], another PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] show that I do, some of the guests that come in are so excited because they remember me from the 'Antiques Roadshow.'  And when I, when I'm guest lecturing at places, you know, inevitably, no matter what the topic is that I'm lecturing on that you are paying me to talk about, there is someone in the audience that wants to ask questions about what it's like being on the 'Antiques Roadshow,' you know.  Talk to about that if you will.  So, you know, it opened the door for a lot of other history, antique related TV shows that are out today.  So, you know, I don't watch the show, I couldn't tell you what--who the host is.  I do know some of my original members are still there.  Many of them left but some of them are still there.  So they have been with the show for, you know, anywhere from ten to fourteen years which is remarkable.  Some have left due to scandal.  Some have left due to who knows what.  A couple--one dear friend died, you know, two people died.  So, you know, there are, there are a lot of reasons why the cast changes.
Story_ID: 661493
Speaker 1: I know one aspect of that show was pottery by--
Speaker 2: Dave the Slave [David Drake].
Speaker 1: --Dave the Slave, exactly.
Speaker 2: I was asked to do a collaborative piece with one of the appraisers and I wouldn't on Dave the Slave even though I know a whole lot about Dave the Slave because this person had been condescending to me on air and off.  I mean per- at the show and off the air from the show.  So the producer couldn't believe that I was rejecting an opportunity to go on air, I said, "Not interested," because I did not want to be seen in the segment with this condescending racist person, who to this day is still that way.  So, you know, I'm not trying to sell my soul for some air time.  You know, but if you are spending your own money flying to a city, you really want to be seen filmed in that particular city if not, what did you gain from appraising at that particular city from first thing in the morning 'til four o'clock in the afternoon.  All day long you are there and you didn't get anything you could take to air, you see what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I--because of the 'Roadshow' ['Antiques Roadshow'], I got to go to Georgia to meet probably the largest private collector of Dave the Slave pottery, a very wealthy white couple that I had to hug it when I went into their house.  I mean I've never been that close other than at the 'Roadshow' to this much Dave the Slave pottery, just unbelievable, you know.  So it opened my eyes to so many aspects of antiques, of business, of TV, of travel.  I mean, there are so many components of all the staff that's needed, to the volunteers, to the paid people, to interacting with the public.  You got to put that good face on when you are tired of people coming up trying to tell your stories, and their stories aren't that exciting, or they've got a piece of crap.  You got to let them down easy.  So I learned a lot about honing my people, history, antique, media skills from travelling to those shows.  When people lined up back in the old days before they had differential times when you would come in, people would be lined up around the block for hours to get in, you know.
Story_ID: 661494
Speaker 1: Is there any other black craftsman from the enslaved period that is known like Dave [David Drake] is?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, not pottery but for other things.  The field is called African American decorative arts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Decorative arts could mean a black furniture maker, like Thomas Day.  I got to look at a Bible that came from the Thomas Day family.  I showed the descendants information in that family Bible that it did not even know existed.  When I was doing an evaluation for the Bible that they ultimately loaned to a museum in North Carolina [North Carolina Museum of History, Raleigh, North Carolina] for a huge exhibit on Thomas Day's furniture, it's magnificent.  There are silversmiths that made silver.  I mean, anything you can think of that a white craftsman did guess what, free black or enslaved blacks did too.  So the issue is identifying their marks.  How can you determine Larry Crowe's work from Bob Crowe, Larry's black, Bob is white.  What is indicative of Larry's that shows you this is black, even if it's not signed?  Is it symbolism there, is the motif for something that lets you know.  So there is pottery, there is furniture, there's textiles, there's silver, there's even brick makers.  Think about this, in Pennsylvania, I've been researching lately this black brick maker.  Go figure, when you think about buildings that were made during the antebellum period and after, you're not even thinking in your mind that a black person made these bricks.  What are the marks that would allow you today, fifty, seventy, a hundred or more years later to determine that these mark, that these bricks were made by this black company?  See, so anything that you can think of.  Memory jugs that are very southern based were a huge industry.  You know, so by travelling with the 'Roadshow' ['Antiques Roadshow'] my eyes, my base of learning was just totally expanded, totally because I was interested in other things that walked in the door that I thought I had what I call crossover appeal, it's kind of like an artist.  This item could go to the--my table which is black memorabilia or it could go to the biblio- the book table, it could go to the textile table, it could go to the silver table.  So I was always trying to glom onto what was going on at the other tables and when I had a lull, I was over there listening and learning.  Because I could say, "Wait a minute that really belongs over here because I can give it a bigger bounce because in your world you're not that excited about it.  Because it's just--but in my world, you know I can name other black cabinet makers but most people can't.  They don't even know what they, they don't even know what they look like."  You know, so that led me to start doing directory research.  All across the country there are these directories, and the directories is often a segment in the back during the antebellum period where there would be free people of color.  It would give you their name, address and occupation.  So if I see a name and an address and it says silversmith, I'm like oh, my gosh.  Now I've uncovered a black silversmith.  So, now I want to go and see if I can find some of their examples of their work, you see what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Pretty deep, pretty deep.
Story_ID: 661495
Speaker 1: Yeah, intuitively as I listen to you, I'm thinking and tell me if I'm right here that say you have two comparable silversmiths from the same period, say the 1820s, one is white, one is black.  I would just think intuitively that the black man's work would be worth more because he's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There you go.
Speaker 1: --rarer than the white one.
Speaker 2: Case in point, exactly.  But to prove that is very difficult.  Because, again as I stated earlier, where are the comps from auction houses, where is the scholarly research and papers or any, where has any of this been exhibited?  Often you are doing ground breaking, pioneering research and collecting and evaluating.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) the aspect of branding, the pottery of Dave [David Drake] because people know Dave.
Speaker 2: Plus the books out, Larry [Larry Crowe].  The books on him, there have, there have been exhibits.  Also, if I could let's look at the Gullah Geechee with the baskets, whole 'nother interest, field.  Because of the environment and grass isn't growing as much and land is being taken and the young children don't want to do it.  There's a huge amount of interest in this Gullah Geechee connection.  You know, in Florida, North Carolina, in Georgia and South Carolina.  So if you're smart, why not become an expert in the material culture of that, of that whole Gullah Geechee thing, okay, because it's a lot of room for interpretation for all of their practices.  From their language, to their clothing, to their food, to their funerary, I mean just wide open.  So naturally I'm saying, yes, if I have a choice to compare a letter from someone as rare as Zora [Zora Neale Hurston] to let the white person do it and I'm not saying this in a racist way but often they're not going to put the same amount or interest on it as I would because to them it's not, it's not quite that important.  Do you see what I'm saying?  So that's why when the Paul Laurence Dunbar books came in or when a Solomon, Solomon Northup book came in or any of the black books, I wanted the book people to let me have them because to them, they are going to look at the condition, the foxing, the age marks, the this, the that. I'm like but wait a minute this is an 1845 narrative of Frederick Douglass.  It doesn't surface that often.  Or this is some other rare book.  Let's put it in context.  Take it out of the bibliophile Americana field and put it in the black Americana field.  So that was part and parcel of the experiences with the 'Roadshow' ['Antiques Roadshow'] that have now morphed into the Chesapeake collectible show ['Chesapeake Collectibles'] as well.
Story_ID: 661496
Speaker 1: I get the feeling we are surrounded by valuable items that we--
Speaker 2: Don't know.
Speaker 1: --don't know about.
Speaker 2: But I will say in defense of the modern day antique person that comes to the shows, they know more about their content than ever before.  And often we as the so called experts are stumped because we can't tell them anything that they don't already know, which at the, at the recent taping of the Chesapeake collectible show ['Chesapeake Collectibles'] for PBS [Maryland Public Television] several of the people were upset with some of the appraisers because they said, "You're the expert, I've come here for you to tell me something about it and you can't tell me anything."  Well, that's the nature of the beast.  You've owned this, you've already researched it to death, I can't tell you anything that you don't already know.  I--one person (laughter), I won't say what the item was, but they passed it on to my table, and I don't do African and I get very upset when--it happened at the 'Roadshow' ['Antiques Roadshow'] and it happens at the Chesapeake collectible, when people bring me African or Native American or some western, Samoan or Maori or Filip- or whatever that's out of my real house.  I do black Americana, I do content of when you landed here in America.  There's a big difference.  I don't know what any of this other stuff looks like.  And, so the generalist, who is very skilled as an appraiser, he--a top appraiser--he sent the person over to me, and the person got mad at me, and I said, "Well, time out a minute."  I said, "Hold the phone.  First of all, this is out of my expertise.  I apologize that you were brought to my table but I got to take you back over there because I can't help you."  You should never be so knowledgeable that you can't admit to someone that you don't know.  I'll be the first to tell you, I don't know.  I don't talk just to hear myself talk and I don't bill myself as the expert in everything.  There's going to be content after content that surfaces that I know nothing about.  Now I'll be willing to try to figure out something for her but sometimes I can't.
Story_ID: 661497
Speaker 1: When you look back over everything you've done to this point, is there anything that you would do differently if you could change something?
Speaker 2: Everything with the 'Roadshow' ['Antiques Roadshow'], everything period in this journey with the Nanny Jack and Company [Baltimore, Maryland] and history.
Speaker 1: Nanny Jack, period, career, period.
Speaker 2: Yes, I would be more self-confident, develop a thicker skin, be less willing to be detoured from the course.  In other words, I would stay the course, stick within the mission, the vision and not be enticed by dangling carrots or become partner with this group or do this or do that when what we really should be doing is, the gold is in the archives and we should be mining that gold on a regular basis.  For books, for apps [application program], for tours, for children's books, for mini documentaries, for rental, for anything because somebody said he who has content is king.  We're king, but we haven't figured out how to really benefit from being the king.  So we have all this rich content but it's a constant struggle to monetize it.
Story_ID: 661498
Speaker 1: Is there any association of African American appraisers and collectors?
Speaker 2: Two different things (gesture).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Appraisers is one, collectors is another.  At one point I was a part of the Black Memorabilia Collectors' Association that Jeanette Carson started with the magazine [Black Ethnic Collectibles] in the, in the '90s [1990s].  I even went up to New York for a big meeting to possibly become the president, the meeting went nowhere and I distanced myself because it was a bunch of mess.  Personalities, egos, territorial and they missed the boat.  To this day, there should be some type of thriving black Americana collectors association that could act as an advocacy, reference, resource or something for the tons of private collections and institutional collections that are in need of help.  Sometimes I won't even touch a potential appraisal gig which would put money in our pocket because I'm so overwhelmed by what it is that they are putting out there.  Just thousands of pieces that, you know, how in the world could we, you know, but there is no place to go.  Not every collection is worthy of being donated to the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.].  They have space issues, they got financial issues and they have content focus and issues.  The public doesn't want to understand that.  Repositories at colleges, at other museums also have those same constraints and so forth.  So a lot of places want to cherry pick a collection.  And I've tried to represent some clients that have magnificent collections, but they don't want it to be broken up.  And the places that would be willing to accept the donation want to break them up.  So, you know, without naming names, I know of two major collections tied into two deceased New York collectors that I shudder to think what ultimately has happened and will happen to their priceless collection of many decades.
Story_ID: 661499
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done at this point, what, what today would you consider to be your legacy as a professional?
Speaker 2: My legacy as a professional would be pioneering a new way.  Making my own road, not trying to do it the way a museum does it, not trying to do it the way a library does it but to do it the way Philip J. Merrill [HistoryMaker Philip Merrill] and his supporting casts see fit, which is to be an independent.  You know, to build a one of a kind archive that you can utilize to disseminate information and to earn a living from your own company's content.  I get tired when I give a talk somewhere and someone says, "Oh, you're like a little Schomburg [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg]," no, I'm not.  I'm like a little Philip J. Merrill, head of Nanny Jack and Company [Baltimore, Maryland].  Oh, you do what [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson does, no, I don't.  Blockson collected largely books and pamphlets and some photographs and ephemera but Blockson also did it at a time when the stuff was much cheaper and more prevalent, which was a blessing.  You know, today to amass what he did--who could afford it, who could afford it, okay.  I have a great deal of respect for any of the earlier collectors, bibliophiles, whatever dealers you want to call them, no animosity, no hatred.  I'm not trying, I wasn't trying to be them.  I didn't model myself after them.  In some cases I didn't even know about them until well into my journey.  I also know that from learning from some of them, they have not been the most helpful to other people that were coming along, where I try to help and bring along other people.  When you realize that wherever you are, you did not get there by yourself.  I keep that in the forefront of my mind when some person wants to learn about something or they want to do this and I think about the negative experiences that I've had when trying to communicate with a Charles Blockson or trying to talk to some of these other so called giants that clearly at some point have heard of my name.  And I'm not saying that in an arrogant way, I'm just saying it in a factual way.  You don't get written up in New York Times [The New York Times] and all, and Black Enterprise and a myriad of other publications that I'm been written up in and on, and you haven't heard of my name and then when I contact you and I use somebody else's name that you know intimately and says, "Look, talk to this person," and you still don't, I have a problem with that.  It's not a jealousy problem, it's a problem of reaching back and helping the fellow person along, which in the black community we seem to have lost track of that.  During Jim Crow, we wouldn't have made it without helping each other.  And today we don't help each other like we should, and I say that with the utmost sincerity in my voice and in my facial expressions.  It pains me to this day that the jealousy, the ego, the territorial, the envy--this isn't about us, this is about our history, our heritage, our legacy, our story.  It's about the ancestors and what they did to allow us to do what we are trying to do today.
Story_ID: 661500
Speaker 1: In terms of mentorship, I know you mentioned interns before working with you.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Do you have a process for that, how does that occur?
Speaker 2: Sometimes the universities contact us, sometimes I've done--been giving a lecture and some of the faculty want to know is there any possible way that their students could intern with us.  We've had high school, undergrad and graduate students intern with us.  People don't understand that interns require a lot of attention and work, you know.  It's that bitter with the sweet kind of thing.  You can get some quality work done, but also you've got to have a quality amount of handholding to get certain things done.  So I've had some really sharp interns from some universities and some that I couldn't wait for the time to end and I helped them pass the class because (laughter) they needed it to graduate.  So the internships are to be taken seriously today.  It's not just oh, well, I'm going to come and work with Nanny Jack and Company [Baltimore, Maryland] and do nothing, you know.  You've got to show up, put in the hours and do whatever you agree when we sign the contract with your school or university or college to do.  So there is an end, end result, a product.
Story_ID: 661501
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Some of my hopes and concerns for the African American community go back to home, it goes back to home.  I wish we could rejoice, celebrate, recognize the impact that our home life has played historically on us and America.  Today your name means nothing.  Back in the day, oh, you are old man Crowe's boy. That meant everything, that opened the door for you, that stopped you from getting a beating, that got you a job, that got you a date, that got you everything because you came out of the Crowe house. We've lost that.  I want us to also be more in tuned to the ability to overcome obstacles.  My company slogan is know history, know self [Nanny Jack and Company, Baltimore, Maryland].  If some of the young folks today knew their history just maybe some of them would treat each other in the larger community a little bit better.  When you begin to learn about the constant level of degradation and frustration and beatings and lynchings and rape and all just pillage so much negativity, but we survived it.  We survived it through prayer, through coming together as a people, even though we always have dissension and fraction, which we still do but we had a sense of self that we don't have today.  And I, and I just pray that sometimes when I give a lecture, write an article, do a TV segment that it sparks something in some young black person to say, "Boom, I get it.  I'm now going to pull up my pants, I'm going to change my hair style, I'm going to act differently in front of my elders.  Sit at the foot of that elder instead of ignoring them."  You know, so I get that not only from my house, from Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson] but I do oral history on a weekly basis and I have been doing it for years (laughter).  I have countless video and different formats and audio.  (Laughter) Lately I've been interviewing a Korean War veteran once a week, fascinating stories.  I've gotten him so excited about history, he wanted to die, widow, not computer active.  Now got him a computer, he's all excited, he researches, he--not drinking as much as he used to.  He's visiting libraries and repositories researching, all because I was blessed to be able to spark an interest within him through history.  See, so history can be healing, it can be soothing, it can be uplifting, it can be motivating.  History can play so many roles that we don't think about in helping us in present day.  It can improve race relations.  Not every black man is your brother, not every white man is your enemy.  The great Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., he once said, "I may be of your color but not your kind." That's a deep comment.  Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was quoted one day many years ago talking about how awful he felt that he was uncomfortable when he saw a group of young black men walking down the street. That's alive and well today.  What happened to black men taking their hats off when they went into buildings, or they were in the presence of a woman or how you would change your language.  I mean, so many things I hope that by showing some wonderful pictures of some well dressed black men, some well dressed women, just showing a proud family together.  You know, so much we've lost.  So that realm of collecting, of researching, of writing, of displaying, of sharing is more than just sharing, it could help to change lives.  So that's what I hope for America and I hope that what I've done and what I will continue to do will help in that vein.  I've tried diligently and to some modicum of success and sometimes other times I've fallen flat on my face, but I'm not afraid to try again and I'm not afraid of failure because this is what I'm put here to do.
Story_ID: 661502
Speaker 1: Now in terms of what you're doing next, I hear you saying you are re- refining your collection, you're focusing it, and you're working on a book too.
Speaker 2: I'm working on several books unfortunately, unfortunately.  I like to tell people over the last decade I probably have ten different books in various stages of non completion and I vacillate between the different books.  All of them are original except for--what I mean original, all of them are coming out of content in the archives except for Dave Chappelle and Dr. Yvonne Seon's story of 'Black, Blind and Brilliant: The George Raymond Reed Story' [ph.].  That's based on the artifacts that they provide for me and the research that I'm able to do in conjunction with interviewing and spending quality time with Yvonne [HistoryMaker Yvonne Seon].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just briefly, what's the--what is the story about?
Speaker 2: The 'Black, Blind and Brilliant' story is a story of overcoming blindness during Jim Crow.  This man is brilliant.  He goes to Dunbar in D.C. [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], the first black high, colored high school in America.  He graduates with honors, gets a scholarship to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], graduates magna--summa cum laude, goes on to be an advocate for other blind people with the Randolph-Sheppard Act [Randolph-Sheppard Act of 1936] that allowed blind folk to vend in various government buildings.  Today when you see a vendor at a building, you should think about George Raymond Reed.  He also was a musician, he lost in an amateur music contest to Cab Calloway but nonetheless he could tinkle the ivories, he was very good.  Had a great sense of humor, he embodied the spirit of a sighted man, and I know that sounds strange but in essence, he may not have had eyes, but I think he could see.  So you are going on a journey that's dealing with racial identity because we're confused as to was he black or white.  We are dealing with a lot of painful issues that the colored Maryland School for the Blind [Baltimore, Maryland], where he was the youngest student there.  He read every book in the library.  Some white teachers wanted to adopt him, but they couldn't.  The story goes from being born pre-World War I [WWI], going up to his death after the new millennium and the lives that he touched and his experiences as a blind man.  He was on a blind bowling team. Whoever knew there was a blind bowling league?  I can't imagine that, I mean, there is just so many things about George Raymond Reed and his zest for life that he did not allow being blind to stop him.
Story_ID: 661503
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  And you have a daughter [Indie Merrill], right?  And--
Speaker 2: Yes, that I love more than life itself.  I want her to always understand that she is a beautiful, as she calls herself, brown (laughter), beautiful brown person.  So whenever there is an opportunity to get her a book that shows some black characters in it or a doll, like a Doc McStuffins tee shirt or when Dora [Dora the Explorer] had a little princess--I can't even talk I got so excited when I'm talking about my daughter.  'Princess and the Frog' ['The Princess and the Frog'], when the series came out, I made sure that I got her the black princess stuff that's in it.  I always want her to understand that the world is a compilation of all different colors.  But don't let anyone say to you because you're brown that you're not beautiful, you're not intelligent, you're not this, you're not that because she does live and go to school in a predominantly white environment.  She is a daddy's girl.  I love her so much.  As one of my crowning legacies is that I was blessed to create a beautiful, smart, outgoing, caring human being.  And I dedicated my new children's book to her which is called 'How Princess Wee Wee Gets Her Name' [ph.] and Princes Wee Wee [Harriet Thompson] was a pioneering, black vaudevillian, for lack of a political correct term, she was a black midget who ended up dancing in front of two presidents at the White House [Washington, D.C.].  Dancing with the Whitman Sisters for years, went to Cuba, went--I mean, just a lovely story.  So I based the book on her being a tiny person and her parents not letting her out to play.  She sneaks out, they bully her and what saves her from being really bullied is that she can dance and that, after that they be- they become friends and she becomes known as Princess Wee Wee.  So what I did and the formula for this book and other children's books that we will be producing, we take historic content, have it illustrated really vividly and then in the end of the book you see the original artifacts that the story is based on.  So the end of this Princess Wee Wee book you actually see the original photographs that we've acquired over the years of Princess Wee Wee, who was a real person.  But in the illustrations, she looks like a, you know, non real person.  So I was able to have my daughter come from Connecticut to go to the museum and to see on the walls in the museum a book that is dedicated to her and at some point on the website I have her reading--I've already filmed it.  Have her reading part of the book and she actually went to the museum and stood up on this big ruler where you can measure your height against Princess Wee Wee's height.  So, you know, how it cool is it when your dad can write a book and can be dedicated to you and you're young enough to read it and share it with your friends and so forth, pretty cool.
Speaker 1: I'd say so.
Speaker 2: So if at the end of the day, I'm not fortunate to have any other children, I will have at least had one that I know that I'm doing everything that I can to make sure she values the legacy of the African American experience and what her father's family has been through, what they are going through and, and so forth.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything we have not raised that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's in the bio but I just wanted to elaborate on it quickly.  I was very excited to be selected as a member of the Open Society Institute [Open Society Foundations].  I was one of about two hundred applicants that applied.  So eight people were accepted to receive a chunk of money to create a project, and we created a project that is mislabeled in their catalog but nonetheless.  There is a Know History, Know Self program, where we went into a historic black middle school in a seventh grade class and three days a week in a social studies class, we had a hands on program with the students to teach them about family, community and school history.  Each one of those students left there with their own DVD [digital video disc] that we helped them put together with regard to their family history.  Each one of those students had a greater sense of appreciation of the dilapidation and decay in the historic Old West Baltimore community [Old West Baltimore Historic District, Baltimore, Maryland].  When they would walk to and from school now, they had no idea of all the prominent people that lived, worked and played in their community because of the state that it's in as we speak.  Each one of those students had a greater sense of the legacy of historic Booker T. Washington Junior High School [Booker T. Washington Middle School for the Arts, Baltimore, Maryland], where Bill Kenny of The Ink Spots matriculated.  Where I had them meet the World War II [WWII] veteran that I did a World War II book about the Alcan Highway [Alaska Highway].  William Griggs [William E. Griggs], he was ninety and these seventh graders asked, "What does it feel to be ninety, what does it feel like?   I've never met someone ninety.  What was it like to be in World War II?  Did you really walk these halls in the '30s [1930s]?"  The answer was yes, he did all that.  We prepared them to do oral history.  Some of those students were so moved that I invited them downtown to a public hearing when I was a commissioner for historical architectural preservation appointed by mayor and city council [Baltimore City Council], where they could testify in front of strangers as to why a historic building in their community should be saved.  That kind of work needs to be done all across the country where you reach the young folk.  Where they now see history is not boring.  They see how it affects and is related to them.  They also see that it can monetized.  None of them think about growing up to be a historian, a preservationist, an architect, a researcher, a writer.  But when you put original objects in front of them, they went wild.  You know, we had original items from the history of Booker T. Washington, the school.  When we started naming the prominent people in the community and that went on to great things, they had no idea, no idea.  See, so history doesn't have to be boring to these young African American children, and it pains me that when I go to white schools they love our history more than we do, and they know it more than we do.  So that is something that is near and dear to me that we are able to in some way impact the younger generation.  Fifty years from now, if--God willing, I'll be a hundred or let's just say thirty years from now, I can't imagine me wanting to sing some Little Wayne songs or Jay-Z songs.  But fifty years from now somebody still--or thirty years might still want to listen to The Ink Spots or listen to a whole bunch of other quality musicians that came out of that era.  What will be the future of African American history?  So, you know, that's a part of who I am and what Nanny Jack and Company [Baltimore, Maryland] is all about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  He gave his all to uplift the legacy of people of color through material culture.
Story_ID: 661505
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  So tell us about what we're looking at?
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  We're looking at an Instructo [Instructo Corporation] 'The Negro Family' game that was used during the 1960s in various school systems across the country.  What is ironic about this is that they even have a separate version for the Negro family.  You open up the box and you can't because it might fall out.  The original characters in there with instructions for them to be placed on the flannel board.  So it shows you an actual black family, and the irony again is that the cover has nothing but white students (laughter) and a white teacher on the outside.  This is a very--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You've got a table--
Speaker 2: You've got little flannel black people there.
Speaker 1: Those are the black people that are on the inside, showing the Negro family and this was used to educate both black and white students in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 1: At least there's a father in the family.
Speaker 2: Exac- well, see and that's important, that was a very positive look.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Earlier you talked about donations, this is a part of a large collection donated by the late Sonia Bontemps [Sonia Simmons Bontemps] who was married to Paul Bontemps, the son of Arna Bontemps.  That is Sonia's father, Lieutenant Ogbon Napoleon Simmons [Ogbon Simmons], an early Omega Fraternity member [Omega Phi Psi Fraternity] and a pioneering World War I [WWI] soldier that goes on to be a medical doctor for decades in the District of Columbia.  We have his photographs, letters, medical books, a sword and his original boots from World War I that are on the floor.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Ogbon?
Speaker 2: O-G- Og- B-O-N, Ogbon, middle initial N, last name Simmons, S-I-M-M-O-N-S.
Speaker 1: Simmons, okay, thank you.  Now let's see here.
Speaker 2: Interestingly enough he--I can't, I haven't researched it enough, but he did not finish at the New England School of Medicine [ph.] and ended up (background noise), ended up at the Freedmen [Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: --ended up at Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Those boots were made for walking.  Those are the original boots that belonged to Lieutenant Simmons that he used during his World War I days and in addition we have his sword, his discharge papers and other--just a fabulous story of an educated black soldier that goes on to do a lot of good work for the government as he fights in World War I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he in the cavalry with the spurs and everything?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We're now looking at a piece of folk art, or it could be identified as outsider arts.  This was created by an illiterate, elderly black man in the rural parts of Alabama.  I was in an antique store, saw a sign, saw a newspaper photocopied and a piece of his work, and I ask the dealer could I have a copy of the article.  He said yes and he said, "You know, the man is alive."  So I went on an excursion in Birmingham.  I went door to door to all these stores asking did anyone know Ernest Mostello.  A white lady at the supermarket said, "I think I know someone that knows him."  She called from the supermarket, and we drove about a half hour to forty-five minutes into some rural part of Birmingham, Alabama.  And in a trailer lived elderly, almost illiterate Ernest Mostello who talked about how his family since slavery had been making folk art and furniture.  He barely could sign his name and if you zoom in you'll see that he did sign it.  Nine out of ten pieces of his work are not signed.  I actually photographed him and audioed him so I have an additional support data to go along with his wonderful piece of folk art.
Speaker 1: Yeah, roots of the blues.
Speaker 2: Exactly, his work is all over the coun- all over the world, but largely he is under recognized and forgotten.
Speaker 1: This piece speaks to me because of the elongated figures with the, with his arms and hand and his facial expression (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 1: What's interesting is that the artist was a black gentleman who I've since researched because in acquiring his sister's collection, I was able to get this and then learn about this man who also comes from the South.  What I'm fascinated by is that many people when they retire after a long professional career turn to the arts, and this gentleman was highly educated and that's the only piece of his work that I've found, but I'm looking for more of his artwork.  I just happen to love the fact that the man is opening up a book.
Speaker 2: Can't get away from segregation within the school system.  We're in 2013 now but we're fast approaching the sixtieth anniversary of Brown v. Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] in 2014.  This is showing you a colored high school, which here in Baltimore [Maryland] went on to become known as the Frederick Douglass High School where Thurgood Marshall, Cab Calloway, Anne Wiggins Brown, who is a HistoryMaker and countless others matriculated.  It is almost on the level of historic M Street [M Street High School] and Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School] in D.C.  It opened up somewhat afterwards, but teachers had Ph.D.'s, master's degrees and who's who taught, and E. Franklin Frazier, black bourgeoisie, went to the colored high school and then came back and taught one year, historic, historic, historic.
Speaker 1: That's [HistoryMaker] Anne Brown the singer?
Speaker 2: Yes, who The HistoryMakers did, yes.  She put the Bess in 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin].
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: I helped to landmark her family's historic house here.  It's a landmark site here in Old West Baltimore [Old West Baltimore Historic District, Baltimore, Maryland] in Sandtown [Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I can't say that I was, that I remember the march in 1963 because I don't but I was very excited many years ago to acquire an original button from the March on Washington, August 28th, 1963.
Speaker 1: The two original bus tickets, how rare is it to find two original bus tickets.  These were donated by a lady who did not go and had them sitting in her house, guaranteed to be authentic.  And I can't imagine paying two dollars for a bus trip to and from Washington, D.C. for the March on Washington in 1963.
Speaker 2: And there is an original program from what was going on that day with the infamous March on Washington.
Speaker 1: We don't have to really show The Crisis, the official organ of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] but we have them going back to the early 1900s.  They're chock filled with great biographical sketches with photographs, with advertisements from black businesses.  It--they are microfilmed and digitized, so it's a blessing to go dig in them because you learn so much about black life from who graduated from what school, from invention.  It's just treasure trove of information.
Speaker 2: Now you had some personal pho- photographs too, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I can't move, I can't move.
Speaker 2: Well, here, here.
Speaker 1: I wanted to show you, I've got to show you--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: --one tied into a project where we're going to be renting some images for an exhibit.  This is a woman who was a pioneering medical doctor from Kentucky.  She's related to the late Benjamin Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks], the former NAACP leader.  This is Dr. Mary Britton, B-R-I-T-T-O-N, a very significant black female homeopathic doctor from Kentucky, 19th century, under the radar.
Speaker 2: Julian Bond's grandfather, the former slave [James Bond], (unclear), could pass for white.
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My main man.  Recent acqui- acquisition of Reverend Dr. Henry Highland Garnet.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I'm not going to show you them all.  I'm going to show you one other one.  Ohio man tied into Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], Bishop Benjamin W. Arnett, born free.
Speaker 1: Oh, Bishop Arnett, yeah.
Speaker 2: A very important person tied into black codes, tied into Wilberforce.
Speaker 1: And here's a--this is the last one.  This is another slave, this Reverend Dr. Harvey Johnson.  Harvey Johnson creates an activist group [Mutual United Brotherhood of Liberty] that is the precursor to the Niagara Movement that's not talked about often.  A very important black preacher.
Story_ID: 661506
Speaker 1: --Left we have Port of Harlem out of D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and Harlem, New York [New York] where I wrote a column called Praising the Past.
Speaker 2: That is a photo button from the late 196- early 1969 where you see Philip on the left, my mom, my young sister, Melissa and my dad.  What a picture.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We're rolling.  Go ahead.  Tell us about what we're looking at here.
Speaker 2: Well, we're looking at [HistoryMaker] Philip Merrill with a big 'fro during the '70s [1970s] in a Forest Park [Baltimore, Maryland] basketball league that is not tied into my school but a community.
Speaker 1: He's the one--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Holding the banner on the right.
Speaker 1: With the knee pads and the big 'fro.
Speaker 2: That is a very rare letter from the noted folklorist, author Zora Neale Hurston that was donated to me by a personal friend of hers.  In 1939, Morgan [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] conferred an honorary doctorate to her, and she was visiting.
Speaker 1: Earlier we talked about the signed Billie Holiday, there it is, God bless the child that's got his own ['God Bless the Child'], just magnificent, magnificent.
Speaker 2: I neglected to talk about this letter from Frederick Douglass that was donated to me in a box of countless other important material.  On his Cedar Hill, Anacostia, D.C. [Frederick Douglass National Historic Site, Washington, D.C.] letterhead in 1892, discusses anti separate coach issue pre Plessy v. Ferguson [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896] and when he was a slave and so forth.  Just chock filled with ground breaking information that could help us today (laughter), 1892.
Speaker 1: We are looking at--Lord, look at those red pants and my Jack Purcell tennis shoe.  You are looking at a picture at the valley school with Mrs. Jarmello [ph.] and the fourth grade.  There I am on the right hand side standing like a soldier (laughter), whoo.
Speaker 2: That is the love of my life, Mrs. Sunshine.   Indie, I-N-D-I-E, middle name Rose, last name Merrill, M-E-R-R-I-L-L [Indie Merrill].  Seven years old going on seventy.
Speaker 1: That happens to be my Loyola College [Loyola College in Maryland; Loyola University Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland], now university, graduation picture, look at that hairline and the earring.
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: Eighty-five [1985].
Speaker 2: On one of my many visits to Connecticut to see my daughter and showing her probably pictures of herself on my Apple computer.
Speaker 1: That's right outside the door at 5005 Edmondson Avenue in the late '70s [1970s] with Nanny Jack [Merrill's maternal great-grandmother, Gertrude Berry Jackson] as I prepare to embark on my first trip to England.
Speaker 2: There I am in front of the 1307 North Stockton Street house in 1968 in Old West Baltimore [Old West Baltimore Historic District, Baltimore, Maryland] holding my 'Rat Patrol' ['The Rat Patrol'] or G.I. Joe character.
Speaker 1: That is the other love of my life, my mother otherwise known as reverend, pastor, mom, sidekick, everything, Betty L. Merrill [Betty Jackson Merrill].
Speaker 2: Grandmother and great-granddaughter in Long Island, New York, Mary Frances Watkins [Mary Jackson Fleming] and Indie Rose Merrill at her fourth birthday.
Speaker 1: An additional picture of the little, inquisitive one, Indie Rose Merrill in her Connecticut home.
Speaker 2: There is the namesake of the business, Nanny Jack and Company [Baltimore, Maryland], that is Gertrude Jackson, take no prisoners with her hand on her hip and many people knew of her in that pose.  That is used on many of our logos.
Speaker 1: That is another original picture of her dropping a mean mug with a very stylish hairdo from that time period (laughter).
Speaker 2: I loved the Orioles [Baltimore Orioles] back then in the '70s [1970s] and I grew up going to the baseball games and there I am deep sea fishing showing off some of my haul, catch from the day.
Speaker 1: Wes Unseld at his basketball camp.  I don't know who is dropping the meaner mug Wes or Philip (laughter).  I just saw Wes the other day at a Lowe's [Lowe's Companies, Inc.] because he and his wife [Connie Unseld] operate a school [Unselds School, Baltimore, Maryland] in a nearby area.
Speaker 2: There I am in one of my favorite photographs from the department store with lots of hair and a nice smile.
Speaker 1: Four strong willed powerful women, on the left is my sister Melissa Ann Merrill Floyd [Melissa Merrill Floyd], on the bottom center is my mother, Betty L. Merrill, up top is Nanny Jack, Gertrude Jackson with no teeth in her mouth by choice and her daughter Mary Frances Watkins from Long Island, New York.
Speaker 2: That is a contemporary picture of my late father, George [George Merrill], and my loving mom, Betty.
Speaker 1: And it's in contrast to one of my all time favorite photographs from the late '60s [1960s] with mom rocking the big 'fro, dad with the big chest protector tie and just a lovely picture as he is coming home from work.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, these are copies but still.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: These are the books that--I have the originals on a table on there but it's easier just to show you--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that I think.  The first book is 'The Art of Collecting Black Memorabilia' [Philip Merrill].  Came out in 1998.  We use it when we speak at conferences.  The next book is on the right, the black American series [Black America Series] 'Baltimore' [Philip Merrill and Uluaipou-O-Malo Aiono] from Arcadia Publishing.  It's in its fifth printing.  All images and information comes from Nanny Jack and Company archives and the visitor's bureau gives away free copies to important black visitors to Baltimore [Maryland].  Up top is University of Mississippi press book, 'The World War II Black Regiment that Built the Alaskan Military Highway' ['The World War II Black Regiment that Built the Alaska Military Highway: A Photographic History,' William E. Griggs] and the images were used in the PBS 'American Experience,' 'Canadian Experience' [sic.].  And it's just a wonderful original photographs by a World War II [WWII] veteran.
Speaker 1: There I am in D.C. in the Alaska state senator's office.  He is not in that particular picture but I'm holding a certificate that the World War II veteran, Mr. Griggs [William E. Griggs], who was ninety something posing in the picture.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  In the lower right.
Speaker 1: In the lower right hand corner.
Speaker 2: There is the official--I forget his name at the moment.  He is the senator or congressman from Alaska.  There we are after signing various books and posing for pictures.  It was a distinct honor that a white relative saw the book and realized that his father was tied into it and contacted myself and Mr. Griggs and the politicians so we could have a special ceremony in Washington, D.C. to honor Mr. Griggs' great work.
Speaker 1: I love that picture because it's in Long Island at my grandmother's house and you get to see my mother's college picture from Coppin [Coppin State Teachers College; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland], you get to see Nanny Jack and you get to see Mary Frances Watkins and my sister, Melissa and my dad, George is holding his granddaughter, Indie who is not the most interested, the least interested at all in the family history.  But then again it was her fourth birthday so what do you expect.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear) know history (laughter).
Speaker 1: Exactly, other than the gifts.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear) years, I think.
Speaker 1: That is such a lovely late 1960s photograph with my dad holding my young sister, Melissa, my mom holding a dog and me with the big 'fro and my cousin who was with us at the time as well.  'Fros were definitely in back in the day as they are now as well.
Speaker 2: (Unclear), right?
Speaker 1: No, we didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There we are at the historic Booker T. Washington Junior High School [Booker T. Washington Middle School for the Arts, Baltimore, Maryland] where the students are interviewing Mr. Griggs, who was the valedictorian in the early '30s [1930s] during the Depression [Great Depression].  That's part of the Open Society Institute [Open Society Foundations] program, Know History, Know Self that was funded.
Speaker 2: I use this picture as one of my several different publicity shots.  There I am surrounded by some original slave restraints and some Madam C.J. Walker hair content, an original Jim Crow sign, Afro, 8 track tape and a few other goodies.
Speaker 1: For many years that was my logo where you see a jockey in the background and a manumission document and a ball and chain right there and that's a picture of Fiddlin' Jackson [Philip Jackson], Nanny Jack's husband.  And this is a 'Ten Little Niggers' ['And Then There Were None,' Agatha Christie], rare book on the bottom.  Again any item you see is authentic.  We don't specialize in reproductions or fake items.
Speaker 2: You mean 'Ten Little Indians' right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.  These are two magazines that I used to write a column for.  Jubilee on the right was owned and operated by The Baltimore Sun which is owned by the Tribune Publishing [Tronc, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  I had a column called Back in the Day [ph.] and on the--
