Story_ID: 29699
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Lucile Alma Collier.  It's L-U-C-I-L-E,. A-L-M-A, C-O-L-L-I-E-R.
Speaker 1: What was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Green, G-R-E-E-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Four, twenty-five, nineteen hundred [April 25, 1900].
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Stanton, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay, S-T-A-N-?
Speaker 2: -N-T-O-N, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, first of all?
Speaker 2: Actually, that's rather short because my mom had no sisters or brothers.  And we lived in a town where we had no relatives other than my grandmother [Lula Brooks].  So I never really got to meet any of the relatives on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: So are there any stories about any of them, where they came from?
Speaker 2: No, not really, no.  She was an only child, as I said.  And we just didn't get to meet any of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your grandmother was born there in Stanton [Tennessee] too as far as you know?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did your grandmother do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was an entrepreneur.  She helped to form an insurance company which I'm told still exists, Union Protective Life Insurance Company out of Memphis [Tennessee].  Of course, she was voted off the board.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I was too young to remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, the Union Protective Life Insurance Company.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, still exists.
Speaker 1: Okay, still in Memphis [Tennessee].   Well, that's something.  Now, was your grandmother educated?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was.  She was, high school, but that was educated in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So did you know your grandfather at all?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, he was a carpenter.  His name was Benjamin Brooks.
Speaker 1: All right.  And your grandmother's name?  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Lula Brooks.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So your grandfather, was he your mother's stepfather?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's stepfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, because her last name being Green, I wondered.  Did you mother have any stories about growing up, about what it was like down there in Stanton at the turn of the century when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: No, as far as I know, for the most part she grew up, though she was born in Stanton, she grew up in Jackson, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, my grandmother also had a boarding house where she allowed Pullman porters to stay when they came through the city.  Jackson was a kind of a railroad hub.  The IC [Illinois Central] railroad and the GM&O [Gulf, Mobile, and Ohio] railroads came through there.  And when the Pullman porters would get off their run, they'd stay at my grandmother's house.  As I remember it was a great, big house, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, there must be some stories associated with that house, with Pullman porters coming in and out?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I remember them because they used to come in and give me nickels all the time, and that was a lot of money then cause you usually, all the other kids got pennies.  (Laughter) I got nickels from them, yep.  There were, let's see, four that I remember very well.  Even though I was only about six years old. I remember them very well because they used to come in and sing songs to me and helped teach me to sing songs.  And--
Speaker 1: What kind of songs were they teaching you?
Speaker 2: Just little parody type things, you know, that kids learn, like 'Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush' and all that sort of thing.  It was quite interesting back then and it's still interesting because I can remember them now.  And I remember some other things (laughter), kind of derogatory at that time, I guess, but my grandfather used to make home brew which is a kind of a liquid drink.  It was a drink, intoxicating drink.  And this was during Prohibition [1920 to 1933].  He used to set his brew under the stair casing and periodically, you'd hear 'em going "pow".  They'd pop off cause they were fermenting too much (laughter), and have the house smelling like the home brew.  But I remember grandma raising Cain about that, yeah.  It's quite an experience, and I was an only child so I got to see a lot of things around there that other people probably wouldn't have seen.
Story_ID: 29700
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother [Lucile Alma Collier] get a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's a high school graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the name of the black high school there in Jackson [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Merry High School.
Speaker 1: Merry?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, M-E-R-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Oh, M-E-R-R-Y.  Now, who was it named after, do you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was named for a Professor Merry who was a teacher, and it was named for him.  His daughter became principal of that school when he passed away.
Speaker 1: Merry High School, okay.  Now, what did your mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: Mother was a housewife, and she tried to work once.  She slipped off (laughter), tried to work once, one week in a house for a rich lawyer.  And Dad [James Alexander Collier, Sr.] found out she was working out like that, and he made her come home cause he didn't want his wife to work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Yes, there is.  He was a rural boy.  He grew up, poorly educated because Grandfather Collier didn't really want the boys to have a great education.  But he got to go to school when the crops were finished, in what they call "labor time" (unclear), something like that.  But, so he didn't get a great education, maybe fourth grade or more.  And mother was the kind of a person who would reach out to people, and she reached out to him when she met him at a church function and invited him to come over.  And he had dinner with 'em, and he, of course, became her friend, and they decided to marry.
Story_ID: 29701
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was your father's, can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: James Alexander Collier--
Speaker 1: Just like yours.
Speaker 2: Junior, senior rather.  J-A-M-E-S, A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R, C-O-L-L-I-E-R, S-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Ten, four, ninety-eight. [October 4, 1898].
Speaker 1: All right.  And what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: A hundred and eleven years.  My great, great grandmother was 111 years old when she passed away.  And I can't put those numbers together right off the (laughter) top of my head.
Speaker 1: When did she pass away?
Speaker 2: That was in '36 [1936], I believe, '37 [1937].
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was born in the 1820s.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: She was in the 1820s.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And she was still a slave, when they were still slaves.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was born during slavery.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you know her or ever have conversations with her?
Speaker 2: No, I have pictures of her, but I never knew her, obviously.  They came out of North Carolina into Tennessee in the early 1800s.
Speaker 1: So she was, she was from North Carolina originally?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: North Carolina, and then she moved to Tennessee.  Now, did anybody, did she pass along stories about what slavery was like to the rest of your family?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of, no, not that I know of.  There's only one of the cousins, who is quite well informed about the period after she passed, but I don't know anything about that time when she lived.  All I know is where they lived.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So no stories about slavery or Reconstruction or any of that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you think that people just deliberately didn't tell their children about that sort of thing or do you think that they didn't know themselves or what?
Speaker 2: No, as a matter of fact, there were two people in the family who are, they call them griots, something like that, that knew all about the family.  But they passed away and nothing was written down, so, bingo, that was shoveled over.
Speaker 1: Okay, so no story survives at all about her, you know, having lived that long, she probably certainly had a lot to say.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, what about your grandmother, this is your great grandmother, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, did you know your grandmother [Nannie Collier] on that side?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I knew her, but unfortunately, they lived in the county, in the country, as they called it, and we lived in the city.  And we didn't get a chance, the kids anyway, didn't get a chance to visit with her or my grandfather [(Philrow?) Collier] at that time cause he a preacher who went, I forget what they called them now, but he went from place to place.
Speaker 1: Oh, circuit rider.
Speaker 2: The circuit rider, there, you got it (laughter).  But he was a circuit rider.
Speaker 1: And they called them CC rider.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Country circuit.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So he wasn't a very nice grandfather either.  He was rather gruff.
Speaker 1: What denomination was he?
Speaker 2: He was a Baptist preacher.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: He wasn't too fond of little children (laughter), especially little children.  I remember that very well.  And we liked to go climb up on his knee because he had gray, almost silver gray hair like this reflector here, and we used to love to go sit on his lap and play with his hair.  And, boy, he'd go crazy when you touched (laughter) his head.  So, he wasn't very nice (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, had he been to school?  Now, he was a preacher.  He could probably read and write.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was quite well--well, by my standards anyway, educated at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your father [James Alexander Collier, Sr.] have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: No, he had--
Speaker 1: That's right.  You said he went to fourth grade.
Speaker 2: --about fourth grade.  But there's a story behind that too.  In growing up, my mother [Lucile Alma Collier] secretly taught my father to read and write and do a whole lot of other things in the way of education.  I never knew that.  He used to have me sit, in doing my homework, and sit down right before him and do it and then explain everything to him.  In the meantime, he was learning.  And I went to the service [Armed Forces], came back and finished college.  The first job I had teaching, my father was a teacher in the same building, and across the room.  So it was quite an accomplishment for him.  But he--
Speaker 1: So where did he end up going to school?
Speaker 2: He had gone to night school.  She had trained him, and then he went on to night school, and he got his paperwork together to where he could teach in a trade school.  And he was right across the hall from me in a trade school.
Speaker 1: That's something.  Do you know the name of the school he went to ?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hub City, Hub City Trade School.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?  How--
Speaker 2: Hub City.
Speaker 1: Hub City, okay.
Speaker 2: H-U-B, um-hum, Trade School.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, when you think about your parents' personalities and their talents and their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Both of them, very much, yeah.  They were both very gregarious people.  We had a house full of kids--even though I was the only child, we had a house full of kids all the time.  And my mom played with them, she played games with us.  My dad taught us crafts and arts and things like that cause he was very artistic and very mechanical minded.  So I guess I picked up most of the things from both of them.
Story_ID: 29702
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earlier?
Speaker 1: Earliest?
Speaker 2: Yes, when I was about three years old, four.  I had a little car.  I had a picture of that thing, and I can't find it, a little pedal car.  And I ran it under the house, coming down the hill from behind the house and ran it under the house and wedged it, and I remember (laughter) trying to get out of it because I got down like this to keep my head from hitting the house.  And I couldn't get out of the car (laughter).  And I couldn't rouse anybody to come and get me.  So I stayed under there for about four hours or more, I guess.
Speaker 1: That's quite a memory.
Speaker 2: Yeah, scary memory too.  I will never forget that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you grow up in Jackson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum, Jackson, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there a name for your neighborhood there?
Speaker 2: South Jackson.
Speaker 1: So was it an all-black neighborhood?
Speaker 2: No, no.  The, oddly enough, the mixture was greater then than it is right now.  They, I remember four white neighbors interspersed on the same street that I was on, a very short street.  And right behind us was a very rich white guy who was involved in railroading.  I don't remember his name right now, but I remember that he lived right behind us, and we used to play, the kids would play across the fence.  Yeah that's, '37 [1937], '38 [1938], until I got ready to go to high school, they were still there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Jackson [Tennessee] wasn't rigidly segregated as a town?
Speaker 2: No, not in the term that we use segregation now, in the same context, no.  We had different schools.  We had different everything actually, but there was an understanding between the people there where nobody stepped on anybody's toes, so to speak.
Speaker 1: Okay, were the black facilities, I mean the school facilities different from the white ones?
Speaker 2: They were different, yes.  They were good, but they were different.  For example, the high school, we had no manual arts in our high school, but the whites did.  And actually, I walked by the library for years and couldn't go in it, to sit down and get a book out.
Speaker 1: There was no colored library, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.  Were the movie theaters segregated too, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That sort of thing.
Speaker 2: You could go to the same theater, but we had the balcony section that we had to sit in.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't as bad as some places, but it was--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --worse than a lot of them.  There were some worse, but it wasn't as bad as a lot of places.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  No, kids, after school and after other things that we did with our parents, played together, went swimming, skinny dipping together, all the things that kids do.  We never really had the major problems that way.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I could see the difference in the way we lived and where it was carrying me.  For example, the sights, smell and sound all combined into one essence here.  One of the kids that I grew up with, his name was Wayne, worked at the same automobile dealership as my dad [James Alexander Collier, Sr.] and I.  I worked there during the summer months when I wasn't going to school, to college.  I was called into Mr. Johnson, who was the owner, his office one day, and said, "Jimmie, you're gonna have to start calling Wayne, Mr. Wayne."  And I grew up with Wayne.  And I said, what for?  He said, well, because my customers expect that.  Wayne had been made the sup, not superintendent, but a straw boss, they called them then, the straw boss (laughter).  And so at that point I was supposed to switch and drop all these things that we've run around together and skinny dipping and all that and start calling him "Mr.".  I said, I won't do it.  I was an arrogant little son-of-gun.  I was, indeed.  And I said, "I won't do it."  He said, well, you do it or you don't work no more.  I said, okay.  So I made a point of avoiding having to call him.  I'd always catch his eye or something and let him know I wanted to talk to him.  And he was, I guess, understanding enough to realize what position I had and what he had.  And we worked that out with no problem.  But that's the sound and the sight and the smell of segregation right there, all three of them to me.  It was something I had never really undergone before.  So it was kind of stinging too, but my dad told me, this is the way it is and this is the way it has to be for right now.  You'll outgrow it.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you ever outgrow that, and start calling people Mister so and so, that--
Speaker 2: Not that I mind it, but it's out of respect that I do it, and only out of respect that I do it for the individual.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what grade school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Actually, it was all combined in the Merry High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's also--
Speaker 2: South Jackson Elementary, you could call it, yes.
Story_ID: 29703
Speaker 1: Okay, and so all the grades for the black community were in Merry High School [Jackson, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, how many students were there?
Speaker 2: At that time, around 500, around the time that I was there.
Speaker 1: And did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I always liked going to school, very much.
Speaker 1: Get good grades?
Speaker 2: Good grades all the way, yep.
Speaker 1: Did you have favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Professor Brooks.  I'll never forget my science teacher.  He told us all about manhood and growing up and all that sort of thing, along with the things (chuckle) that we should have been taught there.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he tell you things that your parents [James Alexander Collier, Sr. and Lucile Alma Collier]  probably wouldn't have told you?
Speaker 2: He told us many things that our parents didn't know to tell us, yep.  He was a buddy and a teacher and all of the things that, the guys looked up--he was an icon in his own time.  He, everybody looked up to him because he was an excellent teacher.  He, even the kids in, the slow learners, he reached back and picked them up and even had them come to his home and tutored them.  So we didn't have a lot of teachers like that.  Had one geometry teacher and he was also a minister and you would think he would do more toward trying to help than he did.  But he used to tell us, if you were a slow learner, "Boy, hit the rectangle.  You should be behind a mule somewhere," you know, that sort of thing and rather than helping.  But Brooks was just the exact opposite of him, yeah.  We had some good teachers though.
Speaker 1: Okay, about how many teachers were there in your school?
Speaker 2: Um, gee, it's kind of hard to say, really--
Speaker 1: With 500 students, you'd say maybe--
Speaker 2: More like (unclear) (simultaneous) (fifteen?)--
Speaker 1: Fifteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 1: All right, and do you remember the principal?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, A. J. Payne.  Yeah, I remember him very well.  Andrew Jackson Payne.
Speaker 1: Okay, Andrew Jackson Payne, huh, okay.
Speaker 2: A. J. Payne.  He was afraid of his own shadow.
Speaker 1: Was he (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes.  If you told him that the superintendent of schools was coming down that morning, he'd have the spasms (laughter).  They used (laughter) have this superintendent--oh, that's another, the superintendent of schools, we eventually found out didn't have a high school education, yep.
Speaker 1: And he's a white man, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And he's a superintendent, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --inspecting what's going on in the colored schools?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And didn't even have a high school diploma?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he used to come down periodically, unannounced, more often than not, and bring friends with him.  And then he wanted us to sing cause we always had devotion in the mornings then.  And we had a good group of singers in the school system.  And he would have us sing Negro spirituals for him.  But one morning, we all decided we wanted no more.  And we, the music teacher, and her name was Ms. Meachum--I'll never forget her either, she played her little interlude.  We were supposed to start singing, and not a thing came out.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Story_ID: 29704
Speaker 1: We're rolling again.  You said, so the superintendent, where we left off, he came once.  How old were you when you all refused to sing?
Speaker 2: We were sixteen.  We were just before graduation, cause we graduated at seventeen.  Yeah, it was about sixteen years old, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you all got together and decided you were not gonna sing?
Speaker 2: That's right.  We decided we wouldn't do it.
Speaker 1: Now, what caused you all to, you know, well, you said, you were saying during the break, some of the songs you never liked.  You never liked 'Ole Black Joe' and 'Uncle Ned' and some of these other songs, so these are songs, seems like plantation songs or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and this is, in our time we had, the War [World War II] had just started, '41 [1941], I think.  My uncle had come from down in Georgia where he had had a very bad time while he was in training down there.  And there were other guys like him with stories about how they were treated off the post.  And it just sort of stirred the young guys around there into a different mode altogether.  And we formed what we called, it wasn't a caucus or anything like that, but it was just a, how would I put that, a togetherness, to put it simply, that we wanted to change things because why were people like this going to fight and it's going to stay like it was.  We went to the courthouse, took the sign down.
Speaker 1: What sign?
Speaker 2: There was a sign that said "colored" and "white" on the water fountains.  And there was one there, and there was one right in the middle of the city where you caught the buses.
Speaker 1: Now, I just wanted to go back now.  Now, was there a specific incident where all the fellows heard the stories or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they come back like, they just sit around the guys--nothing else to do in a small town but listen (laughter).
Speaker 1: What, they'd sit around on the porches and the barbershops?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they'd sit around the corner.
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: Right, barbershop.  We had one doctor who had an office there who was very open minded and he told the boys about sex and all these other things.  And we'd go up there and listen to him and other ideas about, civic ideas about going to school and what the benefits were for going to school as opposed to going down drinking beer all day.  But anyway, this, going back to the school that day, this is how it came about because we had been comparing notes.  And we said, we're just not doing, gonna do this anymore.
Speaker 1: Was it a surprise to you all that the soldiers, returning soldiers talked about the army being segregated and some of their treatment, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because we thought that was the place to be really, and everybody wanted to go to the service because the guys looked good in their uniform, and they were stepping up in the world and all that.  Some of the guys had gotten stripes in the (unclear), and they were somebody to look up to.  And in a small town like that, you didn't have that many people who were doing things, literally doing things, the teachers, the doctors, and I think we had two lawyers there that were black that were icons or something for you to look up to.  So it makes a lot of difference.
Speaker 1: So you all decided just to not to sing for the superintendent when he showed up?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, the music started and the intro and he's sitting there waiting and nothing came out?
Speaker 2: No.  And she did it a couple of times, and then she got the message very quickly that we were just not gonna do it.  And I remember him very well, getting up, getting his entourage and stalking out of the building.  Now, Professor Payne, A.J., gave us hell (Columbia?) after that.  He gave us a lecture that I shall never forget, and I guess most of them.  But, cause he was really a fraidy (ph.) cat [afraid].
Speaker 1: That's an incredible story.  And so you went downtown and took the colored sign off the fountain?
Speaker 2: Yep, that wasn't all.  We did, the army had, the air force, actually, had a training camp out there in McClellan (ph.) Field, outside the city.  And they moved them out to some other site and they had left the barracks there.  We asked for the barracks because some of the, the white school was getting some of the barracks to house the soldiers and their wives, you know, who were on the other post there.  So in the process, we went up and asked for some of the barracks too.  And it was left to the mayor whether or not you could have them.  And he said, "No, you can't have them."  So we sat down on his steps, and this was way before you had "sit-down" things.  We sat down on his steps for three weeks.  And he came out and said, "Okay, you guys, I'm tired of looking at you."  Get some way to get them out of here, and get those barracks off that post.  And we'll get them.  And we got a group together and tore 'em down and they are to this day, sitting on the college campus at Lane [College, Jackson, Tennessee].  Yeah, but they have brick veneered them since then.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.  Now, you all were really--
Speaker 2: We were together.
Speaker 1: Now, who was your leader?  Did you have a leader?
Speaker 2: We had a guy, an older guy, Hector, I don't remember Hector's last name now.  But Hector was a World War I veteran.  He was a much older guy than we were.  But he was the organizer and the butt kicker in the group.
Speaker 1: That's something.  These are the kinds of stories you don't hear about that much about what the civilians did.
Speaker 2: I know.  We did a lot of things, man, a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Now, this was in the '40s, [1940], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is 1941 or two [1942]?
Speaker 2: Forty-one [1941], '42 [1942], '43 [1943].  We came back from the service and we did it again, '44 [1944], '45 [1945], up to '46 [1946].
Story_ID: 29705
Speaker 1: So, now, did you join the army after school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went in '43 [1943].
Speaker 1: Were you drafted?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're in.  Now, well, when you were on the verge of graduation from high school, did you, now did you graduate with honors or anything or did you--?
Speaker 2: No, I graduated one point or two points, something like that, from Salutatorian.  But we got in a little trouble with the school's administration about some of the things we did, and that kind of knocked us down.  Yeah, but that's another story too.  The white kids at that particular point were graduating wearing, always wearing caps and gowns.  All domestic science classes made us buy suits and the girls make their own dresses, which we found out later there was a collusion between the kids, the department store which sold the yard goods and the domestic arts teacher.  So, (chuckle), she'd be getting a kickback on the material, the amount of material sold.  So they made the girls buy their dresses, make their own dresses.  We decided that year when we graduated we would wear overalls, you know, the blue overalls, the bib overalls and the girls would wear whatever they decided.  And they decided they'd go ahead and make their dresses, but we wore bib overalls.  And the next year, the kids got the caps and gowns.  So we never got them.  They wouldn't give 'em to us, but the next year, they got them.  So, we were just a bunch of little belligerent kids, didn't bother anybody, but we got things done.
Speaker 1: That's a great story.  Now, I know that you have, like music is a big part of your life.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: When did you start playing an instrument?
Speaker 2: At nine, when my father [James Alexander Collier] got me a violin.  He always wanted me to do something different.  I, bless his heart (chuckle).  But he bought me a violin and gave me a violin teacher.  And lessons cost twenty-five cents a pop or a meal, whichever was, they happened to have at the time.  And now, cause I went from violin to the trombone and then, I went in the service and tried out for army band and made it.  And I learned the rest of the instruments in the service.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you made the army band in the service?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: That's a good thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you're also an artist and you write some poetry.  Were you writing poetry in school or doing any art?
Speaker 2: I was doing art, but I didn't write poetry until a few years ago actually.  And I was impressed by what Maya Angelou was doing and actually, I got an opportunity to do a trilogy with Maya and, I'm trying to say her name, from Nashville [Tennessee], the poet?
Speaker 1: Oh, Nikki Giovanni?
Speaker 2: Nikki Giovanni.  A guy out of Chicago [Illinois] was gonna do this for us, and he passed away before we could put it together.  So it stayed on the table for about twenty years, and I just, recently, my daughter says, "Dad, you gotta publish this stuff."  And I--
Speaker 1: A man in Chicago was gonna publish it?  Was it Chicago or Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, it was Chicago.  I'll think of his name in a minute.
Speaker 1: Dudley Randall came to mind in Detroit.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't--
Speaker 1: Hoyt Fuller?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Was it Hoyt Fuller?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was the editor of 'Black World' or?
Speaker 2: I can't think of his name.  I'll get it, but he was gonna do this trilogy for us.  And Maya [Angelou] went on and, of course, Nikki [Giovanni] went on, and I stayed on the table.  But I never met either of them actually, but he was doing this.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about artwork?  Did you always like to draw?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yes.  I had a teacher who used to spank my hands because I'd get through with my homework or work at the desk, and I'd just draw.  And they'd come by and see you drawing and slap your hand.  That discouraged me a lot too, and when I got into college, I had to take an art class.  And I turned in a project once, it was a plate.  And painted around the edges of it, put some flowers and the art instructor told me, you'll never be an artist.  And that wasn't my intention.  And so I let that lay for a long time, and then one day I passed an art shop downtown and saw some discounted art supplies.  And I went in and bought some and it just took off.  And that's what I really enjoy doing.  It's an outlet for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it didn't have much, it didn't happen until much later, after you were grown.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, yeah.
Story_ID: 29706
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, when you were a senior in high school, did you pretty much know that you were gonna be drafted and go off to the service?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what unit were you drafted into?
Speaker 2: I went first into an outfit that decoded, the crypt, it was cryptology.  I placed pretty highly in the exams that they gave us and they put us into this unit.  And we sent radio messages and received them and all that sort of thing.  And we stayed in there for, during the whole time, that was during the training period.
Speaker 1: Now, where were you at--?
Speaker 2: Fort Benning, Georgia, North Carolina, Fort Bragg, North Carolina and Petersburg, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where I came out.  I was discharged from Petersburg, but they sent me out there to a music school to learn directing and so forth.  So, and I was discharged from there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were in the army band too, you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.  Yeah, we went all over the South, selling war bonds and playing.  We'd play a dance, and the admission to the dance was a war bond, and tobacco warehouses, all of them down in North Carolina and on down in Louisiana and so forth.  It was nice.  We had a bus, and we had a twenty-five voice choir that were from a WAC [Women's Army Corps] detachment that also traveled with us.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you go overseas at all?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't go overseas.  They never saw fit to send us.
Speaker 1: So do you remember the name of your unit?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, 340th Service, Army Service Force Band.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Three fortieth [340th].
Speaker 1: Now, what happened when you were discharged?
Speaker 2: I was discharged from Camp Chevy, Arkansas.  We were shipped in there before Christmas and we were supposed to come out by Christmas day.  The post commander hadn't had a band in years on his post and he decided he'd keep us there.  And we stayed there until March.  In fact, we had to write, well, somebody wrote the Addison General's department to get us out of there.  And he wouldn't let us go.
Speaker 1: Now, did you find the army to be as bad in terms of the racial discrimination as people had described it to you and the other fellows?
Speaker 2: No, as a matter of fact, I had a good time in the service, a really good time.  I married early and I had quarters for my wife and my first-born child, and when I was on the post, I'd go to work in the morning, come home in the evening, go to work in the morning, come home in the evening, just like anybody else.  And we had fellows who were really, really a unit in every way.  So we didn't have any problems that way.  And when we were on the road traveling, it was nice.  We got extra compensation for time that we were away from the post, and it was just pretty nice.  We played a lot of dances for the Officers Club, and we got paid extra for that.  So I saved a little money, took care of my little family.  When it was all told, no discrimination at all.  We lived in different units, so there was no, no reason for, you know, any contact as such.
Story_ID: 29707
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us about how you met your wife?
Speaker 2: My first wife?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've been married twice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter), this is, oh, Lord.  She'll kill me, but she told, being the gentleman I tried to be, she told everybody on campus--we wasn't in college together, she told everybody on campus--
Speaker 1: Now, this is before you went into the army?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You met her before.  Okay, I didn't know you were in college before you went to the army.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: I thought you went right after high school.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I went--
Speaker 1: So you went to first--?
Speaker 2: I went to Lane [College, Jackson, Tennessee], yeah, I went--
Speaker 1: Okay, you went to Lane for a year and then went to the army?
Speaker 2: Not a full year even.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway, I met her, and we went to the show, to the movies a couple of times.  So when I went into service, she told everybody that we were gonna get married when I came out of service.  I came home on a furlough, and her daddy had her things packed and ready to go.  Yep, and then the little gentleman that I thought I was (laughter), I went along with it.  And we got married, with my mother's permission cause she had to sign for me.  And that's the way I met her.  Yep.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you feel?  Did you feel railroaded?
Speaker 2: I felt railroaded, scared, railroaded.  I wanted to jump out of the car on the way to the wedding ceremony with the JP, the Justice of the Peace ceremony.  We made it for twelve years and then I just couldn't take anymore.  I just couldn't do it.
Speaker 1: So you really didn't have a chance to get to know her very well?
Speaker 2: Twelve years, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, twelve years, but before you married her?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: So you had no idea, you didn't know if you were compatible or not when you got married, I guess?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: As it turned out, it was not.
Speaker 2: But we're good friends now, (chuckle) and so (unclear).
Story_ID: 29708
Speaker 1: Okay, so, all right, so when you came out of the service, did you come back to Jackson [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, came back to Jackson.
Speaker 1: This is nineteen forty, what?  Five [1945]?
Speaker 2: '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: '46 [1946], okay.
Speaker 2: Went back to school to '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: So you went back to Lane [College, Jackson, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, Lane's a CME school.
Speaker 2: It's a CME school, yes.
Speaker 1: Christian Methodist Episcopal now.  Then it was Colored Methodist Episcopal.
Speaker 2: It was Colored Methodist then.
Speaker 1: What was it like?  What was Lane like?
Speaker 2: Lane was a small school, but a very good school.  You had a lot of attention from student to instructor.  There was not a lot of people and the classrooms were never overcrowded and you had some genuine people with a Christian attitude doing the teaching at that time.  So we learned a lot, and they, especially when it came to the sciences, they really dwell hard on that.  And we had a lot of guys coming in from service that were, wanted to be football players and athletes of different natures, but they didn't let them drag their feet.  You still had to study and I appreciated that.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a, what was your major?
Speaker 2: Major was social science.
Speaker 1: Okay, social science?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, what, was your goal to become a teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, who were some of the teachers that influenced you at Lane [College, Jackson, Tennessee]?  Did you have favorite teachers or did anyone emerge as a mentor to you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had Professor Beck.  He was a chemistry teacher.  And I guess Dean Shy.  He was a history teacher.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: S-H-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, just like a "shy" person.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Peter Rabbit Shy (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Peter Rabbit Shy?
Speaker 2: That's what we used to call him.
Speaker 1: His name was P. R. Shy.  And we called him Peter Rabbit Shy.  And I think, I see his face right now, but I can't think of his, he was a physics teacher.  I liked him very much, and he was a good instructor too.  Wow, his name was right on the tip of my tongue.
Speaker 2: Well, that's okay.  If you think of it, we'll get back to it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll think of it later probably.
Speaker 2: So, your goal was to become a teacher, and you took, now, when you were in school--
Speaker 1: Liberal arts.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I took the liberal arts and dwelled on the chemistry and the math, but you still need that.  And I wanted to follow my friends.  I had two or three friends that were going for mathematical degrees.  And they wanted to get pre-med and all the subjects that went with it.  But I was trying to play music at the same time.  And I, just a little (unclear) to better to do that.  But I enjoyed what I was doing, and I was still playing my music.  Back in '46 [1946], '47 [1947], I was making ten thousand dollars a year playing music.  And that was a lot of money back then, a lot of money.
Story_ID: 29709
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of the group you were playing with?
Speaker 2: Jim Collier and the Rhythmaires.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we played all the little towns around there and be back home every night.
Speaker 1: That's something.  Jim Collier and Rhythmaires.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, how many people were in your group?
Speaker 2: Five people.
Speaker 1: Five?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Were they like a trombone or saxophone?
Speaker 2: Let's see, you had trombone, saxophone, and I had the rhythm section, a guitar, a drummer and a base man, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you, so you toured basically around here, around St. Louis [Missouri], Kansas City?
Speaker 2: Around Jackson, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Oh, around Jackson, okay, Jackson, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So you had Humboldt [Tennessee], Dyersburg [Tennessee], Trenton [Tennessee],(unclear) all those little town around thirty mile, forty mile radius and people loved to dance back then.  So we'd make this little town, and make that big money.  And like I said, that was big money back then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the style of music was big band music, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Band music, so.  I imagine, yeah, a little town that wanted to have a dance, a live band is better than anything else [ringing phone]. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on a second.  We have spend.
Speaker 2: Was there any particular tune you like to play the most or was your favorite, the favorite tune or a fan favorite?
Speaker 1: Yes, there is.  I guess maybe all musicians at one time or other liked 'How High the Moon' because of the difficulty in the chords they were playing.  That's the way we used to test the guys to see whether they could play, and we'd play it at one low, slow tempo and then move the tempo up gradually to where he could rattling his fingers up (unclear).
Speaker 2: How does that go, 'How High the Moon'
Speaker 1: Dah, dah [humming melody], I've had a stroke, so the vocal chords are gone.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I get the idea.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's a finger buster if you, especially the bridge of it.  If you don't know the chords, you can't play it.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 29710
Speaker 1: Okay, so your band, you're doing well with the band, making ten thousand dollars a year with a band in 1940--
Speaker 2: Forty-six [1946].
Speaker 1: Forty-six [1946], that's real good.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: College graduates coming out of school in 1964 were making about four thousand dollars a year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know cause I was one of them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was my brother's salary when he came out of Central State as an accountant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I taught school twenty-eight hundred dollars a year, twenty-eight hundred.
Speaker 1: You were making five, you know--
Speaker 2: Almost five.
Speaker 1: Almost five times as much.
Speaker 2: Yep, um-hum.  It's four times.
Speaker 1: Four times as much, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we enjoyed it.  When I came here [St. Louis, Missouri], I think the first teaching thing I did was around twenty-four hundred [dollars], I think.  And I was offered, I was actually offered a job teaching in my hometown before I came here for forty dollars a week.  They wanted to pay you by the week, a forty dollar school week.  And I said, no.
Speaker 1: What could you hope to make if you stayed around a long time?  Twice that?
Speaker 2: Something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, the average factory worker in a General Motors plant was making seventy dollars a week (unclear).  So you just think about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was an offer from the Jeans supervisor who was in charge of all the schools there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jeans supervisor, yeah, James T. Jeans Fund?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: They would fund schools in the rural South.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And she was supervisor.  No thank you.  I'm gone.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about moving to St. Louis [Missouri].  How did you decide to move here instead of someplace else?
Speaker 2: Well, I came here for, actually for a baseball game with my cousin who was already living here.  And he showed me around, and I liked the city.  And I saw potential that I didn't have there, and I told him I'd come back.  So I came back and stayed a week and found a job, went to the Board of Education, and they gave me a temporary assignment, you know, working as substitute teacher.  And that's the way I got into St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what year is this?
Speaker 2: 1950.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell me why, I guess I still didn't ask you why did you want to get out of music, I mean or not play as much music, I mean and to teach rather than--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I didn't get out of music.  As a matter of fact, I got more into it because here I met a bunch of professional musicians who could bring me up to a point in life, I mean musical life, that is, that I could never have reached down there with their association because you could go here--there were literally dozens of places that you could go and sit in with seasoned musicians and learn your trade.  And that's the only way, believe me, to learn your trade is to play with guys better than you are.  And I got that opportunity.  So I worked the school system in the daytime, and I worked music at night.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have children at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure did.
Speaker 1: How many?
Speaker 2: I had five, over the period of time, you know, over the years.
Speaker 1: Okay, at that time you didn't have five, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, just two.
Speaker 1: Two, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it worked out and like I said, I played one end of the city to the other.  I played with pit bands.  We were some of the first black musicians to play in the pit band downtown and simply because we could read well and a lot of them couldn't.  But the overall picture for me was to learn my trade so, the music trade, that is, not just playing but how to book, produce, how to write the music that the people wanted and all of those things that went with it.
Story_ID: 29711
Speaker 1: Now, who was on the music scene when you got here?  Who were some of the top musicians here that, you know, influenced you?
Speaker 2: Well, we had Archie Burnside, Shirley Ann, let's see, Eddie Randall.  He just recently passed.  He was a riverboat player.  Let's see, Onzie Horne, see his (face?) (unclear) oh, Chuck Berry too, yeah, worked with Chuck. (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 1: And Pappy Keyes, these are all, Ernie Wilkins who eventually worked with Basie [Count Basie] and Jimmy Forest, who was Night Train Forest, yeah, he was in groups too.  All of those guys were in the groups from time to time, a lot of people that we outgrew.  Some got left behind, some went on to bigger bands and better bands.
Speaker 2: And so you're teaching and, what are you teaching in school actually?
Speaker 1: Actually, I was teaching music, that's band music and the seventh and eighth grades.  And as a sub teacher, you go into high schools.  I've had the chemistry classes cause I had qualified, I had enough hours in all those courses to teach.  In those courses, even though I didn't have a master's at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay, now did you teach full time eventually?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hum, yeah, about four years.  And then I came out of that full-time situation into private industry with Monsanto.  The money was big enough, long enough (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, it was a domestic crisis that triggered you were telling me when I came in.  What happened?  Tell us what happened?
Speaker 1: About the wife?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she became unfaithful actually and had started playing little games and stuff.  And I took it as long as I could.  I told my mom [Lucile Alma Collier], I said, mom, I'm gonna stay here until you die.  If that's forever, then I'll be there forever, but the moment you're gone, I'm gone (chuckle).  And I did.  And she died in '54 [1954] and I left in '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Okay, so you had an ex-wife and there was something about the amount of money that she needed with, for you to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and she was constantly on me about I'll need more money, I need more money.  And I need more money.  So I had to go somewhere else to get that extra money.  And I couldn't do it.  I just couldn't survive myself and pay her what she was asking and what the courts had set for her cause I gave her the house and everything in it and just went off for myself.  But I didn't like living that way cause I had been accustomed to living far above that.  So I picked up a newspaper one morning and saw this add that Monsanto had in the paper, looking.  Well, actually, it wasn't Monsanto.  It was a temporary agency who was procuring people for Monsanto to work on this project.  And it said, some (unclear)[silicon?] just coming off the ground, the developmental stage, and they wanted to put me in research and development because of my background and because of the things that I did on the test, where I placed on a test that they gave us.  And I passed it, and the rest is history.
Speaker 2: Now, this is, I know I was surprised that you do so many things and now you're going from music to just hard science here, you're in.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, exactly.
Story_ID: 29712
Speaker 1: Okay, so what happened at Monsanto and what was this silicon project they were working on?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, we were pulling crystal, and there's only about .75 in diameter, a little bitty piece, about like that.  And we'd pull those from the crucibles.  We made p-chips up, that's what we called them at the time, before you slice 'em up.  You slice them on the band saw and multiple slices.  We sliced them up and then put them on the reactor and doped them with arsenic or boron and that would make it positive or a negative chip, the type of chemical that you used to dope it with.  And this way, we could get a positive or connection with it.  And then further on down the line we got so that we could polish it.  We learned to lap it and to polish it, and the developmental stages were slow, dangerous because you're using a lot of trichlorosilane is dangerous any way you look at.  It could blow this place or blow the block up and the plants where we were.  You had, you had, we didn't know at the time that we should use gloves to keep our hands from picking up the tetrachloride, dry tetrachloride, cause it can get into your blood stream and start giving you problems.  But we eventually picked those things up by, just by learning.  And we didn't have anybody who really knew anything.  Everybody was trying to learn at the same time.
Speaker 1: So you were in a field that wasn't, really hadn't been explored before?
Speaker 2: That's it, it was totally new as far as we were concerned.  There had been treatises written by different people, but nobody had really done anything with it to make it work.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now what form would the silicon come to you in, as raw material?
Speaker 2: It came to us as sand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then was heated to extremely high temperatures, but I didn't do that myself.  There were other guys who did that in the furnaces and added trichlorosilane to doping and so forth, and they came out with a different drug.  I think I have some of that here, some of that raw product that we used to start with.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was the ultimate goal of the project, to create what?
Speaker 2: You know, at that particular time, we didn't have nothing (unclear) except to pull a good crystal (laughter) and one that would actually function because you could get so many defects in the crystal that even though you got the crystal, you couldn't do anything with it.  You couldn't build a circuit on it because of the orientation.  And the orientations went all haywire, like one, one, one [111] or one double 0 [100], or just fall out all together where it would be zero.  So we had to learn to control all those things, the rate of pull and the rate of heat and all of those things were variables that we didn't understand so we had to just work at it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long did the project last before you came up with a product that people could use?
Speaker 2: About two years, roughly, and they went into building a plant, a production plant, from the pilot plant.
Speaker 1: So what, this is in '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: No, '63 [1963], '64 [1964].  They actually built the plant in '65 [1965], built in St. Peters, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when did you start working for Monsanto?  Was it fifty--
Speaker 2: '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: No, it wouldn't be '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, you said '54 [1954] before.
Speaker 2: No, '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: You started working for Monsanto--
Speaker 2: No, I left, divorced my wife in '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you started working for Monsanto in '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.  All right.  So, they built the pilot plant in '64 [1964], '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: In '64 [1964], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 29713
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, guide us through the rest of this, now.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: I said, guide us through the rest of this story because I don't know where to go next.  And tell me what the coup de grace in this story.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: I know eventually, what you do, but just guide us through the process.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we went to, after setting up the plant, we had some guys come in and they didn't know anything about the silicon process, but we trained them to be our supervisors (chuckle), and it, so a kind of a downhill thing for the first two, three months because when they realized how dangerous the process was, they didn't do very well as supervisors.  And it's my opinion, and if you are gonna be a leader, you gotta know what you, where you're going and at least be able to tell somebody what's happening.  But they could never tell us anything, so we had very little respect for those people.  And we were doing the work, and they were getting the credit for it.
Speaker 1: Because they were the supervisors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  And they were always over your shoulder trying to pick up on what you're doing and then writing reports.  We called them "we" reports.  "We" did this and "we" did that, you know, and so forth and so on.  And I've got a lot of material back over there on that table that would reflect that and pictures and all that sort of thing.  For example, we had to have some way of determining what the electrical quality of the slice was.  After we had developed, a friend of mine and I had developed a method of doing that, they sent a guy over to show us how to do it (chuckle).  And we found out this guy had been looking at our journals and copying stuff out of there, so we set him up.  And (chuckle) put some erroneous material in there, and he went to the reading that morning and read out what he had done, and yada, yada, yada, yada, and everybody started turning around looking at him strangely.  And he knew something was wrong, but he didn't know what.  And when it finally hit him, he said, "Why would you do that?"  Why would you do that?" and turned looking at us.  We fixed him.  And we did a lot of things.  We had to protect ourselves though.  The reception that you got from the hierarchy and there was one, I mean it was tight too, of group leaders who was get away from here, I don't want you here in the first place.  You don't have any business here.  But because we were the nucleus of the process, they couldn't get rid of us.  They tried to, shifted us here and shifted us there, put us in different departments.  That's how I happened, as one person, happened to get into so many different areas of the plant because you get in there and do well and you started shining a little bit, you get sent somewhere else.  And I always managed to keep a good log so that I could prove what I was doing was right, and if anybody wanted to research it, here, take a look at it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, were you following the Civil Rights Movement in the rest of the country during this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did a lot of speaking to that effect, moving here and there with different groups and (unclear) of the bank down in the city so we'd get some tellers in there.  And I was the president of Operation Family for about four years, which was a group founded by the, sponsored by the Danforth Foundation where we placed a black family and a white family together so that they could learn from each other what things they liked to do, what things were necessary for them to do to survive as a family.  And actually, though it's been many years ago, I still hear from the family that I had.  They're out in North Carolina now, but I still hear from them.
Speaker 1: Okay, what did you learn that surprised you?
Speaker 2: What did I learn that surprised me?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what did they learn that surprised them?  Did anything stick out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that people, (chuckle) not really any difference in people.  We all have the same needs, the same love, same hatreds.  It's not to do with race really.  It's mental attitude.
Speaker 1: Now, had you remarried by that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you and your second wife have any children?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had five.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Five more?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Big daddy (laughter).  And one is, I've got, I have a nurse, engineer, let's see, Willie's a, works for General Motors and he's pretty high up there, and I have one that works for (unclear) she's eleven or twelve.  She's twelve now and another nurse, and did well.  They're good kids, no trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, we're what in 19-- I think it was the late '60s [1960s] you really started to be able to--
Speaker 2: The movement.
Speaker 1: --to be able to create those small circuits, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, we did it before then, but it wasn't on a mass level.  Internally, we were making our own circuits for a while.  And then said, well, why would we do this because we're competing against our customers.  So we stopped making the circuits and just made the raw silicon.  Groups like Texas Instrument, HP, Hewlett Packard, let's see, there's another one out of, Phillips of England, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, they're a group over there.  So we just supplied them with silicon, plus, the numerous college groups that had scientific areas dealing in that and the development of silicon.
Story_ID: 29714
Speaker 1: I grew up, you know, in the '60s [1960s] and saw devices get smaller and smaller, you know, remember how pick the pocket calculator was in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --1962, '63 [1963] when they emerged and then saw them, you know, they were like two hundred dollars when they first came out (laughter).  What was the first device that the silicon chip was used in?
Speaker 2: Well, we used them for kids' toys actually, little sun-driven toys.  We made solar cells, put 'em in the little fans and little clocks and things like that.  And originally, that was just a way of seeing what you could do with them.  And then, of course, it went from the circuits and became more and more complex, where you started doing calculations with the product.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, your major contribution was in developing a patent, a device to slice the silicon to certain thinness, right?
Speaker 2: Well, that too, how to calculate the electrical characteristics of the slice, and then I ran one of the major, the first computers that they made that was able to do that.  A guy named Jim Houston and myself worked together on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Numerous other things on the plant floor I did, such as methods of adjusting the tension on the blade without taking the blade down.  That was a time saver.  We have made quite a bit of money because you didn't have to take the machine all the way down in order to adjust the tension on a blade, just put it through a hole and adjust, turn the screws around--really simple.  I don't know why nobody else had thought of it before.  But you had to drill one hole there, and you'd turn that hole from screw to screw, put the pneumatic gun through there, tighten the screw and about your business.  But there were a lot of things like that that we did.
Speaker 1: What's your major accomplishment, I guess?  What do you consider to be your major accomplishment in terms of your work with Monsanto?
Speaker 2: I would say the one where we did the slicing because the way the blade was made, we had developed a blade that was, as it cut, it also lapped which eliminated a whole process, a whole another process as you cut.  See, when you go through slicing, it's an I.D. blade, imagine, with a hole opening like this and then a rod that goes inside this way.  That blade comes down and slices through the rod.  It leaves damage from the diamond edge of the blade and especially if it's out of true.  So in order to eliminate that, we made sure that it was actually true and we made a single-plated blade with no edge, nothing but an edge and no sides on it.  It sounds simple, but it's very, very, a difficult thing to do.  And this saves what we call "kerf" , that loss that you have from side to side as the blade goes through, like sawdust, same thing.  But it eliminated most of that and when you eliminate that, you eliminate the loss of silicon which raises your output and also raises your money cause you haven't lost any material.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that the, so when you made your contribution, you had to, you patented the device, but you were telling me off, you know, when I came, that Monsanto had the rights to use it exclusively for seventeen years or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, unfortunately, anything that we did, they were assigned a patent if you had a patent on it, they were assigned that patent for seventeen years.  And after that, of course, you got residuals from it, from any use of it.  And that can be rather large in this industry.  And anyone who may use it in the industry, or outside the industry for that matter, or find a use for it, unless they come up with an improvement on it.  And so far, no--they haven't had any improvement patents on mine.
Story_ID: 29715
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you.  Now, what do they do with these thinly-sliced chips of silicon?  How do they make a circuit on that?
Speaker 2: Well, basically, to put it simply, in other words, it's a lot more complex than I'm gonna put it.  You slice the material, then usually you lap it which is a (finer?)-- to get rid of the salt marks and any other damage that you might have on the surface.  And then you polish it which takes it even another step to smooth it out.  Then you put an application of epitaxial material on it that will determine what kind of slice.  It will be a plus or a minus slice, plus or minus being positive or negative.  Then, of course, you put another layer on there which is something like you'd film on a piece of film, that layer.  You expose it to the light with whatever circuitry that you want on that.  The circuitry, of course, has been reduced so it will fit.  You project that onto the negative thing, the negative--
Speaker 1: Layer of, yeah.
Speaker 2: --layer, and then you take it out.  Of course, you dip it into something that, there are several ways of doing it.  Dip it so that you use something to remove it, and there are several, like I said, things that are proprietary.  They didn't like you to talk about the way they remove it.  And then, of course, you have exposed area after that, and that is exposed as your circuit.  It may have another layer put on it and another and another, which is a subterfuge layer, each one having its own purpose, gates in between them.  And, of course, we stopped doing the circuitry because as I said, we were competing with our customers.  And then we were giving away information as well when we're doing that cause many of the people were still going along, sort of without rhyme or reason, picking up other people's circuitry and adapting it to their purpose.  So they stopped putting it on there all together, and everybody's got their own proprietary secrets.  And Bill Gates is one of the primary people for that.  You know, he's really, really, really tight.
Speaker 1: Okay, Bill Gates and Microsoft, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's basically a photo process on the chip, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.  That's what it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so that means then that we would not have these silicon chips, these Intel chips and that sort of thing in computers if you had not invented this process to slice the silicon to a certain thinness, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, thinness.  It's not only the thinness, but it's the orientation cause certain orientation, if the orientation isn't right, you can't put the layer that you want on there and have it work anyway.  All of that initial process will determine how long your product actually lasts and how well the product actually performs.  If you have that surface damage on there, all kinds of crazy things start to happen after a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So if your computer has a bad one, it'll crash (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That's possible, yeah, very possible.  And the way they apply the epitaxial layer, the whole bit, how it was diced cause you know you can put on a slice this large, four-inch.  I cut the very first one that was ever cut, four-inch diameter.  You can put thousands of circuits on it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so, now how long did you work for Monsanto?
Speaker 2: Twenty-two years, actually, two years for this company and then twenty years for Monsanto actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, and so you retired in what year?
Speaker 2: '85 [1985].
Story_ID: 29716
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do in '85 [1985]?  You have a lot of other interests so did you devote yourself to music or television production?
Speaker 2: No, not exactly.  I left there, I went out as a manager for Silicon Technology Corporation, a world-wide manager for quality.
Speaker 1: So what was your official title?  You were a world-wide?
Speaker 2: Manager for Quality Assurance.
Speaker 1: And that's for Monsanto?
Speaker 2: No, it's Silicon Technology Corporation.
Speaker 1: Silicon Technology Corporation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (Oak?) [sic, Oakland], New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay, Pope, New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Oakland.
Speaker 1: Oakland, okay.  All right, any other stories about them before we leave, I mean leave that part?
Speaker 2: One, I can't tell.  It wouldn't be good for the camera anyway (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, something useful, I guess for anybody, you know, wanting to get involved in this in the future, and what should they watch out for?  What should they be-- How can they protect themselves as an inventor or someone who has an idea in a big corporation, a black person, who at the time that you were doing this, black folks were fighting for civil rights.  You know, and here you are in a corporation where white people are vulnerable, you know, often to the powerful such as, you know, a Philo T. Farnsworth invited the television and never got his due and others that, you know, that can tell some of the stories.  But what could you tell somebody who--?
Speaker 2: Well, the only thing I would say here is if you have any ideas, make sure that they're thoroughly documented, that they're witnessed by someone other than yourself and make two or three copies of them or more, and put them in places where you can easily get to them.  Don't divulge anything that you would not have anybody to know.  It's that simple, because if you can develop it without the aid of the company that you're working for, do so because otherwise, it's gonna be most likely assigned to that company.  You miss a lot of big money because you don't, if you don't do that.
Speaker 1: And you may not even get credit for it--
Speaker 2: You may not and most of the time, you will not.  Unfortunately, I've been to that scene too, yep.  Either that or have somebody get their name on that just walked into your project two days before you get started with running your disclosure.  And they walk in and he automatically gets included in there.  So it's not a good practice to be lax about that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 29717
Speaker 1: Now what did you do immediately after retirement?
Speaker 2: I came home after two years with the Silicon Technology Corporation and cause I thought I'd been out there long enough and away from home long enough cause I traveled an extreme amount of the time and spend more time with the wife.  And that I did.  And I worked, excuse me, with church groups, (with the band?), bunch of kids that had been teaching music too.  We produced shows like I was telling you about Art Blakey.  We had Wynton Marsalis --
Speaker 1: Would you produce these shows for a specific venue, you know, or where were they performing and did you have a company that you had started yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a friend of mine had a club down in the city [St. Louis, Missouri], Otis Hightower to be exact, the LaCosta Club.  And he had the space, and I had the money and the know-how and so we went together and just produced shows down there, small jazz groups, had a lot of fun and made a few bucks.
Speaker 1: You said you had Art Blakey in there once, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum, yeah.
Speaker 1: Art Blakey and who else?
Speaker 2: We had, oh, what's his name, Jimmy Smith, the other organist guy?
Speaker 1: Jack McDuff or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had Jack McDuff, we had him once, and we had--
Speaker 1: Another organ guy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Bill Doggett, I'm trying to think of all the ones I know.
Speaker 2: We had, I knew Bill, but we--
Speaker 1: Charles Earland?
Speaker 2: Charles Earland, that's the one I'm trying to think of, yeah, Charles Earland.  We had him, and we had Carmen McRae, what's her name?  Etta James, Moms Mabley (chuckle) and a whole bunch of guys from around here and in the general area.  They were good (unclear), but they came in.  So Otis decided he wanted to go, he always did, he was a big gambler, and he wanted to go to Vegas [Las Vegas, NV], and so he moved to Vegas, sold the place and he's still out there.  And he's in poor health now, but he's there.
Story_ID: 29718
Speaker 1: So now you had a, you were telling me about a television show too that you were producing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a show called 'Street Level,' and a spiritual show called 'Nothing But the Spirit.'  'Nothing But the Spirit' was produced at the churches, everyday church services every Sunday and some other things that were done, you know, in the church.  We used two to three cameras on the shoot and (unclear) board, and, of course, editing and all that.  And we'd shoot some of the dignitaries, if you wanna call them that.  They came into the city at the Sheldon Hall and at the Fox Theater.  As a matter of fact, we shot Tyler Perry's first show here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he needed some help at that time.  He was just down on it.  He was living out of his car and everything.  He paid us three hundred dollars to shoot that show, but he wanted it for his, what's the word I want to use here, stand-in's, secondary people, you know.  What's the word I want there?
Speaker 1: The cast that, the cast that wasn't on the stage?
Speaker 2: The cast to look at--
Speaker 1: To look at the shoot, yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, and not have to go to rehearsal all the time.
Speaker 1: The understudies.
Speaker 2: Yeah, understudy, yeah, and so we shot that for him for three hundred bucks.  And he still says, hi, when he comes here.  He's a beautiful person, beautiful person.  But he's a long way from there right now.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: We went to see his movie the other night, his new movie.  It's very good, very well written, very well acted.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in those days he was hitting the, what they called the "chitterling circuit" to all the--
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: --black theaters in towns and--
Speaker 2: Here with a bunch of cliches and the whole bit.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.  So, now, how long did your TV show last?
Speaker 2: Oh, we went on for about eight years actually, won two or three awards for that.
Speaker 1: So you had a mixture of celebrities and the local people involved in different issues and things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum, and then during the Black History Month, we would run the special on that.  We did a lot of research and put together some documentaries on that.
Speaker 1: What were some of the documentaries?
Speaker 2: One was about the disposition of land in North Carolina after the Civil War [1861-1865].  Many, many, many blacks had farms that were given to them and unfortunately, they didn't hang onto them.  They were taken away.  We did research on the, what was happening with the black politician after the Civil War and how many of them moved up into the, into Washington [D.C.] where they eventually, (unclear) fooled right on out of the circuit, who'd been up there, but some way or other got, had sticky hands and were moved out of there.  So we did shows on that, and like I say, we did normal shows on gang, well, gangs around here as opposed to gangs in California and how the gang could be used as a binding factor, as opposed to people killing each other or fighting each other.  But I believe even now that that was one of the best shows that we ever did, was showing that comparison of what those kids coming together could do.  When we had them actually come and sit down like I'm sitting here now and talk about why they were doing this, most of them couldn't tell us.  They were just looking for a sense of belonging to some group or somebody.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the major gang here in St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: The Spiders.
Speaker 1: The Spiders?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Spiders and the Turks, primarily.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you talked about the different gangs, summits they were having in those days to try to curtail some of the gang violence?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hum.  Yeah, they came to a realization way back that what they were doing was just against themselves really, trying to claim their turf, little penny-ante guys out there with a nickels worth of this and a nickels worth of that and some soap that they'd put in a package and all kinds of crazy ways of trying to get over on people, shooting each other up.  All they had to do is somebody take time with them and show them that that wasn't the way to do it.
Story_ID: 29719
Speaker 1: Okay, now you've just published a book of poetry?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: The cover is your own artwork, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Well, you told us earlier how you got interested in poetry, I guess, but it's taken a long time for it develop--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I guess an incubator inside of you and come out.  So what do you write about?
Speaker 2: Well, everyday things, my personal feelings, the things I see other people do (chuckle).  I'm a people watcher and the little idiosyncrasies that people don't even know they've got, I've seen them.  And I like to point 'em out in some tactful sort of way.  I like to watch people in church, and I have one in there that I call "Sunday Christians" and you notice how people will look at some young lady that they know in our congregation.  They know she's not married and she comes in pregnant.  You just watch the looks on their faces.  Or the one, the guy who's sitting up there and everybody knows he's drunk from the night before, and he's still smelling.  And to look at the attitudes, and you have to read that one (chuckle) in order to feel what I feel about it.  But it's, and the, one day I was sitting in church.  I know this guy was a priest at one time, but he's not any longer.  So, he, he's still, but he's still got his collar turned around, you know, so to speak.  So people are looking at him like this, you know, what's he doing with the collar still on, yada, yada, yada.  And another one, married, she had been a nun, and she got married, same look.  But poetry to me is just a way of interpreting what you end up feeling in a nice, palatable sort (laughter) of way for other people.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you're still volunteering for your church, right?  What's the name of your church?
Speaker 2: New North Side Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: All right, and you've done some youth volunteering and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we train people to do video, as much as I know about it, and we went to, had the good fortune to go to a cable station and train at the cable station years ago, over twenty years ago now.  And so I'm just passing on what I know.  And I've had a lot, lots of experience in shooting different things, all kinds of different things in all kinds of different conditions.  So we learned a lot that way, and I'm just passing it on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 29720
Speaker 1: Now, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I would hope that we would be more concerned about where we actually are.  A lot of people don't know even now where we are.  They think, oh, I'm doing fine.  No, you're not.  You're not nearly where you should be or could be.  And that is one thing that we're gonna have to learn, and we're gonna have to prepare ourselves to accept an opportunity when it comes.  We get an opportunity, and we're not ready for it.  Why?  Because we're not putting that time that you've been blessed with in the right place, learning something, doing something.  And that's one thing I, even though he's been dead for many years, I still see my father [James Alexander Collier, Sr.] saying, "Keep on, keep on," and he meant don't waste any time standing still because the world goes right on by you.  Everything else goes right on by, and you're still standing here.  You haven't improved yourself, and you gotta improve yourself, no matter how good you are at whatever you do.  It's that simple.
Story_ID: 29721
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: Yes, I would not marry at eighteen, I would not do that, no.  I love my children, and, but I would not, and they're very good kids.  I've had very bright children, very good children, and they love me very much, but I would not have done that (laughter), not again, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you look back on everything you've done to this point again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: That's a good one.  Actually, I think maybe working with the silicon process because it indirectly has touched so very many people in such a positive way.  I don't care whether anybody knows who I am or what I am or anything like that or what I had to do with it what it's done.  And it's a thing that's really made society some big, gargantuan steps in the way we live now as opposed to before we had it.
Speaker 1: Okay, you mentioned the family.  Tell us more about your family and what are your children doing and how many you have and what are they doing now?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, doing a little bit of everything actually.  I've got engineers, I've got, well, you're speaking about my children actually, not the grand kids, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you can mention them too.
Speaker 2: Well, I've got doctors, I've got dentists, I've got engineers, I got nurses.  I've got truck drivers (laughter).  I got everybody really, but they're all doing good things.  And just most recently, I've got a grandson who's fixing to become an air-- controller in the airports, you know--
Speaker 1: Air traffic controller?
Speaker 2: Air traffic controller, yeah, he just passed his test and he's going into training for that; a daughter that just got a big, she has the best one in that area, a bed and breakfast out in Petersburg, Virginia.  And so she brought an old, historic home and they re-did it and it's (unclear), oh, it's to really, really to die for.  It's a nice place.  So, all in all, I'm very happy with my life.  It's a simple life, and I wanna keep it that way.  Things have changed a lot financially, you know, and the way we were talking about, but I'm happy with where I am.
Speaker 1: Just a riff on that, just to explain that, now, you, Monsanto--was it Monsanto that had the patent for--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --yeah, for seventeen years.
Speaker 2: Seventeen years.
Speaker 1: But finally it reverted back to you, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And it's, I don't want you to tell us how much money, but it's a considerable amount of money.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: But you don't live like you have--
Speaker 2: Un-un.
Speaker 1: --you don't even live like a typical basketball player, right?
Speaker 2: And I don't want to (laughter).
Speaker 1: You live in a neighborhood.  It's a nice neighborhood.  You've live comfortable, but you're not, you don't drive a Hummer, a stretch Hummer or anything.
Speaker 2: Un-un.
Speaker 1: You're not doing those things.
Speaker 2: I don't need that to qualify me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I don't need that.
Speaker 1: Do you think if you were to be more demonstrative about what you had it would invite, you know, negative forces?
Speaker 2: It would, it would be a problem, a definite problem.  And I don't want that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, did your parents [James Alexander Collier, Sr. and Lucile Alma Collier] get a chance to see you become successful at what you were doing?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  They, I was teaching at the time they both passed away.  And I was living comfortably, but not like I could or like I am now.
Speaker 1: Would you say at the time that they passed away, you were already exceeding the expectations that they had?
Speaker 2: No, cause dad [James Alexander Collier, Sr.] was a man (unclear).  He would push you, like I said, he said, "Go, and never stop."  He wanted you to just keep going.  And mama [Lucile Alma Collier] was the same way, really.  She said, "Just learn everything you can."  And I'll never forget how he used to let me tear up things in order to see how they worked.  He brought me a brand new bicycle for Christmas, and I wanted to find out what that new departure thing worked, you know, I could break it and take, I took it apart to the ends all and everyone of those compound (washers?) in there came out.  It tilted the wrong way and they all they went (fast swishing sound) out onto the floor.  And I had no idea what the sequence was for putting them back in there.  But I knew I had to have it back in there before he got home.  I called a guy who was a bicycle mechanic.  And he came down and helped me put that thing back together.  So from that day on, I never worried about what went on back there (laughter).  I knew you pushed back and you'd stop.
Speaker 1: So your father encouraged you to go further and learn more?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he was always like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I guess it was because he didn't get that opportunity when he was growing up.
Speaker 1: You said his father was rather severe. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, oh, yes, definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything else I need to ask you before I ask my last question, any major thing?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to legacy, and it is, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I can truthfully say as a guy who loved everybody, even the guys that don't like me.  That's it.  And just, I don't have anybody I don't like.  I have some I stay away from, but I don't like them--it's not that I don't like them.  I never had any real, as I know enemies as such.  So I don't have to worry about that either.  I'd just like to be remembered as a good guy.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you, sir.  I think you will be.
Speaker 2: My pleasure, really, my pleasure.
Story_ID: 29722
Speaker 1: This is my book, my most recent one and my only one.  'Generations of Poetry' by James A. Collier.  It's called "Generations of Poetry" because my daughter and my son and one of my grandchildren have some pieces in here, and it's been out for about a month now.  And it's doing very well.  I hope you get one before they're all gone.
Speaker 2: And you did the painting on that cover?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, I did the illustration here, and it's one of our paintings and I like to paint as a hobby.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Now, that's, yes, that's called 'Tall Grass and Troy Cotton', and the meaning of that is if the grass gets taller than the cotton, you start to get out of here, and that's what he's doing (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):  Could you give us a description now?
Speaker 1: Yes, go ahead, sir.
Speaker 2: You ready?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's me playing the violin, jazz violin, with a friend of mine, Lou Taylor, and he's no longer living.  We used to play small clubs where we couldn't get a band in there, and I'd take my violin and we'd go play anyway.  So anything to make some money.
Speaker 1: About what year is this?
Speaker 2: That's about 1963.
Speaker 1: Hold on a second.  Okay, next.  Description please?
Speaker 2: Ready?
Speaker 1: Um-hum, just keep going as he puts them up there.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's myself, Nat Adderly, who is Cannonball Adderly's brother, and that's Cannonball, of course, in the background.  And we were doing a gig down in the city here.  And that would be about 1965, and we had a lot of fun with those guys.
Speaker 1: Cannonball Adderly, huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's another picture taken at about the same time, well the same night actually.  And that's Joe, "Mercy, Mercy" Joe.  Everybody knows about "Mercy, Mercy."
Speaker 1: Left to right, we're going--
Speaker 2: Left to right, that's Wheatie, Wheatie Barkley and myself, Jim Collier and I don't remember his name actually, and that's Joe.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Joe recently died too.
Speaker 1: Here we have a patent for (unclear) slicing and improving the patent on how to slice silicon without damage.  That patent belongs to me now exclusively.  Well, seventeen years ago we gave it to Monsanto, and now we have it back.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Top left first?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a picture of myself and two, three other musicians from the local.  We used to go to various churches and give short concerts on Sunday mornings.  And I don't recall all the guys' names now so I won't mention any of them.
Speaker 2: The second to the right here is Sapphire, "Something New".  We developed a way of slicing Sapphire which had never been done before, and it's-
Speaker 1: Talk about this one first.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  All right, that's myself in my music class, one of my music classes.  This is high school music class, Library High School, and we're teaching them to play music.  It's a band, a class for the wind instruments.
Speaker 1: Okay, the next one, this one.
Speaker 2: All right.  "Sapphire, Something New".  This is a process that has been recently developed, silicon on sapphire which makes for a much faster device.  And as you know, silicon is a soft material, but sapphire is one of the hardest materials next to diamond.  And we're cutting that.  It's showing some pictures of how we're cutting that.
Speaker 1: And that's a process that you developed, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Next, all right, description, please?
Speaker 2: And that's a picture of myself on a happy day of when I finished college and got my degree.
Speaker 1: And you finished college in what year?
Speaker 2: At Lane College in 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my late wife and my granddaughter.  God rest her soul, wonderful lady.
Speaker 1: Her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Elaine Collier, and she was 72 years old when she passed away.
Speaker 1: This is Young Blood Incorporated.   This is a group of young men who were from one-parent homes that we took and they all were interested in music and couldn't play a thing hardly.  We took them and trained them how to play and gave them some stage presence and in eight months' time, we had them on stage with Gladys Knight.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: And again, Young Blood Incorporated, quite a distinct bunch of young musicians.  We cleaned them up, dressed them up and gave them some musical knowledge and by now, we've got them on stage with Della Reese.
Speaker 2: Next.  Starting off to the left, clockwise.
Speaker 1: All right, we're with Jerry Rudy.  Rudy was one of the technicians out at the plant where we developed silicon process.  This is a new saw that I'm introducing to the company and it's an I.D. saw which will be used to cut silicon, and he's there with me to accept it.
Speaker 2: Top right?
Speaker 1: Again, I'm with Ron Townsend, commonly called "Head", and Ron is with the Fifth, was with the Fifth Dimensions and the remainder of these young people here, the James family was a local group that we were also training musically.
Speaker 2: Next is Red Foxx-
Speaker 1: Go to the bottom right, if you don't mind.
Speaker 2: Oh, bottom right, okay.  Red Foxx and Sugar Neal, I forget her first name, but we called her Sugar.  And Earl Neal, her husband who were local tavern owners and good friends of Red's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And again we have Red doing a performance down at the Fox Theater with his friend, the lady, and Ron [Townsend] and, of course, Slappy White, who was also a good friend and cohort of Red.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, top one first.
Speaker 2: That's me in a more pensive mood, I guess, and things were going well for us, but I was trying to think it out.
Speaker 1: And the next one is Roberta Flack.  Roberta Flack was a very good person, a good friend of ours, and we're on stage here and doing, "You Got a Friend".
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Here we have Dr. Dean Scrubs Gearbro (ph.), Dr. Utley, myself and Hubert Humphrey, the Honorable Hubert Humphrey who was the vice president of the United States at that particular time.  We're out on the (unclear) stump, so to speak, to get votes out and to get people to vote Democratic.
