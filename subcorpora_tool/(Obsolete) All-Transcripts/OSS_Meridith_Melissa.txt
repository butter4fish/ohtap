 Finchum Today is May 5, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum and along with me is Dr. Charles Abramson. We are with Oklahoma State University, and today we are in the Office of the President of the University to speak with Melissa Meridith. This is part of our gathering the history of the Phi Beta Kappa chapter here on campus, so thank you for having us today.  Meridith Sure   Finchum Let   s learn a little bit about you first, starting with when and where you were born.  Meridith Okay. I was born in Enid, Oklahoma, in 1977, and grew up in Garber, Oklahoma.  Finchum Do you have brothers and sisters?  Meridith I do. I have seven, so I have five brothers and two sisters.  Finchum Where are you in the order?  Meridith I am in the middle. I have three above and four below.  Finchum Ah   Meridith It   s fun.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Meridith My dad is a wheat farmer and runs a few cows too, and cattle. My mom was a stay-at-home mom, most of the time, with that many kids. 5  Finchum With that many children, yeah.  Meridith Quite the job, yes. (Laughs)  Finchum Well then, agriculture-related, were you in 4-H or FFA?  Meridith I wasn   t, funnily enough. Just, I guess, got my fill of it living on the farm and so did other things in school.  Finchum Well, on the farm, did you have chores you had to do, or did you get out of those things?  Meridith No. Daddy always came in on Saturday mornings and if it was past seven, wondered what we were all doing sleeping in so late. I know dairy farmers get up a lot earlier than that and some others, so I guess we got lucky in that regard. Always had to help run the tractor, or drive the wheat truck, or help sort cows, or   .  Finchum How old were you when you drove the tractor the first time?  Meridith I don   t know that I know. I think as soon as you   re tall enough to see over the steering wheel and reach the pedals at the same time, then you   re in a vehicle of some sort.  Finchum Before you got your driver   s license at sixteen, I assume?  Meridith Yes, yes  (Laughter)  Finchum Well, had your parents gone to college?  Meridith Yes, my dad came here to OSU, and was also an AGR here at OSU, with Gary Clark actually. My mom did not.  Finchum Okay. Do you remember what year he graduated from here?  Meridith I don   t. I should know that, but I don   t off the top of my head.  Finchum We can look, and what was his name?  Meridith John Oldham.  Finchum Well, we can look it up. In high school, did you have a favorite subject?  Meridith I don   t think so. I always enjoyed math, but I don   t think I had a favorite other than that. 6  Finchum I guess I should ask where you graduated from high school. I   m assuming Garber High.  Meridith Yes, Garber High School.  Finchum And what year?  Meridith Nineteen ninety-five.  Finchum And then elementary school?  Meridith I actually went to elementary school in Enid for a few years, so   but then finished up at Garber. We lived out on the farm in Garber.  Finchum I   m not sure where Garber is.  Meridith It is about fifteen minutes, or fifteen miles, to east and a little bit north of Enid.  Finchum Well, not too far from here.  Meridith No, it   s about a forty-five minute or an hour drive.  Finchum On a wheat farm, I   m curious, did you drive a combine?  Meridith I have really bad, like hay fever allergies, so I always got out of most of the wheat harvesting piece of it. I could drive a tractor because that   s just dirt, and so there   s no severe allergies to that. The wheat dust just always bothered me too much, and I had enough brothers and sisters that I managed to get out of that one, so.     Finchum When you weren   t helping your dad on the farm, what would you do for fun?  Meridith In Garber, there   s not a whole lot. During the summers, I was a lifeguard at a local   there in Garber one year, but then Billings too. Billings, Oklahoma, is not too far from where we lived.  Finchum Okay, now I know where that is. That   s where the Bellmons are.  Meridith Yes, yes  My parents    farm is right between Garber and Billings. We happened to be right on the line of the Garber School District so we went to school there.  Finchum Do they still have the farm?  7  Meridith They do. Yes.  Finchum It   s still growing wheat, or not canola?  Meridith There   s a lot of canola in the area, and soy beans, and a lot more corn too, but Daddy   s pretty much stuck to the wheat farming.  Finchum I noticed the canola is pretty this time, with the yellows.  Meridith It is. It   s beautiful.  Finchum I imagine you   d probably be allergic to that too.  Meridith Probably. (Laughs) I haven   t ever been involved in that, but   .  Finchum Okay, once you finished high school, take us through your     Meridith I came to OSU, and went to school here, and graduated in 2001. I took a few detours along the way, but graduated in 2001 with a degree.  Finchum In what? What did you finally settle on?  Meridith Business management is what I majored in, and then worked here locally for a company for a few years. Then, went to work for OSU in, I looked it up so I   d have it, in 2007.  Finchum When you were a student here, where did you live?  Meridith I lived in the dorm, in Kerr-Drummond, for two years actually, and then moved off-campus with some friends I went to school at Garber with, actually. We had just a rent house here in town.  Finchum Did your siblings before you come to OSU as well?  Meridith I   m sorry?  Finchum Your siblings before you come to OSU too?  Meridith No. My two older brothers didn   t, and my older sister went to OU. I know, she was a traitor, but she had a boyfriend that she followed to Norman, so that   s how that works sometimes. (Laughs)  Finchum So you   re the first in the family to follow your dad here?  Meridith Yes, uh-huh.  8  Finchum What about the younger ones?  Meridith No, they all went different directions as well.  Finchum Okay. He gave you opportunities to choose where you wanted to go then. It wasn   t required to come here necessarily.  Meridith Yes, no. That   s right.  Finchum When you graduated, did they have the ceremony in      Meridith It was on the football field still.  Finchum Football field, okay. Not in the arena.  Meridith It was hot that year. It wasn   t raining, which was good, but it was hot. (Laughs)  Finchum Were you involved with activities on campus?  Meridith I wasn   t. I worked most of the time, so I just worked my way through school, so I just wasn   t as involved on campus.  Finchum Would you go home very often?  Meridith I didn   t as much when I was in college as I do now. I go home a lot more now, on the weekends, to kind of help on the farm and do what I can, but I kind of enjoyed my space, I guess, away from all my brothers and sisters. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you come with a car      Meridith Yes      Finchum     or did you have to hitch a ride back and forth?  Meridith No, I had a car. (Laughs)  Finchum We   ve had stories of people hitchhiking, so that   s why I ask.  Meridith I had actually bought it from my grandma, so it was an older car, but I had a car, so it was good.  Finchum Did you have a favorite professor?  Meridith No, not that I recall. 9  Finchum They would probably still be here, if you did..  Meridith They might, yeah.  Finchum You became   started to work here in the president   s office in    07?  Meridith I started at OSU in    07 in the chemical engineering department. That   s where I was hired in at. Then, came over here to the president   s office in 2010, so I   ve been here since 2010.  Finchum That   s about six years.  Meridith Yes  Yeah.  Finchum In a typical day, what do you do here?  Meridith My responsibilities in this office are the president   s calendar, Mrs. Hargis    calendar, and Gary Clark   s calendar. I also sit at the front desk, and so handle all the incoming mail, and just foot traffic, and phone calls.  Finchum Not really a typical day then?  Meridith There is not usually a typical day, but the typical day is just the unknown. I mean, it   s just always changing. As long as you go with the flow, then you   re okay.  Finchum In 2010, the application was already in process by that point, or at least they   d tried a couple and they were moving towards the last one, for Phi Beta Kappa. Do you recall how you initially got involved with that part?  Meridith How I initially got involved was the committee had met several times in our office. The Bobs, Bob Graalman and Bob Sternburg, and there were several of those. They had met in our office several times, and I think one of the last times, we were getting down fairly close to the site visit, Gary Clark realized there hadn   t been a lot of legwork done on any of the specific details regarding the site visit. He came out with that and said,    We need some help.    (Laughs) So that   s how I got involved.  Finchum The Bobs. How many Bobs were there? Graalman     Meridith Three, I think. Bob Spurrier, and Bob Graalman, and     Abramson Bob Miller.  Meridith    Bob Sternberg, right, and Bob Miller. Four, there were   yes  10  Finchum We   ll change your name, Charles. (Laughter)  Abramson No, I like Charles. I   ll keep that, and Sternberg came late to the process.  Meridith He did.  Finchum What were some of the hurdles that you had to help with?  Meridith The biggest thing, I think, was just the number of people that they needed to see in the kind of two full days that they were here. I mean, I think they came in an evening, and then were here two full days. There were just a lot of key people on campus that they needed to see in that timeframe, and so there wasn   t a lot of time for people to shift their schedules, or not be available. They just   and people, I think, understood coming from the president   s office   that helps a lot when you have a signature that says Office of the President, that this is important.  They needed to adjust their schedules to accommodate us in this case, and to accommodate the visit, and not the other way around. There wasn   t going to be a,    I can   t do it that day. We   ll have to do it some other time.    For that many people, it gets pretty tricky. You kind of don   t give options. Dr. Crauder, I think, came back after and wanted to know, what   how did I word those emails that I got all those people to be there when I wanted them to be there? (Laughs) Because there wasn   t a lot of wiggle room, I mean, just with that many people, and that small amount of time, we didn   t have a lot of wiggle room for offering options.  Finchum Roughly how many people?  Meridith I would say between seventy-five and a hundred, and some of them met in groups. I think there was a lunch with maybe the department heads, and those sorts of things, but some of them were ones and twos that we just grouped together. They   d maybe meet for thirty minutes, and then we would have the next ones set up to come in right behind them.  Finchum You arranged all of that?  Meridith Yes, and there   s a lot of little things sometimes. Like the escorts, making sure there   s somebody there when those meetings are over to take them to the next place, so they know where they   re going. A lot of times, because we don   t have time for them to spend a lot of time figuring out where they   re going, we just need to be able to walk them from one place to the next. I think we wanted them to see campus, but we didn   t want to parade them around campus the whole time, because we had such a small amount 11  of time. Just trying to figure out logistics of where   which buildings we wanted them to be in for those meetings, but still be able to see campus too.  Finchum Used Ann   s taxi  golf cart of First Cowgirl Ann Hargis  a little bit?  Meridith I don   t know that we ever did. I think there were four or five of them, maybe five that came for the site visit, so it was more than we could accommodate in her taxi. I think we got lucky on the weather too, and I think it was fairly nice, and so they could just walk.  Finchum That brings us to the topic of weather that you wanted to ask.  Abramson We heard that the hotel where they were going to stay did not have air conditioning, it didn   t work.  Meridith Yes. We had them booked at the Atherton, which is very convenient. Being right here on campus it means they didn   t have to come from off campus. However, they were working on the vent system, or whatever the cooling system is. The air was going to be off, and it was early enough in the spring, I think they were hoping (was it in the spring, I   m losing track now) that it was going to be cool enough, but it just wasn   t going to be. Someone from the Student Union or the Atherton went and bought five air conditioning units to put in their five hotel rooms.  You could tell   if you   re in the formal gardens, and you looked up, there   s this nice pretty hotel, and there   s just five windows that have air conditioning units sticking out of them, so we knew exactly where their rooms were from that. (Laughs) And I felt bad for any other guests that were there that didn   t get the luxury of a (laughs) window unit. It was very accommodating of them to do that so that we didn   t have grumpy site visitors to start with, so that was an important piece.  Finchum Did you have any more involvement other than saying,    We need this done   ?  Meridith No, I didn   t. I mean, I didn   t actually have to go buy them or anything. We had somebody else that handled that, worried about getting them installed, and so that was just another example of the campus being very accommodating and recognizing what an important visit this was.  Finchum Do any of the guests stand out, of these five or six that came?  Meridith I don   t remember anyone in particular standing out, which is probably good. That means there wasn   t anyone upset. Usually if something   s wrong, it stands out in your mind, so I don   t remember anyone particular standing out.  12  Finchum No other major hiccups besides that?  Meridith Not that I can remember, so that   s good.  Abramson How about the Xeroxing of the applications? Did you have anything to do with putting it together?  Meridith I don   t think I did, and I wondered about that. Who was involved in that piece of it? If it was Christy Hawkins    office maybe, she   s usually the ones that   s real involved with anything that has to do with numbers. Her office gets to generate those.  Abramson Because we asked Bruce  Crauder , and he didn   t remember.  Meridith Doing it? I wonder if it was Dr. Graalman.  Abramson He will be interviewed next year. Yeah, you   re the last one for the semester.  Meridith I don   t think we had to. We made a couple of copies, just kind of in-house to have on hand, but we weren   t   I don   t think we were involved in if we had to make mass copies of it. That wasn   t   maybe that was Dr. Graalman   s office.  Finchum Scheduling that many was more effort than copying, I guess, too.  Meridith It was a little panicking at first. Just realizing that we had all these people that they needed to see in that amount of time, but it came together really well. We even had a reception, I think, for all of the Phi Beta Kappa members, I guess you would call them, that are current faculty and staff members that first night that they were here. We had invitations that needed to go out to all of those people, and it turned out good, I think.  Finchum This was the first site visit too, period, wasn   t it? The first time they come, so you didn   t have any     Meridith    anything to compare it to, right. I think a lot of probably departments do a little bit similar when they interview faculty, or department heads, or VPs. We kind of set up the different lunches, and the breakfasts with the different groups, and those sorts of things. It   s a little bit similar, but this one was just a much more important, and a much more broad array of people that they needed to meet with on campus.  Finchum They came and went with not much fanfare?  13  Meridith As I remember, yes. I think they were here, and we were all   I was nervous, anyway, about everything working okay, and them being in the right place, but I think it seemed to work okay.  Finchum Do you recall where you were when you got the word that the chapter had been awarded to here?  Meridith I would have been out here at the front desk, (laughs) but I don   t remember if it was Gary Clark that probably came out and gave the good news. That   s probably where that came from, if I remember.  Finchum Have you been involved with it much since?  Meridith Yes, we   ve stayed involved with the annual induction ceremonies. We   ve helped make sure that all the details for that are arranged and the program is put together, and the catering for the event and just making sure that   s   we   ve worked with Dr. Gethner a lot on that.  Finchum And the budget, is that part of what the president   s office does?  Abramson A part of it. There   s also the endowment by Dean Stringer, and Perry Gethner has put something in as well, so it   s a group effort.  Meridith It is a group effort, yes. (Laughs)  Abramson Did you hear of Phi Beta Kappa before all this?  Meridith I don   t think I had. Of course, being in the business school, it wouldn   t have been   .  Finchum Well, and there wasn   t one     Meridith Right, on campus.  Finchum    here. Charles knew about it from movies.  Abramson Well, yeah. From movies, and if you like old movies, like The Tin Man for example, they   re always talking about Phi Beta Kappa.  Meridith Okay.  Abramson And the game shows. You know, the game shows at the time would say,    Well, this person   s Phi Beta Kappa,    and some people when they die, it is put on their tombstone.  Meridith Really? 14  Abramson They have a long, very long history. We   ve tried, as you know, many times to try to get the chapter here. It was probably over about a thirty-year effort, and finally we broke through.  Meridith Yes, which was great.  Finchum When you get involved with it, did they explain some of the background, some of the history of this effort?  Meridith I don   t know that there was a lot of time. It was more of a,    This is really important. We need to take   this is your number one priority  I don   t know what you   re doing, but this is now what you   re doing.    I think I just understood from the committee that had met and just stories I   d   little stories, bits in here, of how important this was, and how close we were, and everybody   s fingers crossed that this time it would come together the way they hoped it would.  Finchum How much lead time did you have from,    Okay, we got to get this        Meridith It was about a week and a half, if I remember right. It was not very much time, and that   s where   I don   t remember having very many problems getting people to agree to meet when we needed them too. I think there was maybe one professor, that also taught in Tulsa, that we had a little bit of trouble with. Not with the professor, but just     Finchum Getting him here?  Meridith    yes, getting the schedule shuffled around enough that yes, she could be here when we needed her to be, so it was exciting, (laughs) and then it was over.  Finchum Did you attend the reception when the group was here?  Meridith I didn   t attend the group reception. We had a small reception after the site visit, I think, just to thank everybody for the time and effort and work they   d put into both the application and the site visit. We had a small reception after   I think before we knew that we   d got it. It was just more of a thank you for all the   because it was kind of out of our hands at that point. They had come and gone, and it was out of our control. We had a small thank you, so I went to that one.  Abramson Was that in the hotel?  Meridith It was.  15  Abramson That   s when I got the football tickets  (Laughter) Yes, I think it was when President Hargis asked what would I like, football tickets.  Meridith There you go. Okay, so was there a particular game?  Abramson I just wanted to sit in the president   s box. My wife is always asking that. I don   t know if you   ve met my wife, but she knows President Hargis pretty well, and she so says,    Well, if Dr. Chaney can get seats, how come you can   t?    (Laughter) This was my chance, so for me that little gathering was really important.  Meridith That was the bonus, huh? (Laughs)  Finchum Well, did you, were you involved with arranging for the group to go to Florida for the     Meridith Yes.  Finchum For the   .  Meridith Since I handled the president   s calendar, it just kind of fell in line with my responsibilities for that. We just helped make sure we were at the right hotel, and everybody was going to be there when they needed to be there. That was exciting, I think. Kind of one of the final steps in the process, so that was a fun time.  Finchum A little bit of a celebration in the office the next day or two?  Meridith Right, yes   Abramson After you found out that we earned a chapter, did the office change a little bit? Did people have more smiles on their faces, and   .  Meridith I think everybody was pretty relieved that it was   yes, that we had done it. Yes, that it had finally, like we   d crossed that, because I think it had been done several times before, and a big sense of relief too, that it had been accomplished.  Finchum Any additional mail or visitors for congratulating and that type of thing?  Meridith I think when they gave the honorary memberships, or I don   t know what you call them, to Gary Clark and President Hargis because they weren   t   they didn   t have a Phi Beta Kappa designation or a status, so they were given honorary memberships to Phi Beta Kappa. I think they were both very humbled and very honored to receive that. I remember that being a big deal. They presented them kind of a framed piece for that, and President Hargis    16  still hangs back on the wall, back there in his hallway to his office. That was a pretty big deal. I remember that being just a neat thing for those two to have been a part of.  Finchum And then there   s one hanging over in, you said, Life Science East?  Abramson Yeah, that   s our charter.  Meridith Oh, the actual charter? Okay, neat.  Finchum I guess you were aware of that, or if not, you know now. (Laughs)  Meridith Yeah, I do know now   Finchum And they   re getting ready to induct the next round. Are you involved with that any?  Meridith Just again helping set up to make sure we have the room, and the catering, and the programs. Gary Clark has stayed very involved in trying to help get the word out to these students because, I think, it   s still so new to OSU   s campus. There   s not a huge understanding with the students of what Phi Beta Kappa is, and so he has tracked down emails, and tracked down cell phones. If he couldn   t get ahold of them that way, he has called to find out who their advisors are, or who some of their professors are that they can get in contact with those students to try and let them know what a huge honor this is and what a great thing it would be for them, that there   s no downside. He   s really done a lot of legwork this last time.  I think Dr. Gethner said that this year was one of our highest. Of the thirty or thirty-five that had been selected to receive it, this year has been the highest acceptance rate, and I think Gary Clark has been a big piece of that. We sent   I know an email came out from President Hargis, along with Dr. Gethner, their original offer or acceptance letter, and then a follow-up from President Hargis, and then another follow-up from Gary Clark, and then phone calls after that. There   s been a lot of work done from this office in general, just to try and   they also hosted a reception out at the president   s home for those students to try and just imprint on them what a huge honor it is.  Finchum This kind of stays in the back of your head through the entire year, I guess?  Meridith It does, yes.  Finchum It   s not just one and done.  Meridith No. We revisit it every year, which is good. 17  Finchum Getting air conditioning though, I   m sure, was the major coup in a way.  Abramson We know that Gary Clark certainly appreciated your efforts.  Meridith Good, thank you.  Abramson It all makes a difference. It really was a group effort.  Meridith It was, and I think everybody, again, on campus understood that, and I think realized the president   s recognition of   that this was important, that this was something that we needed to do and became a whole, campus-wide group effort.  Abramson I   m sure you know that many people, myself included when I came here, just assumed that OSU had a Phi Beta Kappa because it   s a great university and a lot of plusses here. It was very surprising when we found out that it didn   t.  Meridith And one of the last ones in the Big Twelve I think too, right, to get one, to have a designation?  Abramson Right, I believe so, and if OU and Tulsa can have   .  Meridith Then how do we not? Yes   Finchum Well, your siblings that went to OU, were they a member of it there? Do you know?  Meridith I don   t believe so. My sister that went there is a teacher now, and so I don   t think... and she   s an elementary teacher.  Finchum You were business, so you wouldn   t have necessarily been either. Me either. (Laughter) I was social work, so I   m sure I wouldn   t be either.  Abramson I think Gary Clark   wasn   t he an ag undergraduate?  Meridith He was.  Abramson He wouldn   t have   .  Meridith Yeah, he started out as an ag teacher.  Finchum Yeah, then President Hargis was business, I think...  Meridith Accounting.  18  Finchum    accounting. Honorary is good.  Abramson Yeah, honorary   s good, well-earned.  Finchum Anything else?  Abramson Not for me. Do you have any questions for us?  Meridith I don   t think so.  Finchum Plan to be here for quite a while longer?  Meridith I do. Yes.  Finchum Go pokes then, and     Meridith That   s right   Finchum    we   ll say thank you.  Meridith Yes, thank you. (Laughter)  -------  -------
