 Wilson  Heiskell  Today is April 9, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I am just outside of Mangum today, talking with Ilka  Heiskell at her home, with a beautiful view. I am interviewing Ilka as  part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Series. Thank you for  having me in your home.  You are very welcome.  To start out with, would you tell me when and where you were born?  Certainly. I was born on April 13, 1961, to Richard and Edith Vanner. I  am the third of four girls, but there was a boy just prior to me. He died of  crib death, so I did not know him. I was born in Wiesbaden. I grew up in  the oldest part of Wiesbaden called the Igstadt.  Which means    the old city   ?     The oldest part of town,    yes.  Were you born in a hospital?  Yes, I was. I was born at the   it was called at the time die St  dtische  Kliniken. Nowadays, they named it after somebody, and then I don   t  know his name. (Laughter) But, yes, in a hospital.  What were your parents    professions?  I am not sure what my mom was, other than being a homemaker, at the  time that I came along, but my dad was kind of like a deacon/social  worker for a large Lutheran church, as well as a local politician.  5  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  What was the name of the Lutheran Church?  Oh, it is called die Baak Kirche, and it literally sits up on a little hill in  Wiesbaden, downtown. I grew up on a street named Steingasse, which  had, still, cobblestones, and very rich in local traditions. The area  actually is called die katze loch, which translated would mean something  such as    the cat hole,    which sounds kind of odd, but the houses were so  small that they used to joke that cats could just jump over them.  Growing up in that part of Wiesbaden, every summer we had weekly  carnivals that literally traveled from one street to the next, to the next, so  for three weeks we had carnivals on three different streets you could  literally walk to, you know, big German carnivals.  So would they have rides at these carnivals?  They sure would. At the end, they would burn something made to look  like a black cat with a     Oh, with his back arched?  An arched back, yes, yes. That was the sacrificial something. But  anyway, I grew up in this old part of town in which the needs were great.  How old were you when you started to school?  I started school at approximately five years old. I was gone for six weeks  for health reasons. We go to cure, is what we call it. At the time that I  grew up in the    60s and    70s, Germans very into taking care of children.  Due to the fact that I was slightly pale and small, apparently I needed to  be sent away for six weeks to be taken care of and see if I could maybe  fatten up a little, so I missed the official testing for our elementary  school. But again, since I was the third of four girls, I was taken into the  principal. My dad sat there. They showed me a couple of pictures, and I  was supposed to explain to them what children   s stories they were,  Brothers Grimm   s books and what have you. After I gave the  deliberation of what I thought I ought to be saying, I was enrolled.  (Laughter) Back in those days, things were still easy without all the  paperwork and so forth. Plus, the school was literally two houses behind  the house I grew up in, might have helped.  So were you supposed to already have an understanding of these tales     Oh, yes. Oh, yes.     or were you supposed to read them?  6  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  No, just tricks playing. I guess lesson learned, per se. But again, I also  went to kindergarten and have always been in social settings in regards  of children.  Did most German children, were they raised with these Brothers  Grimm   s tales and     Oh, yes. All sorts of custom in tales in this and that, and I guess it was  just used to see how far was I to explain whether it was verbal or any  other. I guess I passed because I started school. (Laughter) Maybe not as  good as the older sister, but I certainly started.  I guess you would walk to school since it was two houses away?  Yes, all I had to do was go out the back door and go through the little  area from the church where all the people parked that had cars back in  those days, and I was at school. I could actually slide home during break  and pick something up if I so forgot, or not.  Would you come home to eat lunch, or did you eat at the school?  Actually, school would be over about one o   clock. In elementary school,  school was out by one. During the time when my mom was still alive, of  course, I went home. Then after that, I would go to an after-school care  class that was also housed in the same building as which I grew up in for  the rest of the afternoon.  So being in elementary school in the    60s, were they talking about the  World Wars in your classes?  I don   t recall that we talked about any of the worldly issues in  elementary school. During that time, we learned about our most local  area, about that my hometown has been around since before Christ was  born. I come from a very historically rich area. We have a Roman wall  that is still standing, built by the Romans. Romans used to come to  Wiesbaden, i.e., it   s named after wiese bade. Latin, that stands for    the  city of five springs.    To this day, my hometown is a world renowned spa  town due to its hot thermal springs against rheumatoid arthritis and all  sorts of other ailments. We learned about our history, per se, for our city  and then for our state and then maybe venture out and learned about  other states. Elementary school was primarily to learn about the most  local things around and the history as it pertains to Germans, where we  came from and such.  What state is Wiesbaden in?  7  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wiesbaden is the capital of the state of Hesse, which I would call is  located in central Germany. Most Americans might be familiar with  Frankfurt (in German accent), or as Americans like to say, Frankfurt, (in  American accent) which holds the international airport. Even though  Frankfurt is in Hessen, Wiesbaden is its capital. It   s about thirty-five  minutes, by car, northwest of Frankfurt. Wiesbaden, itself, lies on one  side. We   re surrounded by the Rhine River and all the wineries and all  the medieval castles, and on the other side by the so-called Taunus  Mountains, so we have a continuous airflow coming freshly into the  town.  Very good air.  Yes. It used to be a very rich town because back in the day of the  Kaisers and Kings, that   s where they would hobnob is literally on the big  roads with all the wonderful goodies.  So Wiesbaden has fresh air and     Yes. Wiesbaden is a very interesting town because various national  things happened there, from the Iranian hostage crisis, when they were  released were flown to Wiesbaden to the American medical facility  before they were debriefed and then flown back to the States. Wiesbaden  is known for the German Clinic of Diagnostics, for the German version  of the FBI, etcetera. All those things are housed in my hometown.  Did your grandparents live near you?  That   s a good question. I   ve only met my grandmother on my mother   s  side once. By the time I came along, there were no grandparents left on  my father   s side because he was quite old as a father.  Do you want to talk a little more about your father?  I could. He was born in 1907 in Hamburg, which is way up north, and  apparently lived an interesting life. I have learned over the last twenty  years by getting articles out of my hometown   s archives that not just was  he ahead of his time, but he wanted to make a difference. He would   ve  liked to be a social worker, but back in those days men did not do such  things, so he became a bookkeeper/accountant. He was always involved  in community activities or making changes or helping to make changes.  During a politically interesting time in Germany, which was between  World War I and World War II, was what we would refer to as the  Weimar Republic, which I guess I would translate into a time of political  unrest and political ambition, just people stepping forward, coming from  the Kaiser time and Kings, and wanting to make it more of a democracy  8  Wilson  Heiskell  and being part of.  During that time, my dad seemingly ran for office for the German  Democrats. Of course, they did not make it because Hitler came to  power. During that time when Hitler came to power, I guess my dad  learned some very valuable lessons in regards to integrity, honesty, and  all those wonderful traits that humans generally would have. After the  Nazis came to power, he got to see the falseness of people and also his  former so-called friends who were real quick in turning people in that  they knew had run for office for a different party, in my dad   s case, the  Democrats. He was also a big labor union activist, so when the Nazis  came to power, that wasn   t a good time for him.  All I remember as a child, on certain Sundays we   d always have a big,  big Sunday lunch later in the afternoon after church and what have you.  Sometimes my parents would discuss or talk about things, and so there  are a couple of stories I remember as a child, one of them being about  something called roaches (of course, they were called kakerlaken) and  how they would try to catch them because they had no foods. We really  couldn   t visualize because I had never seen a roach in my life until I  came to Texas. (Laughter) Then I was told it   s a German roach, and I  went,    No, no, no, no  I   ve never seen such a thing. Surely not      (Laughter)  Apparently my dad, who was socially minded from early childhood on,  found Christ during World War II in the worst of internment camps by,  as it is written, falling into the midst of this group in which he  recognized the same kind of engagement in wanting to make a  difference, as he had seen with his politically likeminded friends.  Somehow that exposure brought him to become a Christian. After World  War II ended, everything that he was used to was bombed out up in  Hamburg. A friend, his best friend at the time, a Lutheran minister who  had also followed the teachings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, was a German  theologian that kept speaking out against just following blindly Hitler,  that he was not the anointed one, but that we as Christians are  responsible for our own actions and to make our own choices and to live  your faith rather than to follow. This fine minister, Hahoensene, asked  my dad to follow him to Wiesbaden and help work in this awesome,  huge church with a huge congregation in this old part of Wiesbaden. So  I am the daughter of a proud person from Hamburg, but I personally am  from Wiesbaden, born and raised.  Were all of your sisters also born in Wiesbaden?  Yes, all of us are born and raised in Wiesbaden.  9  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  And he continued to work in that church?  Oh, yes. Until he died, he certainly did. His evenings from five o   clock  on were always   every evening, I would call him a cab. I still remember  the number. It   s still valid today. (Laughter) My dad never drove.  Always took public transportation, walked, or a cab. He would spend his  evenings in all these different pages    and pages    worth of titles and  membership of committees and what have you. His passion in life was to  speak up for the voiceless, children, and the elderly.  That   s all I remember is truly seeing my dad in action in what we would  call Citizen Bureau once a month. No, actually, every two weeks. It  would be open, and all the citizens was in your district, what have you,  would come in if they had complaints or,    Can you help me with this?     It was truly democracy in action as I come to think of it in today   s  world, that everybody had a voice, and if need be, he was the one who  would speak up and take care of issues. I am my father   s daughter  except for one thing: He was a man of few words, and that   s not quite  the way I am. (Laughter)  But he was definitely a role model and had a big effect on     Oh, yes, very much so, and the older I am, the more it   s become aware  as to whose daughter I am.  Well, then you went through the school system, and at what grade did  you move to another school?  Well, I went through fourth grade to an elementary school. I went one  year to a school that was local, but my dad enrolled me in the newest  school form at the time which we would call a Gesamtschule. If I was to  translate it, it would be a comprehensive school in which all three school  forms are combined that Germany has. Maybe in today   s world I   d call  it a magnet school as various states have, in which you can take certain  electives to get to different areas within the education system but yet still  receive your certificate at the end of it.  I just recently learned that German teachers flew to the United States to  get the idea of these specific schools, and now I   m trying to become a  speaker for one of them in Arkansas. Life just is very interesting in how  things come full circle. My dad enrolled me in the Gesamtschule  Klarenthal, the comprehensive school, which took about an hour each  way with two different buses for me to attend, but he fully believed in  the opportunities that this particular, at the time, brand new form of  school had. I even have a newspaper article,    Your Representative   s  Moment,    in which it is written that he believed in it so very much that  10  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  he enrolled his daughter, Ilka, to attend that school. Back in those days, I  thought,    Darn, that   s a long drive.    (Laughter)  The school (I guess you would call it middle school and high school)  was located in a suburb of Wiesbaden called Klarenthal. Klarenthal was  one of the first suburbs that people that moved from the city in which  they did not have bathrooms in their apartments, or the toilet was on the  half-floor that you shared with others. I mean, it was slightly old  fashioned. People moved out to these suburbs and got substitute  housings, and others moved to the area because they could actually  afford a piece of land with a little house on it. But every street in that  suburb is named after a World War II Resistance Fighter, whether it was  Jewish Resistance, German Resistance, what have you. Those people did  exist, and so that whole suburb is named after all those fine people.  Growing up, we were always surrounded by reminders of Germans  passed, or as we call it in this country, the sins of our fathers, to which I  can smile and say I happen to know that my dad was not part of it. I  proudly hold my head because of it because he already swam against the  stream when it wasn   t popular.  Did you learn much about the people who these streets were named after  in your school?  Yes. Oh, yes. Yes. Being the generation that I am, born in    61, going to  school in the    70s and high school in the    70s, we were actually taught  by the survivors of World War II, were raised by the survivors, and  taught. In this particular school system, most of the teachers volunteered  to be part of, so they were highly innovative, highly useful. I remember  various teachers. We   d go to concerts, open air concerts, and call them  by first names. Of course, once we were back in school it was officially     Herr    and    Frau,    whatever their names were. We were raised by  slightly outside-the-box-thinking generation.  Were there a lot of new lessons learned in this generation or things  passed down from...  In regards to history, we as students at the time were like,    Not again.     Every year, we literally had a unit of   we would call this Das Dritte  Reich, The Third Reich. We would call it World War II, but, of course,  from the German point of view and how it should never ever happen  again and how could it have happened. So my generation I refer to as the  one that was raised to question everything, to never follow blindly, to  never sign anything unless you question. People who want your date of  birth and all these other, they need to tell me what they need it for before  I will depart with that information so that it could never happen again,  the apathy of politics.  11  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  So when did you graduate from high school?  Seventy-nine.  Did you go through the thirteenth grade?  No, I did twelve. Yes, I did go through thirteen by circumstance of  attending a few additional schools. I guess I   ve always wondered,    Who  do I want to be when I grow up?    I kind of knew, but then I didn   t, so I  took any kind of schooling that came my way, whether it was public  speaking, whether it was theater and arts, or literature, or in this case,  padagogik, the signs of teaching. Any of those have always appealed to  me greatly. When I came to the United States in 1983, one of my first  jobs that I got hired for was as a teacher and    principal    to help set up a  pre-school in Killeen, Texas, for a Lutheran church. However, then  came the military, and my husband at the time got orders, blah, blah,  blah, blah. Three months later, I was in Kentucky and in Alabama.  Schooling or education or passing it on is something that matters to me.  Did you study English throughout your schooling?  Good question. Yes and no, I suppose. I started English classes as of  fifth grade, but, of course, it was British English, such as to go    daun-cing     and    po-tah-toes    and all this, nowhere near as fluent as I   m  speaking it currently. But by the time I was in high school with  American songs and all of that, we did learn English, and that was just  our first foreign language. Then you took French, and different ones  took Latin. I chose English and French rather than the old Latin, Greek,  all of that. Those were the choices I made. (Laughs)  Were there many Americans around that you interacted with throughout  your years growing up?  No. Growing up, it was kind of like you   re in a bubble. As a child, you  are in as much of a bubble as wherever you   re around. In my case, the  bubble was a little larger because of my dad   s activities on the political  side of the house. I went to all sorts of openings of this and theater plays.  Politicians back in those days got lots of free tickets, and we went. We  have one of the largest state theaters, again, very proper, very bling-bling  and what have you. We   re talking times of Kaisers and Kings that  are accustomed to specific things. That   s kind of the environment we  grew up in. In Germany, we do not have a prom. What we do instead is  in tenth grade we go to dance classes. After ten sessions, you have a big  ball in exactly one of those settings. That   s what I would compare our  prom to is like our big dance balls to which the parents take you. You  12  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  get to dance your first formal dance with your dad. Even though it   s  different, it   s kind of the same.  So there weren   t American military bases around you?  There apparently were, but as a child I did not know. We did have one  racially mixed girl that joined our class like in fourth grade. I, for my  part, thought,    How cool, she has curls.    Remember, what one doesn   t  have, we all want. Not just did she have the finest looking, milky,  chocolate-colored skin, but she had these awesome curls and afro. Of  course, none of us had that, so what there is not, we would all like to be.  That was probably the most exotic I   ve ever seen anybody, and yet she  spoke just as fluent German as I did because of her mom. So, no, we  were not aware of Americans at that time as such. I mean, you saw the  news and what have you, but one of the biggest influential things I  remember watching or being aware of is man landing on the moon and  when President Kennedy got shot. Those two were pretty pivotal, also,  in Germany.  So you watched the coverage on television on the news?  Yes. Yes. It seemed so Utopian back then.  Did you listen to the radio much in the    60s and    70s?  Well, yes. We really did not own a TV. My dad did not drive. He did not  believe in TVs. We did believe in radios, though, and so we listened, and  we were big readers. Then later on somebody gave us a TV where one  station worked. (Laughs) We were aware of things, but not in our  everyday life. We lived a German everyday life. It wasn   t until later on  that you realized there is so much more out there, in going to summer  camps. First you do it in Germany, and then we went to Denmark and  Sweden and England. Being in Germany, you become accustomed to  traveling because Germany is so small comparatively to the US. Back in  my day, Texas was two and a half times the size of Germany, so if I  decide to go from Oklahoma to Colorado, well, in Germany, that would  mean I   d be in Austria, in Switzerland, in Italy, wherever I may choose.  In the college days, I decide on a Friday,    I   ll go skiing,    so I pack up  my gear, drive to Austria, and go skiing. To Americans in general, that  seems a bit farfetched, but if you relate it into the sense of different  states being countries, then they understand that it   s really not that far.  It   s just so much closer but yet different cultures, different language,  different everything, which I believe gives us also, as Germans, a wide  appreciation of different cultures because we   re surrounded by different  cultures.  13  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Did you hear much about East Germany?  Yes. The Wall went up six months after my birthday, August 13, 1961.  Growing up, all German churches had East German partner churches.  For specific holidays we would collect from the congregation things and  then mail them. I   ve also had the pleasure of my second bonus dad,  foster father, was a Lutheran minister of whom I lived as their daughter  for four years. I became the oldest of three boys. Yes  (Laughter) We  actually went for one week to East Germany, first to Magdeburg and  then to Crimmitschau, to visit two different Lutheran churches. Under  the Communist rule, any believer could actually leave East Germany.  Any minister could leave, but that was the opposite of what they wanted  to do. They stayed to teach the message of the Bible and of Christ, and  for a Communist country who believes that religion is the heroin to the  folks, they stayed amidst the tough sanctions they lived under.  I looked out the window early morning, and I saw somebody on a  Moped pull up to another Moped, look around, didn   t see anybody, and  he pulled the pedals off that first moped and put it on his. (Laughs) I was  amazed. I was amazed at the lack of selections of goods in stores,  amazed at the lack of produce in the veggie stores because we were so  used to having everything. The moment you crossed into East Germany,  it turned gray. There were no colors. There were truly no colors.  Anything East Germany produced that had any worth was sold and sent  out of the country. What was left was really not much. Now, food was  inexpensive to us from East Germany. When you went to East Germany,  you had to convert German Marks to East German money, which in the  real world wasn   t worth anything. But in order to go into East Germany,  you had to convert   I don   t recall how much, but they would literally do  one-to-one, you know, the exchange rate.  Things in East Germany that we purchased were musical notes,  handmade instruments, things of that nature, porcelain, because other  than that, of course, they did not have much. We got accosted on the  streets, if we would consider selling our jeans. People could tell by what  we wore that we were West Germans, not East Germans. It was quite an  eye opener, even though we   ve always been surrounded by them. We  always sent foods, coffee, oranges, toilet paper, things that at times they  were out of. The time we were in East Germany for a week, they were  out of toilet paper, so various places there were cut-up newspapers hung  on a big hook. Ta-da  (Laughter)  Were you just visiting with your father?  With the partner churches, yes. We as a whole family went and stayed,  14  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  literally, a week in East Germany. Stayed, I don   t recall, three or four  days in Magdeburg, saw all the historical things there. Then to the other  partner church in Crimmitschau. It was quite an eye-opening.  Did you feel like you wanted to do more after that trip, or did you feel  more blessed to be living in the west?  I suppose I was quite astounded by the fact that those who the regime  would let leave, (believing Christians, ministers, people who wanted to  make a change within their Communist country based upon their faith)  those who could actually leave chose to stay to make their difference.  That   s probably what I took back with me the most. Regardless of what,  their faith was stronger than the things the government laid upon them to  overcome.  So what were the schools you attended?  Oh, goodness. (Laughter) Let   s see. I went to a home economics school  for a year. I went to a private medical school for a year. Two years to  schooling for psychology, pedagogik, and sociology. Any class,  anything I could take in between, I took just because. (Laughs)  Did you work after that?  No. I fell in love while I was in college, and that   s kind of how I got  here. In my previous lifetime with my first husband, we got orders to  Fort Hood, Texas. He actually got taken back, but then second orders  came that said,    You have to be there now.    We had less than two  weeks. I literally flew in my ninth month to the United States. According  to my German gynecologist, that was just fine. Some airplanes  nowadays are just fine. Plus, I really did not show. I landed in Killeen,  Texas, to a hundred-and-some-odd-degree heat, learning real quick you  can sweat in places you did not know exist. (Laughter)  So had you gotten married in Germany?  No, actually I got married in the US.  Okay. Did you have a wedding?  Yes. Yes, in a Lutheran church. (Laughs)  Was his family living in Killeen?  No. My previous in-laws, who I adored greatly, were from Kentucky. I  had the pleasure of getting to know about their history because they  15  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  came from what   s called Clay County, one of oldest and most depressed  in regards to economics in the state of Kentucky. My former father-in-law  was drafted, was in World War II, got hurt not once but twice out in  the Pacific. After World War II, he used his GI Bill, despite the fact that  he had children and a wife, and went to college, and he became a civil  servant for the state of Kentucky. I had the pleasure of getting to know a  part of the country in its history and its oddities and its fineties.  The first meal in that family, (I will never forget) wonderful, big spread  of awesome looking food, good smells, but I needed to know what each  item was before I   d eat it. One of them, they tried to explain, and it just  wouldn   t work. Finally, my ex-husband says,    You know when we went  to the park in Germany and you fed them, you know, those?    I said,     Oh, my God  You eat eichh  rnchen?    which are squirrels. They are,  under nature, safety cautious things in Germany because they are kind of  extinct. They are wonderful, big, brown, bushy tails, and here I   m being  told,    You   re fixing to eat a squirrel.    I smiled, and I politely refused.  (Laughter) Different countries, different eatings.  Although, not everyone in the United States eats squirrels. (Laughter)  That   s very true, very true. Just like our rattlesnake derby coming up in  Mangum. Rattlesnake is not necessarily my thing, either. (Laughter)  So were you welcomed into Killeen, Texas, by anyone? Did he know  people there?  No, no, just the largest military base in the free world. That   s what Fort  Hood   back in the day there was 55,000 GIs, plus dependents, plus civil  servants, plus. Learning American or about America was quite  challenging at times. TV helped. Neighbors helped a lot, but overall it  was literally learning one day at a time. Some things I just couldn   t  figure out, so I   ve always just asked, as odd the questions might be, but  they mattered to me. I   ve always just asked. I   ve held various positions,  various titles over the years, and the one thing I   ve always done is just  asked,    How come?    Whether I   ve gone to classes, Zig Ziglar, or this or  that, things are all very the same yet different, but when it comes to  interpersonal things, I always question because there is so much new  here. Many things I do not know nothing about.  Back, my first real job, Little John and Big John were people that  worked at a furniture store. One was black, and one wasn   t. Well, I don   t  know anything about different cultures, so I would ask. We   d sit there     the last hour was just him and I at the end of day. I would ask such  questions as,    John, do you get sunburned?    He goes,    Of course, I get  sunburned.    I said,    Okay. John, do y   all go to the beach to tan?    He  16  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  gave me this look of,    You   ve got to be kidding.    Well, how would I  know unless I asked, because now we   re talking of something I did not  know anything about. Human nature to me is something so most  fascinating that I like to have exchanges in learning about them, what  makes them tick, what makes them different.  So you learned a lot about the culture through asking?  Very much. Oh, yes. Absorbing.  Much more than   some people are afraid to ask. That really paid off.  Well, I did not know any other way than to ask. This was before internet,  before cell phones. I   ve always just asked no matter what it is, whether  it   s business or not, how they derive or    how come?   .    How come?    is  probably a good one I use a lot.  So what year did you come to the United States?  Nineteen eighty-three.  Besides the hot temperatures, what was your biggest moment of culture  shock when you first arrived?  To realize American department stores do not have grocery stores in the  basement. We went to a K-Mart, and when we were done shopping, I  said,    Let   s do groceries. Where does it go downstairs?    (Laughter)  They all looked funny at me. Growing up, our department stores had  grocery stores in the bottom. That was probably the biggest. (Laughter)  I guess in the early    80s, Wal-Marts weren   t quite as prevalent, so     Not in that part, but they were. They were also very unusual. Everything  in Texas was unusual. The national pride displayed by Texans, and  combine that with   back in the    80s, every Wal-Mart had the big signs,     Proudly made in the USA,       Proud to be an American.    This type of  nationalism was such an uncommon thing that it felt slightly  uncomfortable because, again, the country from which I come didn   t  have a whole lot of national pride when we were born and raised due to  the issues of World War II. To then come to the exact opposite, to a state  that does nothing finer than show their red, white, and blue for any  occasions   .  Texans are a breed of their own. There is nothing finer than Texas pride,  I have to say. That   s what I literally felt I got dropped into. After a  while, you learned about that and that people truly are as nice when they  17  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  say,    Hi, how are you,    not just making small talk, and I made it mine.  Add to that a military community, to that, different deployments,  whether it was Kuwait the first time or second time, troops being pulled  out. I   ve learned a lot about America, and I have learned that they come  together no matter what. However much divided they are, for whatever  purposes or religion or politics, when things happen they do pull  together.  How did you communicate with your family that was in Germany when  you first got here?  By letters. We could not afford a phone, let alone call Germany, so  letters by airmail it was.  Have you kept any of those letters?  I might have a couple, but because we lost the house   very pivotal.  Today three years ago, the wildfires consumed my husband   s homestead  in Choctaw, and unfortunately a lot of those things to include my kids     childhood, all their things I saved, they   re all gone. So, no.  But you were able to write letters back and forth and stay in touch that  way.  Oh, yes. Yes, and it was busy. When you are young with a baby and  poor, (and we were poor) life just runs past you. I mean, it took  everything just to stay on top of your daily life. When we didn   t have  enough money to go to the laundromat, I washed them by hand. The  thing is, we came from Germany where we lived well because I had  income. Then we came here, and it was rough. I learned what a pawn  shop is for. I   ve learned four-for-a-dollar and coupons. (Laughter)  So how long did you live at Fort Hood?  I left the Killeen-Copperas Cove area in 1997 after I married my second  husband, my Ray.  How did you meet him?  Oh, well, there are two sides to this story. I have mine, and he has his.  (Laughter) I was out on a date when I noticed this man. No, the date was  just a date. That   s how I met my Ray, who was also military, but I did  not know. Anyway, we got married in    97, and he was fixing to, in the  process of   I   m using the Texas verb    fixing to.    I earned it. (Laughter)  He was retiring in    98 and already owned a home inland, east of  Oklahoma City, because his family homesteaded in Choctaw in 1908. So  18  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  to allow my son   s ninth grade to start in Oklahoma, I already moved up  here to Oklahoma.  Had you visited Oklahoma while you were living in Texas?  Yes.  Had you ever had any reason to?  No, just driven through on the interstate as such. Did not know a whole  lot about Oklahoma. I know a lot more now. (Laughs) I think I got  taught well by Texans in regards of Southernness. Oklahoma, as a  whole, is an awesome state. There are areas that people are not aware of  how very pretty they are. People outside Oklahoma seem to think it is  flat and looks like the Dust Bowl. Well, I am here to say it does not. It  can, but there are beautiful areas in the state of Oklahoma that if you  choose to see, you can find them.  And one of them, you have an excellent view from your porch here.  I sure do. (Laughs) I do.  Will you describe your view here?  I can look out my back deck and see to the right the southwest plateau  starting from the southwest, and on the left, I can see the Granite  Mountains, the Quartz Mountains, actually. That can be stunning. I can  live in my head, and in the wintertime I can pretend that it   s the Alps, or  I can be anywhere because those little mountaintops will be white. It  reminds me of places that I   ve always wanted to go, if I can ignore the  everlasting 110 degrees in the summer.  That   s hard to ignore. (Laughter)  Yes  Yes. My rule is, I can always put clothes on, but you can only take  so much off. (Laughs) When it   s hot, it   s hot, and to have good relations  with your air conditioning men. Without that, you cannot function.  When did you move to Mangum?  We decided to move to Mangum around 2006, but we physically moved  November of    08. We got charmed by this most wonderful small town  and fell in love with its people. There are, as we refer to them, shiny,  wonderful people in this town that all in their own rights are trying to do  their own thing to make a difference. I have been privileged enough to  have met one of the first lady lawyers in this state, who just passed  19  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  away. This town was progressive enough to have most everybody, when  we moved here, were females, mayor, city manager, etcetera, etcetera.  So for southwestern Oklahoma, that appeared to be quite progressive.  And you were first acquainted with this town through your work?  Yes. Professionally, I   ve been taking care of dental practices in three  states. Mangum, Oklahoma, has two dentists who in the past I have had  both of my clients. There came a time where I did a long stint of thirteen  weeks, back to back, and I would stay at the bed and breakfast and then  work with the employees in Dr.  Dustin  Lively   s practice. After thirteen  weeks, I learned who was where and what they did and some cute things  such as a heifer is not just an unpleasant woman that calls. It   s a true  form of livestock. (Laughter) I learned that people talked different, and I  learned that when you sit in a restaurant by yourself, that when  somebody goes,    So who are you kin to?    they mean me. They wanted  to know who I was here to see. Once I explained that I was here on  business to see a certain doctor or what have you, that   s all that it took.  This town is big on their alumnis. They call themselves Tigers. At first, I  always heard how unless you   re a Tiger, you   re not going to make it in  Mangum. I always thought,    Well, that   s too bad. I   m not a Tiger, but  I   ve been a Bulldog Mom. I   ve been a Yellow Jacket Mom. Wherever  my kids have gone, I   ve supported that school. Just because I   m not a  Tiger, i.e. Mangum Tigers, seemingly, I was told,    You   re not going to  get around much in this town.    Well, I choose to show them different. I  may not have been a Tiger, but I got here as fast as I could, and I can  make my difference in this town, as well.  And you have been.  Yes, I   m trying on it.  You   re quite involved in the community.  Yes, yes. Be part of the change you want to see. All these groups are  dying out. We have a large senior population. A lot of the younger ones,  I guess, move away. Now all the sixties ones are moving back and  bringing a little bit of pep back into the community. So even though  some of the old-timers may still phrase,    Unless you were born here or  you   re a Tiger,    or what have you, most of the new and energetic plug  that has come into this community are actually those who have moved  here. I started this little campaign called    Mangum by Choice    because  we   re all here because we choose to be, to make a difference. Everyone  can make a difference.  20  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  And you   ve made stickers?  Yes. I created, I designed, and had bumper stickers made that hang in  most of the restaurants and businesses on their doors. We   ve also, my  husband, my Ray and I, started Founders of the American Legion  Riders, motorcyclists that fall under the American Legion, and we   re  involved in the Fourth of July celebration. We   re involved in the  Veterans Day and Memorial Day services. Oh, and Women   s Civic  Club. Yes, I   m involved in them. Again, whether I was born here or not,  I can make my difference in teaching the basics of things that I was  taught: integrity, honesty, involvement, and to be socially active because  it matters. I sound like such a goody two shoe, but I   m such a good  biker. (Laughter) Oh, yes, and I infiltrate everybody with Apfelkorn.  With what?  Apple corn.  Oh, awesome. (Laughs)  See, I don   t drink beer.  That   s scary, though. (Laughter)  No  You now can buy it in every liquor store in this area.  You can?  Everywhere I go, they carry now Apfelkorn.  Because of you?  Because I infect   I call it    I infect people with it.    It   s a girly drink, and  I created a group called Women of the Korn. I have patches. They are  now in Europe and everywhere. The bikers wear them. Then I created  this with men because a good man is hard to find that can pour twenty  women a shot at the same time, so now we have man servants.  (Laughter) The biggest, baddest bikers in this state, if you look on their  vests, have a lime green thing that says    Man Servant.    It   s in honor of  us. I   m Queen of Korn, (Laughter) or as somebody said,    You   re queen  of porn?    I   m like,    No, no, no. It   s korn. K not P.    (Laughter) I just  think different. Most people will think,    Why?    I think more,    Why  not?    Then if it matters enough, I   ll find a way.  That   s wonderful. What are some of the things that the Women   s Civic  Club of Mangum have done?  21  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Oh, the Women   s Civic Club  Let   s see. I think average age was about  seventy when I met another wonderful lady, Ms. Margaret Carder. She   s  the lady after whom the library is named. She was a mayor, founder of  the Women   s Civic Club. By the time I met her, little bitty, slightly frail  lady, but she had spunk, and she shined. She said,    Oh, Ilka, you should  come,    so I went, and within three months they had elections. I wasn   t  paying attention. I was writing or doing something, and I hear my name  being called as president for the next thing. I went,    What?     (Laughter)  That   s how I became the first term president. By now, I guess I   ll be  fourth term.  We have started the Fourth of July celebration. We picked it up and then  with the American Legion Riders hosting Mangum   s Fourth of July, as  well as we have celebrated for the second year in a row women pastors,  wives or spouses because there might be males. We host them and just  tell them thank you for everything they do within the community. I  played in a theater play to help for the Juvenile Diabetes  Research   Foundation and to educate about bikers, and I   ve been state rep for a  motorcycle rights organization in the state. I do what I can.  And then you give speeches.  I do. I do.  Tell us what your speeches are often about.  Well, I give presentations to any and all groups that may want to have  me, whether it is elementary schools, high schools, (it does not matter)  about Germanism, I suppose would be a good word. Whether it is  Christmas, and I take a German Advent calendar filled with little  chocolates and go speak to all the elementary classes about German  Christmas, German customs, what do we eat. Or for citizenship, I went  and educated elementary school and high school about what does it take  to become a citizen, from the legalities to the actualities to do. As well  as you can think of it, I   ll come and speak. I   ll read a German book  during international library day or patriotism or what have you.  It is up to people, all people, to teach the next generation. I   ve been here  long enough to see this country go from one to the other side, and I see  things decline. I, for my part, don   t want to wake up in twenty years and  think,    could have, would have, should have.    It is a need of mine to  step up and speak out despite my fears of doing it publicly because  you   re letting yourself wide open when you do that. It is my  responsibility as a citizen as well as a Christian to make my difference  while I can. If I have the gift to actually go out to do, and the  22  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  opportunities, then I   m going to do that to help people shine.  So you   ve probably taught a lot of people about German culture and  helped them understand a little bit more.  Yes. One of the cutest things is for children that have never been  exposed to another culture or another life, per se, or might   ve never  traveled outside their little town. It seems a little hard to comprehend  that there is children on the other side of the world that are just as  children as they are but grow up slightly different. I may bring a game  along. I may bring a German song or sing them a German song that is  identical to the one in English, just in a different language. Christmas  songs are very easy because many of them are German origins as such. I  find children are so very easily fascinated by just the basics of teaching  them that there is children everywhere who love their parents and their  parents love them. It   s just all slightly different. Yes, it   s like stepping  back into time.  What are some things you miss about Germany? Cultural     Oh, let   s see. Everything has pros and cons. One of the things I probably  miss the most is walking. Not just do you take public transportation to  go downtown because it   s so much easier to catch that bus that runs  every ten minutes than it is to find a parking spot for your car, let alone  to pay for parking. So despite my rental car, I take the bus. I go  shopping; I carry my bags and what have you. Not just have I not gained  weight while I   m in Germany, but I eat coffee and cake every afternoon.  (Laughs) You   re slightly more active because life there is different. You  do not have fridges our size. They   re still slightly smaller. People go  shopping more often for fresh foods. I miss that.  I miss the socialization of downtowns, where on a Saturday you may  have a musician play here and a band over there. Socializing is still more  in public there versus here, maybe because of the heat. When it   s hot,  we   re all just homebound, I guess. It   s hot. (Laughter)  I miss culture since I grew up with going to the theater and what have  you, but we do have some things in our area such as the Philharmonic in  Lawton, such as the Oklahoma Arts Institute that comes yearly out here.  We as the community host a cookie gathering and get to see all their  performances free at no charge of the best and brightest of Oklahoma   s  youth, which is very fascinating, too. Everything else, I can touch. With  internet, I can order anything, read anything. If I really want it bad  enough, I can find it. Of course, it   ll cost more, but that   s the price of  wanting something, is how I look upon it.  23  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  When I arrived here thirty years ago, going on thirty years ago, I was  lucky to find Nivea in an import store. Now Nivea is a common brand.  Haribo, my favorite gummy bears, I can buy the three-pound bag at  Wal-Mart. America, as such, or the America that I live in, has become  much more open minded and a bit more open to different influences of  the world in today   s market. I can find Greek cheese, Greek yogurt. I  can find the Hothouse cucumbers, which is what we grew up with, the  long cucumbers that are burpless and seedless and do not need to be  peeled. I can find them at Wal-Mart. So, again, because of the  globalization of life and technology of today, life is so much easier as a  former foreigner. Of course, now I   m not a foreigner anymore. I   m an  American, but I can find my foreign foods very easy.  And for a little while, you lived in Choctaw.  Oh, yes. Actually, yes, from    97 until    08.  Okay, so eleven years?  Yes. East of the City is what we call it, which brings me to another one.  Everything is pertaining to whatever state one lives in. It took me a  while to figure out that in this state of Oklahoma, when people refer to,     I   m going to the City,    I go,    Which one,    depending upon where I  was. Was it Stillwater, Tulsa, Lawton, Wichita Falls, Texas? Oh, no. In  the state of Oklahoma, when one refers to,    I   m going to the City,    it   s  only Oklahoma City. All other cities will be spelled out. (Laughter)  Those are specific things to Oklahoma. I   ve never heard of a card-carrying  Indian before I worked for three months in a medical clinic.  Every state has its own issues, its own things to overcome. It tickles me  slightly to have my ID card or my driver   s license that says,    Native.     (Laughter) I   m not quite native, but I   m an Okie by now. (Laughter)  Well, how does it feel to be an Oklahoman?  Well, overcoming stereotypes would come to mind. When people hear  you   re coming from Oklahoma or you are from Oklahoma, they have  this preconceived notion. I   m doing everything I can to overcome that  because, unfortunately, prejudisms are still out there everywhere. It  don   t matter what state, what country. Oklahomans as a whole in the  United States, people still seemingly think it   s the Dust Bowl. It is not.  Oklahoma is pretty progressive. The Riverwalk in the City has oomphed  it up. There is art. There are things one can go see. You just have to  learn where they   re at. Tulsa is an awesome town. I love the vibe within  Tulsa. Oklahoma City is slightly different, but Oklahoma has something  for everybody.  24  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Could you tell us a little bit about the rattlesnake festival in Mangum?  (Laughs) All right. Ilka lives slightly outside Mangum, Oklahoma,  which is known for the rattlesnake derby. No, rattlesnakes do not roll  around or slither through downtown. No, I have not had a rattlesnake in  my house or on my porch, and no, I   ve never really seen one except at  the rattlesnake derby. It was an attempt, I want to say, in the    30s,  maybe, by the community of trying to come up with an event that would  draw people, and what was it that they had? Lots of snakes.  So the last weekend in April is the annual rattlesnake derby. What that  translates to is tens of thousands of people coming into this little bitty  community of three thousand to observe, share, taste, touch, smell,  whatever floats your boat, in regards to rattlesnakes. People actually go  out into the wild, catch them, and there is a big, big tent in which they all  go into after they   re measured. Handlers are on the inside, and you can  go check them out. There is a rattlesnake caf   in which you may taste  fried, cooked, whatever, snake, rattlesnake. You get to take your picture  with the biggest rattlesnake you can imagine, if you so choose. I have  known a couple of the past rattlesnake derby princesses. It even made it  into the German version of the Sports Illustrated about Mangum,  Oklahoma   s rattlesnake derby. (Laughter)  Did you have anything to do with that?  No, that was before my time, but the first response from my friends in  the international community is,    Oh, my. Do they pick them back up and  put them out in the wild?    I go,    You know, they don   t slither. They get  caught.    Everybody goes and tries and catches as many, and then they  get measured and weighed, thrown into that smelly (I call it smelly)  thing, and a big carnival, big flea market. It brings Mangum   s revenues  up. Some businesses make during the rattlesnake derby enough to hold  them open for a year, so it   s, again, a vital thing for this community to  support. Even so, those of us who live here might close our gates a little  better because one never knows who else comes to town, but it   s a great  cause, and it   s a great thing for people to come and check out  rattlesnakes.  Wow. I   ve never been, but it does sound exciting. (Laughs)  Well, if you want to come, please come on  We   re hosting our first  rattlesnake derby motorcycle run as a fundraiser for the rattlesnake  association and the American Legion Riders. Motorcyclists love going  on runs, and why not have one for the rattlesnake derby? Collect five,  ten dollars per head and use that money, again, within the community  wherever it   s needed.  25  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  Wilson  Heiskell  That   s great. Well, is there anything that we have not covered?  I love this place. (Laughs) I love this place. Despite the fact that there  are days I do not understand people because I just grew up so very  different, politically, religiously, what have you, I love it, and I   m part of  it, and I   m making it mine.  Well, we sure appreciate your efforts to make Oklahoma better as a  native Oklahoman. I think you   re showing a lot of native Oklahomans  out here up     Well, yes, well        by your community participation and hopefully serving as a role  model and mentor for other people to step it up and make a difference.  I appreciate you saying this. I just cannot help but do it. I just have  different passions here and there that require somebody to step up and  do something. That   s what I do.  Well, it   s wonderful.  Thank you. Thank you.  -------  -------
