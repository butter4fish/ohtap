WENDY TAPIA:  All right.  So we&#8217;re here with Miss Bessie Elmore.  Interviewers Wendy Tapia and   NICK SHIELDS:  Nick Shields.    WT:  Nick Shields.  WT:  Today is Friday June 1st , 2012 and we are at a woman&#8217;s shelter, an undisclosed location, and we will be talking with Miss Bessie about her role in the women&#8217;s movement.  So Miss Bessie, tell us a little bit about yourself.  BESSIE ELMORE:  I was born in Macon County, Alabama, July 14th, 1948, which was so they tell me a very hot day.  My parents moved to New Jersey when I was three years old.  I grew up in between Morristown, New Jersey and East Orange, New Jersey.  I went to school there.  My parents, my father worked for a company called (      ) Manufacturing that made vending machines, cigarettes, soda.  He was a welder.  My mother was a stay at home mom.  My parents owned a house in East Orange, and I had three, they had seven children and I am the oldest.  I got married.  I have two children.  And after I got married I moved to Irvington, New Jersey.  We were there for a very long time before we moved to Stone Mountain, Georgia.    I want, I don&#8217;t want to say well, I guess I do want to say my marriage was abusive.  It started out as physical and then later on turned to mental.  I stayed in that marriage for a very long time because I grew up in a two-parent household, and I wanted  my children to have the same things I had.  I grew up in a house.  I wanted my children to grow up in a house.  I grew up in a nice neighborhood.  I wanted my children to grow up in a nice neighborhood.  No one in my family had been divorced, and I didn&#8217;t want to be the first one to get divorced.  I was the oldest granddaughter, the oldest niece and it just seemed to be, I didn&#8217;t want to be the one that broke whatever my ideals were of what a family is supposed to be like.  So excuse me, and at that time there was I won&#8217;t say, I wanted my son to have his father especially having a male figure.  And I wanted my daughter to have a male figure.  So I just stayed in the marriage.  Later moved to Stone Mountain, Georgia thinking that things would change.  Things don&#8217;t change unless people change, change their behavior and that did not happen.  Some other things were going on.    But I managed to save up three hundred dollars and this is really kind of ironic because nineteen years ago during this time I came to Durham, North Carolina thinking that I would just come here and get a job and have a good life.  It didn&#8217;t really turn out that way because three hundred dollars is not a lot of money.  But I figured I had skills.  My educational background was in accounting.  So I figured I could get a job.  It didn&#8217;t work out that way.  One, I was new to the area, didn&#8217;t know anybody here.  Two, age played a big role in my finding a job and a lot of other things.  I really didn&#8217;t have a history here.  So I ended up staying at this place called Temporary Quarters, which was a haven for transient people, substance abusers, alcoholic, you name it, prostitution.  They all lived there.  And my money was really starting to run out, and I didn&#8217;t want to go back to Georgia.  I didn&#8217;t want to call any of my family to let them know where I was because I was embarrassed, ashamed and all of that stuff.  My parents had already passed away.  Both of my parents had passed away.  My dad had cancer, and two years later my mom passed away.  So I didn&#8217;t have my parents and I didn&#8217;t want to call on my uncles or my aunt for help.  So I figured okay, I&#8217;m going to work this out on my own.  But it wasn&#8217;t working out.    Anyway, I was downtown at the post office, downtown Durham at the post office, and there was a sign up on the wall by the phone booth there that said it talked about domestic violence and had a phone number.  And I called.  And I was able to talk to someone on the crisis line, and I told them my story.  And I only had a quarter left anyway.  At the time phone calls were still twenty-five cents.  And I made that phone call and one of the young ladies that worked here at this shelter came and got me and went to the hotel where I was, Temporary Quarters and got my little luggage.  I didn&#8217;t have a lot of stuff anyway and brought me to this shelter.    I&#8217;m going back in my mind as I talk about it because this particular room were&#8217; in is something totally different.  Anyway brought me to the shelter and I think I was really numb because when you come in a shelter.  First of all you have no idea what you&#8217;re coming to.  Then you have no idea what you&#8217;re going to find when you get here.  And at that particular time the rooms were pretty much full, four rooms.  And in each room there was a set of bunk beds, and the rooms were pretty much full.  So for the room I went in there was just one bed available, and it just happened that I got that bed.  But it was very interesting because I had to get on the top bunk, and I've never slept in a bunk bed, and I had never been in a place where there was community living.  So it was kind of, I can&#8217;t even explain the feeling that when a person, woman comes into a shelter.  It&#8217;s not shock.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s shock.  I don&#8217;t know what it is.  I can&#8217;t put a name to it right now.  But you&#8217;re in, I don&#8217;t know.  I can&#8217;t put a name to it.    But anyway, I was told the room I would go in and my bed and I was given, well, I already had towels so I didn&#8217;t need that.  But they gave me soap and toothpaste and they showed me around the kitchen, the food pantry, because I didn&#8217;t have any money.  So I would have to find some food in the food pantry to eat, and we had two refrigerators and they showed me my cabinet that I could put my food in, I would have to label it, put my name on all of my food.  We were all sharing different bathrooms and upstairs where we slept so I would be sharing.  And that&#8217;s a kind of a weird feeling too because you don&#8217;t know the people.  The only thing you have in common with people in the shelter is that you&#8217;re here for the same reason.  And you kind of like have to get to know one another which we did later on.  The women talk and share their stories.  I met the rest of the staff, and they told me Monday nights what we do on Monday nights.  What we do support group and all of that.    But it&#8217;s still a numb feeling because you&#8217;re like in the twilight zone.  That&#8217;s the best word I can find out, find.  You&#8217;re like in a twilight zone and you&#8217;re length of stay.  You have a lot of paperwork you have to go through.  You have to do your intake and paperwork you have to sign, and they give you the handbook and tell you the rules.  You have chores, the time you have to be in, curfew.  And the length of stay, I think when I was here the length of stay was just four weeks.  And during that four week time there&#8217;s certain things you have to do.  But what I've found with that length of stay, that first week you&#8217;re just totally confused.  So with me thinking that week shouldn&#8217;t even be counted because you&#8217;ve got to figure out what you&#8217;re going to do.  You&#8217;ve got to figure out do you want to stay here; do you want to go back.  You&#8217;re like this.  You go back and forth, back and forth because you&#8217;re living in a place again that&#8217;s community living.  You&#8217;re using bathroom, you&#8217;re in the kitchen.  Everything is with people you don&#8217;t know.  And sometimes some of the people come with different issues outside of domestic violence whether it&#8217;s alcohol or drugs, stealing from you.  So you really don&#8217;t know the people you&#8217;re in here with.  You would hope that wouldn&#8217;t happen but it&#8217;s possible.  But then you have to go sign up for different services.  You&#8217;ve got to know about the bus, and it was just difficult, very difficult.  And as things progressed with me I was determined I wasn&#8217;t going to go back so I suppose I didn&#8217;t have a choice.    But I didn&#8217;t identify with anybody, any of the people in the shelter, any of the women in the shelter because I thought that I&#8217;m an educated woman.  I&#8217;m older.  I don&#8217;t identify with any of these women.  But after a while it starts to settle in that forget about your educational background.  Forget about your once upon a time financial situation.  Domestic violence is domestic violence so it doesn&#8217;t matter about race or doesn&#8217;t care about how much money you have or you don&#8217;t have.  Doesn&#8217;t matter what kind of house you used to live in.  The fact is you&#8217;re here at the shelter because you&#8217;re a victim of domestic violence.  So once that kind of set in I was like, okay.  All right.  I&#8217;m no better than any of the other ladies here.    And as things went on I was able to get a job.  I came back here to work the weekend, and I started taking classes on human behavior and personal growth and development and had the opportunity to start working here at the shelter.  And I took that opportunity because I had so much to give back.  I had learned so much and I had so much to give back, and I could identify with the women when they would come here.  I would identify with the women when they would come here.  I understood some of the things they were feeling about chores, about community living, about like I don&#8217;t belong here.  I&#8217;m better than and letting them know that no you&#8217;re not.  It&#8217;s a rewarding feeling, but I also had to learn how to set healthy boundaries because you can become so polluted with hearing all the stories that two things can happen to you.  You can become so hard on yourself because you say why couldn&#8217;t you see that.  Well, why, why, why, why.  Or you can be so empathetic, oh empathetic, sympathetic that you lose all of your own perspective on how you&#8217;re going to help that individual.  So it&#8217;s learning how to create a healthy balance and knowing when to step back.  And sometimes that&#8217;s really, really hard to really try to figure that out and knowing all along that you&#8217;re not a psychiatrist.  You&#8217;re not a therapist so you don&#8217;t have the cure all because women are going to go back no matter what you say.  It&#8217;s their mindset.  They have to make up in their mind that this is it.  I don&#8217;t want to go back.  I don&#8217;t want to live this way anymore.  But you ask a counselor or whomever, you can&#8217;t make that choice for that person.  That person has to make that choice for themselves.  And here I am, still here.  WT:  How do you feel the community&#8217;s perception against in regards to violence against women has evolved since you first became part of DCRC?  BE:  Oh wow.  I still don&#8217;t think that people really get a handle on domestic violence.  No matter how much it&#8217;s talked about and over the years I could almost see very little change because people still want to put blinders on when it comes to violence against women.  I think society says well, she had to do something to cause that.  And I think that it&#8217;s a man&#8217;s world, and I don&#8217;t think that society looks at domestic violence as a sickness that yes, it does happen.  And accepts the fact that it&#8217;s still going on.  WT:  So going back to your, like your family background, in regards to your grandparents and your parents, what kind of, what kind of standards did they have for you as a woman?  Like what did they teach you that a woman&#8217;s role was?  BE:  Oh well, my father I think with my dad growing up he always said that girls needed a good education but boys needed a better education and a trade because eventually the female would get married and her husband would take care of her.  But I was always this independent thinker and I wanted to get married and I also wanted to have a career.  So my father, both my parents supported that.  So even with my grandfather, he supported that.  I won&#8217;t say that, it wasn&#8217;t where my dad said you know a woman&#8217;s place is in the home.  My mom and my dad chose for my mom to be a stay at home mom.  He went out, he worked.  But as quiet as it&#8217;s kept, my mom really was ran the house.  She took care of everything.  My dad just went out and made the money.    NS:  My only question is when we talked about the past a lot and the present, what are your goals as far as like for this establish right here for the future?  Like what would you like to see change that coincides with the women&#8217;s movement right now?  BE:  Well, one of the things amongst quite a few things that I would like to see changed the length of stay because we have so many women waiting to get in the shelter.  The length of stay like I said when I came that first week you&#8217;ve got to figure out what you want to do, finding an apartment is not easy especially if you don&#8217;t have a job and if you have children.  It&#8217;s just trying to make sense of the chaotic situation you came out of, just trying to make sense of okay, having someone to help you plan out your next step.  So I think when women come here, they need a lot of support, but the financial piece is not there to help with that situation.  So often times women go back because they don&#8217;t feel like they have any other choice.  So I think the big thing would be the financial piece.  NS:  Right.  Just helping people get back on their feet.  As far as like education goes, what do you tell people that come in here?  BE:  As far as getting an education?  NS:  No, like I mean as far as sexual violence and&#8212;  BE:  Oh we offer classes on sexual assault, all different kind of classes we offer like self-esteem and we have this curriculum but that doesn&#8217;t happen in a four-week.  If you&#8217;ve been in an abusive relationship for ten years, four or five weeks that&#8217;s not going to boost your self-esteem in four or five weeks.  That&#8217;s going to take some time to do that.  We do offer or we do have continued support groups afterwards, but everything is a process.  It&#8217;s not just going to happen overnight.  WT:  So I see that you were born in 1948 in Alabama.  BE:  Yes.  WT:  Can you tell me what it was like to grow up in Alabama in&#8212;  BE:  I didn&#8217;t.  I was only there until I was three.    WT:  Did you, where else did you move?  BE:  To New Jersey.  WT:  New Jersey.  What was it like growing up in New Jersey in the [19]50s?  BE:  Oh it was really, it was I had a very good life growing up.  The [19]60s were great.  What do they call it, the hippie years, I really didn&#8217;t do a lot of things, experience a lot of things that other people did with booze and drugs and stuff like that.  But I enjoyed a lot of my teenage years, spent a lot in New York and in the Village, and I had a good life.  I can&#8217;t say anything really bad about my growing up.  I had a good life.    WT:  Um what about civil rights movements during that time?  Did you take part in any of those?  BE:  As a matter of fact I did.  My grandfather ran for road commissioner in Alabama, and I went down to do voter registration for him.  It was very interesting growing up at that time because we lived in New Jersey, and every summer we would vacation in Alabama and driving from New Jersey to Alabama coming through some of the towns and when we would stop at the gas stations and we would see the sign that said colored only.  And that was interesting but my father was so adamant about our not paying attention.  Don&#8217;t pay any attention to that colored only water fountain or door if we&#8217;re going into a restaurant.  He never, we always went in the door that everybody else was, the colored only.  It was kind of confusing.  Why is that up there?  So I mean he explained things to us about what was going on.  But I find that so funny now because I&#8217;m living in Durham and when we would drive through here, my dad would tell us about what was going on in Durham with the cigarette Lucky Strikes and all these Chesterfield signs where this is where the cigarettes were made.  But he never the colored only signs or the drinking fountains, we never drank from a colored only fountain.    Involved in the civil rights movement.  My dad was very active in that.  Like I said when I helped my grandfather on his campaign and going to people&#8217;s doors.  I didn&#8217;t realize there were so many black people who were afraid to register to vote.  And at that time I didn&#8217;t understand why.  Why?  But there was a big difference in living in New Jersey and then coming to the South.  A lot of the things, and I&#8217;m sure it was going on in New Jersey, we just didn&#8217;t know about it.  I went to school with Caucasians in my class, maybe there were only a couple of blacks but it didn&#8217;t make any difference.  But when we would come to Alabama, the schools were all black kids.  So that was kind of strange to me.  But it didn&#8217;t really have that much of an impact because I knew I was going back to Jersey.  So these little poor kids here didn&#8217;t when I would see them in the summer and they wouldn&#8217;t have their shoes on, I tried to walk barefoot but I couldn&#8217;t do it.  So my cousins my age tell me now that I was a privileged child.  And I was like I don&#8217;t think so.  But I suppose compared to, because they had to pick cotton in the summer and all that stuff, and I don&#8217;t know anything about picking cotton.  It was just, just so different.  But I always knew in two weeks I&#8217;m going to be going back home and we got street lights.  I&#8217;m not going to be in the country.  I&#8217;ve got a TV, all those things where they didn&#8217;t have.    WT:   Can you tell me more about your college experience?  BE:  Like what?  WT:  Well, like where did you go to college?  BE:  At first I went to school, I entered this nursing program because I thought I wanted to be a nurse.  And after about a year in the program, I didn&#8217;t want to be a nurse.  So my father suggested that I do accounting and Thomas Edison, and it still exists.  It&#8217;s in Trenton New Jersey but you don&#8217;t go to the school.  It&#8217;s much like University of Phoenix now.  They&#8217;re doing everything online.  Well, it was almost like that of course but you didn&#8217;t have computers.  I went to Thomas Edison and then I went to Rutgers, and then I took some courses at Seton Hall.  And I didn&#8217;t start doing the University of Phoenix until and that was maybe like five years ago I started--.  I wanted to change my major into human services.    WT:  So what were your experiences like as an African American woman in college?  Do you feel that race had any impact on your experience?  BE:  Yes, because there were certain times where I felt like I was going to be this little militant person with the Afro and the Afro-centric clothing.  My father had always been very, very outspoken when it came to race issues.  He always let us know that we were no different than Caucasians.  We could do and be whatever we wanted to do or be, and we should not let anyone define us by the color of our skin.  My father was very, very dark.  My mom was a lighter complexion.  And my father was this huge man and his presence, he always stood out.  But he always let us know to treat people fairly and to be honest in everything we did.  I grew up in the time of they had the Newark riots.  We lived in East Orange but Newark was, I&#8217;m going to say where the riots took place was probably about five miles from where we were from the East Orange line.  I knew what was going on then, and I understood some of the things that was going on.  But I was not involved in any marches or protests.  One of the things I did do one summer I had this job where we had to boycott this man&#8217;s store because he was charging the minorities, mostly black people, more money for the food that he was selling in his store.  And the program, the summer program I was working in we had to boycott and picket his store.  I didn&#8217;t like that.  But I did do it but I didn&#8217;t like it.  I didn&#8217;t like it for a lot of reasons.  One, walking and people throwing things at you and saying nasty things to you.  That&#8217;s the part that bothered me.  Actively involved in other civil rights issues.  My mother&#8217;s father lived around the corner in Selma at the bridge that Martin Luther King, they had the march from Selma to Montgomery.  So I knew about all of that stuff, but I was never actively involved in any of that.    WT:  So tell me more about your father&#8217;s involvement.  BE:  Oh my father was, my dad, the reason why my family came to New Jersey.  My father was really, really I&#8217;m going to say a little militant in Alabama, and my grandfather being a minster was very, very well known in the community.  He owned a lot of property and he had the respect of a lot of the Caucasians in the neighborhood.  As a matter of fact my grandfather&#8217;s house was surrounded by other Caucasians, which was very unusual during that time.  But because of his being a minister and because he was well known and he was very accepted by Caucasians during that time.  But my father on the other hand was always getting in trouble because he wouldn&#8217;t yes, sir and no, sir the white people in the town.  The sheriff would come and tell my grandfather, and my father would not take stuff off of Caucasians.  He would fight them if they bothered him.  And the sheriff told my grandfather, look, we arrest your son and he&#8217;s just not going to do, he&#8217;s just not going to do what we want him to do.  And if you don&#8217;t get him out of this town, we can&#8217;t promise you that nothing won&#8217;t happen.  We&#8217;re coming to tell you this because we respect you in this town.  And my grandfather sent my father to Florida but&#8212;well, not to Florida.  My father was supposed to come to New Jersey.  My uncle came down from Jersey, but my father didn&#8217;t want to go to Jersey.  He wanted to go to Florida.  So my mom and I came to New Jersey and that&#8217;s how I got to New Jersey.  Other than that I guess I would&#8217;ve been in Florida and we wouldn&#8217;t be doing this.  But that&#8217;s how I got to New Jersey.  Later my father came to Jersey.  WT:  Do you feel that moving to New Jersey gave you an advantage in regards to maybe education or expressing yourself more freely or living more freely?  BE:  Well, I really can&#8217;t say because, I really can&#8217;t say that.  Because in Macon County where I was born, Tuskegee then, Tuskegee Institute, most of my family went to that school, went to that college.  So I can&#8217;t say that, I don&#8217;t know.  I don&#8217;t know.  I think we all have a different path in life and I think this was where I was supposed to be.    NS:  I have one more.  What do you see the difference between progress, do you see any difference between your, when you were here living here and the women that come in today?  BE:  Oh I lot has changed.  I can see progress and no progress in the nineteen years that I've been a part of this.  I can see the progress as far as the house is concerned.  There&#8217;s been a lot of changed, good changes in the house.  NS:  Can you explain some of those good changes.  BE:  They&#8217;ve added on rooms.  I think their funding, we&#8217;ve gotten more funding.  I think length of stay is a little bit longer, but as far as the women coming in, I think it&#8217;s more women now with more issues, more drug and substance abuse issues that go hand in hand often times with domestic violence.  More children, younger, younger women, younger women.  More women of different backgrounds.  Not just Latino women.  We have Asian women coming in now.  So that&#8217;s different from when I was here.  We didn&#8217;t have any Asian women coming in when I lived here.  We didn&#8217;t have a lot of Latino women coming in I was here.  We had that more now.    WT:  Where do you see yourself in the women&#8217;s movement?  BE : I like to say, I like to say I would like to see myself more vocal on women&#8217;s issues.  That we do matter.  We&#8217;re just not, we&#8217;re not that disposable.  We have a lot to offer.  I don&#8217;t think we get the respect that is due to us that we are smart.  We&#8217;re just not baby makers.  That we have a lot to offer, and I see myself as being, as I get older and more outspoken on women&#8217;s issues and women&#8217;s rights, we have a right to do what we want to do with our bodies.  The government does not have a right to tell us what to do with our bodies.  No one does.  It doesn&#8217;t matter about our race or our religion.  It&#8217;s up to us to make that choice.  That&#8217;s my personal opinion.  It&#8217;s up to us to make that choice, and I don&#8217;t try to force my opinions on anyone.  But I think that we are a very valuable asset and we&#8217;ve been overlooked.  WT:  So how would you describe your role at this agency?  BE:  Well, I come with a frame of reference, when women come here, especially older women because when I came here I was in my forties, and I figured I should&#8217;ve known better.  But again domestic violence doesn&#8217;t know about age.  So when a woman comes in that is in that age bracket, I can make her feel comfortable because I can identify with some of the things that she&#8217;s feeling.  And when the younger women come in, I can talk to them the same way I would talk to my daughter, and I think as we age wisdom starts to set in.  I would like to think that.  Me as a counselor here, I feel that I am a rich resource and I have a lot to offer and a lot to give back.  Because I've said it I don&#8217;t know how many times, this shelter, being at this shelter saved my life because I had no idea what I was going to do because I knew I didn&#8217;t want to go back to the life that I had.  And I knew that it wanted change but I didn&#8217;t know where to begin.    WT:  So can you tell us how this agency was able to help you on your road to recovery?  BE:  Well, the support groups was extremely important and having someone believe in me, believe that okay Bessie I believe that you can do this.  I really do.  And to guide me and just like a little baby learning how to walk, to know that you have someone that&#8217;s standing behind you that in case you fall, they&#8217;re going to be there.  And that&#8217;s what this shelter was for me.  That&#8217;s what the shelter director and all the counselors here that worked here, they were there for me to support me, and that was so so important just knowing that okay, I&#8217;m not here anymore, but if I need to talk or I need something I can always come back to get it.  And that&#8217;s what they gave to me, and that&#8217;s why to me I want to give back so much because I received so much.    WT:  Do you have any questions?  I&#8217;m going to--  [break in recording]  NS:  It stopped.    WT:  So Miss Bessie can you tell us how you&#8217;re able to cope with all the emotional stress that comes with your job?  BE:  Before I go, before I do my intake with any woman, I come into the office and I quietly, I just say a prayer and I ask for guidance while I&#8217;m talking to that woman.  But there&#8217;s times when I have, I've experienced it twice, and those two stories horrify me so bad that I had to stop doing the intake because I felt that I was just going to fall apart because it was just so horrifying to hear those stories from both of those women.  It took a lot out of me.  I had to go home, and I just had to take a nice long shower and just be thankful that that woman is here in this shelter and hopefully she wouldn&#8217;t go back, she wouldn&#8217;t go back.  And we had one lady here, I like to work the evening shift, and the evening shift is important to me because once the women come in and get dinner and done for their kids and get their children settled down and then it&#8217;s, I call it tonight this woman&#8217;s needs come out, you need to talk now.  You can talk about what&#8217;s going on.  So that&#8217;s the shift I like to work.  So if the woman wants to talk we can talk and you can relax and let your hair down and you can just talk and I listen.  There was one woman I was working from four in the afternoon until midnight.  And she was just really, really distraught, and I wanted to check on her before I left and I went up to her room, and she was just really, really sobbing.  And I talked to her for a while, a long time before I left.  And when I came to work the next day, my, the shelter supervisor, she hugged me and I was like, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;  And she said to me, she said, &#8220;Thank you.  We all want to thank you for last night.&#8221;  I was like, &#8220;What did I do?&#8221;  She told me that the woman was thinking about committing suicide that night and I became so emotional because for some reason I just didn&#8217;t want to leave.  I wanted to just talk with her that night.  And that made me feel like wow, I helped save somebody&#8217;s life.  And that made me feel really, I&#8217;m getting a little emotional just thinking about it.  That made me feel really, really good that I was doing a good job, and that was so important for me to be here especially at night.  So I like working at night because you never know.  I mean it could happen during the day.  But that made me say well, this is definitely the shift that I need and I continue working this shift.  So that was really important to me.  WT:  So do you see yourself working with this agency for a long time?  BE:  Well, you know I think burnout, everybody can get burned out and as much as I would say yes, I want to do this forever and ever and ever.  I know eventually one day everything ahs to come to an end, even doing this.  But doing something similar, yeah, I&#8217;ll always do that, always.    WT:  So you think you&#8217;ll still be active in the women&#8217;s movement&#8212;  BE:  Of course.  WT:  But in a different capacity.   BE:  Of course.  WT:  What capacities do you think you could do?  BE:  Well, now I&#8217;m thinking about the women that are in prison that are coming home.  Some of those women that are in prison that&#8212;this society has two different standards.  If a man kills his wife&#8212;I won&#8217;t say he gets this parade or anything like that in a domestic violence situation.  But if a woman kills her husband in a domestic violence situation, society looks at her like oh you did a bad thing and we&#8217;re going to lock you up and throw away the key.  So working on, I mean I don&#8217;t, I wouldn&#8217;t even know where to begin to help get those kind of laws changed.  But working with those kind of women and the children because people don&#8217;t realize the effect domestic violence has on the children, so working with women and children.  And men because I work with mean that batter for a while because I wanted to know the other side.  I wanted to know why men did what they did.  So it was interesting.    WT:  Any questions?  Just to wrap up the interview, what kind of, what do you think in the course of the time that you&#8217;ve been working with the Durham Crisis Response Center, what have been the biggest improvements you&#8217;ve seen?  BE:  We have more staff especially on the crisis line.  We have, staffing is extremely important and we have that now.  We have, we staff to different agencies and we&#8217;re getting a lot of support from different agencies.  So that&#8217;s changed.  That&#8217;s grown.  I think domestic violence has a larger voice now and that&#8217;s a good thing.  And the ongoing training because we&#8217;ve crossed over into other areas where we&#8217;re not just working with, we&#8217;re working with same sex issues now, human trafficking now because that&#8217;s still, exploitation, sexual assault, so I see it&#8217;s opened up more and people are, it&#8217;s not enough but people are paying more attention.  WT:  Do you feel that has like spilled out into the community?  Do you feel like this agency has helped the community&#8217;s perspective?  BE:  Oh definitely, definitely.  Definitely and I think as we grow that&#8217;ll grow also.  Yes.  I do.  WT:  Well, thank you so much for taking the time to interview you Miss Bessie.    NF:  Thank you.  BE:  You&#8217;re welcome.  You&#8217;re welcome.
