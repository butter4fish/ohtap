Story_ID: 72018
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your beginnings.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us the names of your parents and the dates of their--the dates and the places of their birth?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My father's name is Roger Lee Henderson.  He was born in Louisville, Kentucky in like 1917.  And my mother's name is Ruby May (ph.)--her maiden name was Beck, B-E-C-K.  And she was born in 1923 in--right outside of Nashville [Tennessee].  A place close to, called Kingston Springs.  It's close to there, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did they impart to you a story about their meeting, how they met and--
Speaker 2: Well, all I remember is that my mother was, had moved to Louisville and was working there, and somehow they connected.  I'm not really sure how, but I remember my mom tells the story about she worked in, she decorated mannequins in, like, a department store.  And he was, at that time, working at General Electric, the appliance thing there, a factory there.  And I'm not sure how they connected really, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 72019
Speaker 1: Now, did either one of them have a story about--I mean, about--well, stories about their ancestors, you know, from stories from slavery or stories from Reconstruction or--
Speaker 2: Not really.  They really didn't.  I mean, like I heard about my grandmothers from both of them.  And, you know, just sort of the struggles of survival in urban America or, in some cases, sort of in non-industrial America, the farm life, you know, that kind of thing.  But my mother [Ruby Henderson], you know, had growing up, had an assortment of jobs.  Like she worked in, you know, as many of them did, it's, you know, in white folks' houses, for example, in the early years.  And because in that part of Tennessee, there was, where the, sort of the opportunities were at that point.  She ended up going to Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] for a little bit.  But part of it, what I think was--I think she went to--no, I think it was--yeah, Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] or Tennessee State for a little bit.  But then she moved.  Actually moved to Kentucky.  But my father [Roger Lee Henderson], after high school, went directly--he worked for L and N [Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company], the railroad.  And he worked, and he told me some stories about just, you know, like life as a--in the railroad industry.  He actually rode on the trains and that sort of thing, so.
Speaker 1: So your father was from Louisville [Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did he serve in the War, World War II?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.  He didn't 'cause he's like seventy, you know.  He would--he actually died about, you know, in 1997.  So I think at that time he--his first wife died, and so he was a single parent for a little while before he met my mother.  So I think that that's what prevented him from going into one of the wars or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have any--did either one of them have any stories that you remember about their growing up that they told you?
Speaker 2: Well, I just remember my mother always spoke--well, both of them always talked about just how endurance is a major part of life.  You know, being able to hold on until things get better.  And that dates back to just being in situations where, whether you're working for people who don't necessarily respect you.  You know, but at the same time, you know, you just do what you have to do, you know, until the situation gets better.  And there were times--I mean, my mom actually worked at General Electric as well, and she was a janitress.  And she would tell me stories of how sometimes she was really mistreated by her boss.  And she would go into the bathroom to clean them, and she would go into a stall and she would cry and get herself together.  You know what I mean, and then come back out.  But I always remember those kinds of stories because, you know, it taught me that life is not always going to be easy, and everything is not going to necessarily work in your favor, but that if you hold on, you know, it'll get better.
Story_ID: 72020
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then you never met your grandparents?
Speaker 2: No.  Both of them--because my mom [Ruby Henderson] actually had me when she was 39, almost 40.  So she tells the story that she thought I was a hernia.  Either I was a hernia, or she was going through the change.  She always says that.  And she went to the doctor, and when they told her that she was pregnant--because there's a big gap between my brother---I mean, like thirteen years, almost thirteen, fourteen years.
Speaker 1: So you have an older brother?
Speaker 2: I have, yeah, I have two brothers, two older brothers and an older sister.  So it's a big gap between my brother.  So it's--we're talking, like, about thirteen, fourteen years difference, that when they, when she went to the doctor and found out she was pregnant, and she told my dad [Roger Lee Henderson] and he about died 'cause if she's like thirty-nine, he had to be about forty-four, almost forty-five.  To have a baby was something that they, neither of one of them expected.
Speaker 1: What, was it different being raised by older parents?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, because like your parents were the same age as most people's grandparents, you know.  So it was really different, but I loved the stage where they were because for me, hearing from my brothers and sisters, they were like two different sets of parents, because they were mellow, you know.  They were like grandparents, you know.  They--they rules, the had experienced life a lot more.  They weren't sort of stressed out.  They spent a lot of time and they invested time in me, taking me to places and getting me involved in activities.  I never had to worry about, you know, with my mom [Ruby Henderson]--would somebody pick me up, you know, or if I wanted to do something, could I do it?  She, they were always available and willing to try to work their schedule around me, so that was real, real helpful.
Story_ID: 72021
Speaker 1: Okay.  Kind of think back to, you know, reflect on some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Louisville [Kentucky].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And you lived there until the seventh grade, right?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I grew up in the West End, which is normally African American community, and you really didn't travel that much.  I mean, like that West End, you sort of stayed there.  Our church initially was not that far.  It was like in South Louisville, really.  And my mom at that time, she was--growing up.  My mom [Ruby Henderson]--so I really, always a churchgoer, major churchgoer, always active in the church.
Speaker 1: What denomination?
Speaker 2: Baptist.  And she--I mean, she lived in church.  And I went with her, and she would go to like visit the sick at the hospital and she would park--I remember her parking in clergy spaces, you know (laughter).  And I'd say, "It says clergy, mom."  She's like, "Everybody's a minister," and she'd park in there, and we'd go in hospitals.  We'd go to funeral homes.  People used to laugh, too, 'cause they'll say, you know, he's going to grow up really weird, you know, you dragging him to all these funeral homes, but I went to funerals all the time.  And that was sort of how I experienced life with her, you know.  Tuesday nights, she went to Bible study or teachers' meetings.  She always taught Sunday school.  So Tuesday night, you know, little Angelo, the toddler, or Angelo, the elementary kid, would be kicking around some church waiting for his mom to get out of church.
Story_ID: 72022
Speaker 1: And my father [Roger Lee Henderson], in addition to working, when he left the L and N Railroad, he went to work for General Electric, and he also sold Cadillacs in the evenings, so he had two jobs.  So he was a Cadillac salesman.  He was the only African American, the only brother selling Cadillacs in Louisville [Kentucky].  So he would, you know, give everybody when, you know, when their relatives died, he'd provide the fleet of limos and all the major players who wanted to buy Cadillacs, you know, he would be the broker.  You know, he'd be the person that would sell them Cadillacs.  So we always had a Cadillac every year.  I told them when I was in high school that I wish you kept that job.  I could have really appreciated it,(laughter) you know, once I started driving.  But by that time, you know, he had stopped working there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did you grow up in the same neighborhood that Muhammad Ali grew up?
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.  In fact, my sister-in-law went to school with Muhammad Ali, Central [Central High School, Louisville, Kentucky].  And my brother actually went to the same school, not at the same time, but he went to Central, as well.  So, oh, yeah, there was all those stories about Muhammad Ali around there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you were a toddler when he was winning championships?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, without a doubt.  I don't even remember him fighting, really.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 72023
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, what about other things?  I mean, what did you like to do as a young man?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was a--I always enjoyed music.  And when I was in high school, I sang in something called Louisville Youth Choir.  Always sang in church, and I was active in the Boy Scouts, Webelos, did that at an early age.  While I was in Louisville, I also---I'm trying to think of some of the other things I was involved in.  I'm trying to think--part of it was because of the break.  I went, you know, like I was telling you, I went--I left in seventh grade, went to California, came back.  So some of my Louisville projects or really activities, were more sort of on the senior high school end than it was the, before seventh grade, so that's why it's kind of hard for me.  Other than sort of, 4-H, I was involved in.  And I did a lot of when I was in--I had one professor, one high school teacher, that encouraged me to do a lot of speaking, and so I participated in a lot of oratorical contests when I was in middle school.
Story_ID: 72024
Speaker 1: Let's go to back grade school for a minute.
Speaker 2: Okay, grade school.  Okay.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not too far.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But what did--did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  School was always a good place.  I never really had a problem with it.  And I was never really a troublemaker or anything like that.  I was a pretty mellow kid, you know, pretty easy going.  I think that's what happens when you have sort of older parents (laughter).
Speaker 1: Older brothers and sisters, too or-(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of them thought they were my parents, you know.
Speaker 1: You had a lot of guidance, I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Everybody had two cents.  I had to remind them, some of them who actually was my mother and father oftentimes (laughter).
Speaker 1: I can imagine that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 72025
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that stood out in school or any other mentors in the community besides your parents and your, your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Well, my godparents played a major role.  I always went over there on Sundays and I spent time with them, Mattie and Nathaniel Adams.  Every Sunday after church, my mother [Ruby Henderson] would just--I would basically go home with them, and then she would pick me up.  My parents would pick me up in the evenings on Sundays.  So it was a ritual every Sunday until about, you know, 6:00 o'clock, I was there.  So they played a major role.  And my godmother's mother, Mary Trotter, was like a grandmother figure for me, so she played a critical role.  And it really was, that sort of sense of community.  We really didn't have a big family.  Most of my family lived in other places, you know.  My brothers and sisters actually moved away from Kentucky largely, except for my oldest brother.  So, I mean, it wasn't like I had, you know, because my mother only had only one brother.  He died at an early age.  My father [Roger Lee Henderson] had one sister, and my aunt, I would say, definitely, Thelma Peas (ph.), she was also influential because that was his only, his main--his only sister so.
Story_ID: 72026
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what happened in the seventh grade?  What were those things?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to visit my sister [Elaine Henderson Smith] who lived in California, in Oakland.  At that time, San Leandro.  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: There was a reason why you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, I just went to visit for the summer.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: But what happened was while I was there, they were really televising, getting--showing everybody the pictures and the activity surrounding forced busing, and forced integration was starting there in Louisville [Kentucky].  And during that summer, they decided that, like part of my street was going to one school and, you know, across the street, they were going to another.  And I was actually going to one of, probably one of the whitest schools in the area, and it was about an hour away from my street, you know, where I lived.  And there were--it was Ku Klux Klan country basically.  There were, you know, showing, you know, people with signs, picketing.  You know, they didn't want this happening.  And my mother [Ruby Henderson] was really fearful for me to be entering into that environment.  And, at the same time, she thought between the bus travel and the sort of all this protesting that, really, what kind of education would I get?  So she asked me if I would, if I wanted to stay there in California and go to school and live with my sister.  And I said, "Sure, I'll do that," and so that's what happened.
Story_ID: 72027
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--how was Oakland different from Louisville--(unclear) (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: Quite different.  I mean, Louisville [Kentucky] was, you know, because like we had a little African American section, you know, that I knew of, the West part of Louisville.  Oakland [California] was pretty much an African American city, much like Detroit [Michigan] is.  And it was really interesting to see the numbers of African Americans, and all the variety of jobs and leadership positions.  And it was, you know--and I ended up going to school there at Redeemer Lutheran [Our Redeemer Lutheran School, Oakland, California], and then over to St. Mary's College High School [Berkeley, California].  And I just was exposed to a lot of people and, plus, it was close to San Francisco [California], and I had never seen a city that large before.  So having access to all the arts and entertainment venues, recreation in the whole Bay area really, really was life changing for me.
Story_ID: 72028
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the high school like at--(unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, I actually went to Lutheran School [Our Redeemer Lutheran School, Oakland, California] first there.  And then when I went to St. Mary's High School [St. Mary's College High School, Berkeley, California], it was a predominantly--well, at least 50-50 African American, which was pretty interesting, too, to have a private school, Catholic, and, you know, about fifty percent African American at that point.  So there were a lot of us there, in an all-boys Catholic school.  But it was really, really great in that the education--the focus of education, was really, really strong.  We changed classes.  It was actually on a huge campus, and with a lot of professors, hands-on sorts of instructions.  So it really, I think it really helped my development quite a bit.  And then my sister [Elaine Henderson Smith] was really into education, so I would go to classes at Laney Community College [Laney College, Oakland, California] there in Oakland.  And I would--actually, as a seventh grader, it's, you know, eighth grader, and ninth grader, take classes at Laney Community College, sit in on classes, and we did that there and also Alameda Community College [College of Alameda, Alameda, California], as well.
Story_ID: 72029
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you remember any professors or teachers and--well, teachers then that had a particular interest in you or helped you develop?
Speaker 2: Teachers, I remember the names of teachers, like Ms. Branch in third grade.  And I remember, like, Ms. Jefferson in sixth grade.  And I remember our principal at Redeemer Lutheran [Our Redeemer Lutheran School, Oakland, California] was really a--I just remember, you know, that he was always favorable, always fair, equitable kind of guy.  As I keep going through, I'm thinking at St. Mary's [St. Mary's College High School, Berkeley, California], there was a brother who taught art, which got me into Jacob Lawrence, and I started appreciating a lot of African American artists but--
Speaker 1: Can you remember his name?
Speaker 2: Can't remember his name, though--can't remember his name.  But that opened up my world to sort of show me that, you know, African Americans, what they contributed to the sort of cultural arts and the artistic world.
Story_ID: 72030
Speaker 1: And then, you know, my--we went to church and also too, the ministers, I mean, because, you know, I told you my mom [Ruby Henderson] was really involved in the church.  I remember Reverend Herschel Martin was our pastor when I was growing up, and he was really very friendly, you know, a friendly guy and very--to represent, was definitely a mentor, you know, from afar, just being able to see him.  So there were always ministers, and I was in and around so many churches that there were always high profile ministers in my life where, you know, who I could say, you know, that that guy was either a profound speaker or a great leader.
Story_ID: 72031
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you feel about being separated from your parents in Oakland [California]?  Was that tough at first?
Speaker 2: It was kind of tough at first, but my sister [Elaine Henderson Smith] is really adventurous.  I always give her credit for being--bringing me out to be the kind of person that I am today because my parents, because they were older and sort of traditional.  My sister was younger.  She's always on the go.  She, you know, juggles twenty things at once and still does that today, and she, you know, she would always come up with some kind of creative event or activity.  She was into exposing us to--she had two children at that time--exposing us to everything.  I mean, like, for example, we would participate in Boy Scouts, right?  Well, she would find the most affluent neighborhood in Oakland.  And she would figure out what Boy Scout troop catered to that area, and we would catch the bus and go there and join that troop because she felt like those were places that have more opportunity.  So we did that, and she was always finding kind of venues, camps, you know, any kind of camp, she would send us to.  There was--I took organ lessons.  I mean, you know, in the Hills, Oakland Hills.  She really tried to not let whatever the current environment was and she, at that time, she was an accountant.  And at that time, she had worked at International Harvester, but she was really into sort of, you know, expose you to everything.  And she definitely opened my world and showed me that there was, you know, lots of things in life that I could accomplish without a doubt.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she kept you really busy?
Speaker 2: Oh, very busy, very busy.  I played basketball when I was in eighth grade, played tennis, you know, all through my high school career.  She got me into tennis when I was there living in California.
Story_ID: 72032
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you eventually moved back to Louisville [Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: Right.  I moved back to Louisville and went to high school there.  Like eleventh--part of tenth grade and eleventh grade.  And then I graduated from high school there in Louisville, Male Traditional High School [Louisville Male High School, Louisville, Kentucky], in fact.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was trying to read this.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's okay.  Just high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I moved back there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: And at that time, Louisville was different.  I mean, it was different for me because I--
Speaker 1: It changed?
Speaker 2: --I had grown up, you know.  I was, you know, I had spent my teenage years, my early adolescent years, in California.  I, basically, came back to Louisville sort of exposed to the world, you know, having caught the subways, lived in San Francisco [California].  Louisville was a much smaller city then to me, compared with what I was used to--accustomed to.  School, I went to, and it's almost like a--I'm trying to think of the name of the programs that they have now.  It's like a charter school, sort of, but it was a traditional program in that it was called Male Traditional high school.  It focused on the--like English, you know, science, history.  It was the basics.  You didn't have study halls.  You didn't have all these bunch of electives.  I mean, you declared a major when you were like a sophomore, and so that the academic program was real rigorous, you know.  We had really, really intense--every, there was homework required.  At that time, the traditional program was really pretty young.  And so there were homework requirements in every class; two quizzes in every class a week, at least two or three, a test every week in every class.  It was, you know--I had bookbags, man, with, you know, that used to almost weigh me down.  And because it was one of these, like type schools of choice that if you couldn't cut it academically, you could always go into a regular public school setting.  So--
Speaker 1: It was like a magnet school?
Speaker 2: It was like a magnet school, exactly.  And it focused on academics, so that really prepped me from a knowledge standpoint.  I thought when I left California, you know, that I was, you know, tough and you know what I mean, academically prepared.  But going into that, I really had to work.  I mean, it was not easy for me at all.  I mean, I remember my mom [Ruby Henderson] would get me up at five o'clock in the morning when she and my father [Roger Lee Henderson] left for work.  And I would study for tests and quizzes at five o'clock in the morning until time for me to walk down the street and catch the bus to school.  And I always caught the public transportation, the city bus, because it was much closer for me to get to school that way.  But I often studied early in the wee hours of morning.
Story_ID: 72033
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have a sense or did you exhibit any writing talent at that point, or did you have a sense that you wanted to a journalist or a writer?
Speaker 2: Well, I love reports, I always loved reports.  And I always would do creative things.  In fact, I saved some of them at my mom's [Ruby Henderson] house, but where I would visually, like, find a magazine--like, for example, if I did something on Thomas Edison, I'd find pictures of Thomas Edison, include that, you know.  I always tried to be real artistic with my presentation.  But I didn't really know that I had a, really gift for writing.  But I got interested in journalism when I was in high school when I was at Male Traditional [Louisville Male High School, Louisville, Kentucky].  I went to a--the "Courier Journal" there in Louisville had a program where urban kids would go and spend a week basically studying journalism at a college.  And my counselor recommended that I go, and so I went for an interview there.  And while I was there at an interview at the "Courier Journal" for this program at the University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky], which was called Urban Journalism Program workshop, Urban Journalism Workshop, they asked me, they said, well, there was an opening for another program at the Medill School of Journalism in Evanston [Illinois].  And you would spend, like, four or five weeks studying journalism.  And there were high school kids from all over the country that would be there, not just Louisville, like the University of Kentucky program, and would I be interested?  So I interviewed and got accepted.  Actually, they paid for me, typing lessons at the community college there in Louisville [Kentucky].  It was, like, a tech school and because that was one of the requirements for this Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] program, you had to know how to type. And it was called the National High School Institute, and it's called the Cherub Program is what it's known as.  And they have different specialties, and it still goes on today.  I've actually been back to speak to the Cherub Group at Northwestern at the Medill School.  But I went there for the summer, and that's when I really learned about writing.  I learned the difference between news, features.  I learned about writing on deadline.  They had these things called, all-day stories.  And they were incredible because they would start--I remember in early in the morning, like at 8:00 o'clock.  Say there was a satellite, a rocket that was going up, so you'd write a story real quick about the launch of the rocket.  And they would have people come in, you know, and say, I'm the scientist, you know, that created the rocket, and this is the guy who set the path, the flight plan.  And you'd, the whole class would interview them, and then you'd have so many minutes to write, based on your interview.  Then about fifteen, thirty minutes later, they would start again.  And they would say, okay, you know, we've lost the space ship.  We can't find the satellite.  It just disappeared off our radar screen.  So we would start typing, you know, now that we can't, you know, somehow like an AP [Associated Press] story, it's shifting, you know.  Now, those that organized say they can't find it.  Then they'd say, it's headed for downtown Chicago [Illinois].  You have to go run--there's a woman who's on the beach there who can give you more information.  So we'd take our notebooks.  So we'd run to the beach, and we'd interview the lady there.
Speaker 1: You'd actually go to the beach?
Speaker 2: We'd go to the beach, right.  We'd go to the beach.  And all of us would interview her.  Are you worried, what are you doing now?  She'd say, naw, and she--it would be a grad student saying, "Oh, let me know, I'm going crazy.  I'm moving my kids.  We're packing our cars up and we got all this stuff because we're fearful that this thing is gonna to crash on us."  And then we'd run back to the office, run back to the classroom, and write up that interview.  And then they'd say, bring in some more, but it did.  It was an all day--and it didn't end until like 5:00 o'clock.  So you had, like, these developing stories all day, and it was so much work.
Story_ID: 72034
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I learned so much.  We actually covered a parade with real people.  And it was the first time that I had actually interviewed someone I didn't know.  Like we did, like, little mini-profiles where we--you'd pick a professor on campus, and you interview them.  But to actually go to a street, you know, at a--it was a fair, like a parade going on.  And I remember walking around in circles.  I'd identify this mother with her kids that I was going to talk to.  And I remember walking back and forth, sink (unclear) in my guts, I'm okay.  You have to go and ask her questions.  Okay.  You have to, you know, it's like this feeling that you're--she's watching the parade and you're--here you are, gonna bust up into her space, and ask her a question and, you know, she's going to be inconvenienced.  And--but I got my guts up and I went over, and I interviewed her and talked to her.  But at the same time, too, every night whenever we'd turn in our assignments, the grad students would--we had all, one particular counselor.  Lisa Bass, for example, was my counselor, and I've seen her.  She actually lives in DC [Washington, D.C.] now, but she would write all kinds of notes on your paper, and sometimes she was really critical.  I mean, very, very critical, and we would--and I had a friend, Linda Jones, who I'm still friends with today, and she was both of our counselors, so we would go and we would, you know, we would get so frustrated.  I remember one time she said, you are regressing, you know.  And I'd just--I was like, oh, but, you know, the bar was so high.  But I realize now, you know, having been through the process and everything, these were grad students who had been basically, you know, they'd gone through that their whole college career.  So, now, it was time to get people back, you know, and I just happened to be a victim, but it was a good thing, it was a good thing.
Speaker 2: So you were a junior in high school or a senior?
Speaker 1: I was a junior in high school then.
Speaker 2: A junior?
Speaker 1: Right.  And we had like, I think, like one of the Silverman's son was there from CBS.  It was all kinds of people, kids from all over the place that I learned a lot from, so great exposure.
Story_ID: 72035
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: But you're talking about your sister?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Your sister--say that again
Speaker 1: Yeah.  When I look at people who really influenced my life, outside of my parents, I would have to say my sister, Elaine Henderson, who's now Elaine Henderson Smith, because she was so--at that time, she was a single parent, but she was so adventurous.  She was such a risk taker and she wanted to experience life.  She wanted to taste life herself and she wanted us to taste life.  And she would do things, like wake up in the morning and say, you know, let's go--have you ever wanted to parachute?  Let's check and see how it works, you know, or she would find some creative--
Speaker 2: Did you do that?
Speaker 1: We actually went to like a class, we've learned, we had to go to a class and all this to do it so--
Speaker 2: Did you jump out of a plane?
Speaker 1: No, so we didn't, we never made it to the plane stage, but we checked it out, you know.  She loved flowers, for example, and we would go to the port in San Francisco [California].  And like 2:00 in the morning when the ships came in with all the fresh flowers and, you know, they leave most--a lot of them on the ground.  We would collect fresh flowers.  She was just always finding some interesting place to visit or to experience.  And so, she totally, always opened my eyes to that kind of thing.  And she would--I remember she bought a house once.  And we, each of us, she had a son and a daughter, and Mark, who is about four years, five years younger than I am, and my niece, Veronica.  She was--when I was in, like, for example, we all went to the same school.  And Veronica was in kindergarten; Mark was in third grade; and I was in eighth.  So, but we all got to, like, paint our room any kind of color we wanted, you know, in the house.  But she was so into just, you know, you have--in life, you know, life is given to you, and it's what you make it.  And you have to always go out and seek and try to find it.  So she created this whole adventurous side, you know.  And I--when I talk about sort of how I became to get this sort of journalistic mindset, part of it is--
Story_ID: 72036
Speaker 1: --she's a major factor.  But my father [Roger Lee Henderson], at the same time growing up, was always curious about everything.  He was a kind of brother that if there was an ambulance on the street, you would see him out there with his house slippers on, trying to figure out what's going on, you know.  If we're driving down the street and a fire truck passes, it was nothing for us to circle around and follow the fire truck.  Or you see, there's accidents on the freeways.  And, now, I get upset sometimes 'cause, you know, you're driving, and you realize the accidents are not even on your side, but saw these gawkers.  Well, my father guaranteed that he'd be peering off some kind of--he'd be pulled over and come check it out, you know.  He was always ready to check it out.  And I was always behind him, you know, checking it out, so I think he sort of created that whole curiosity side.  And the risk-taking side, I think, came from my sister.  And then the whole faith and spiritual side came from my mother.  So, and then you merge Kentucky, Louisville and Oakland, California, and you get this, like, bizarre combination, which helps create who I am, you know, for sure.
Story_ID: 72037
Speaker 1: And what did your sister [Elaine Henderson Smith] do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was an accountant at International Harvester, and she got totally bored with it, you know, math and accounting came very simplistic to her.  And she decided to leave Louisville [Kentucky] and go to California.  She had never been there.  You know, she only visited, I think, but she had no job.  What she had, like, at International Harvester had a division there at first, so she just moved there cold, took her two kids, and decided to go.  I'm going to move to California.  And she did that for a little while, and then she decided to become a teacher where she felt like there was really more value in life, you know, giving back to kids, so she remains a teacher today.  She moved from Oakland [California] recently to Las Vegas [Nevada] with her husband, and now they're looking at possibly even moving back to California.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: But, yeah, so that may have played a major role. But--
Story_ID: 72038
Speaker 1: --As far as journalism training, that summer program at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] in that National High School Institute, they had it for the arts.  They had it for, I think, engineering.  And I did the one for journalism and we were, like I said, were called sort of The Cherubs, and it was just incredibly enlightening.  I mean, it taught me about words.  It taught me on how to write a feature story.  It taught me the difference between news and interviewing strategies.  I mean, I really got an idea of what it's like to really be a journalist.  Up until then, I really wanted--I thought I wanted to be an attorney.  It was either I'm going to be a lawyer or a journalist.  And after that summer program, I really, really, really liked journalism.  And I worked on my high school [Louisville Male High School, Louisville, Kentucky] yearbook in Kentucky and that, you know, gave me a little bit of--
Speaker 2: Your senior year?
Speaker 1: My senior year.
Story_ID: 72039
Speaker 1: And what was really interesting after my senior year, the following summer, you know, the original program I told you about, the Urban Journalism Workshop, which is a "Dow Jones" newspaper funded one week at a university where they take urban kids, basically, out of the hood and expose them to, you know, sort of a college campus for a week.  I was selected the following summer to go to that original program, Urban Journalism Program at the University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky].  And I studied journalism there for a week on campus.  And I was actually editor of the newspaper for that week and had a staff.  And that was kind of different because, whereas, I was really writing and spending a lot of summer time--this previous summer writing and learning about journalism.  We were actually putting out, producing a newspaper at the University of Kentucky that summer, and I had a staff.  And I remember everybody had deadlines and there was one, like, Wednesday in the middle of the week, everyone was getting discouraged because they couldn't find the people or they weren't finishing their stories, so they all decided to quit.  They said they were just not going to do it.  So I was panicky.  I said, "How can you just--you can't just not do it, you know, we got to put out a newspaper."  And so that was really--that's, you know, that was--it showed me sort of another part of the world.  And as a result of that summer experience, I really wanted to go to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] initially, but it's really an expensive school and I couldn't afford it.  And having spent the week at the University of Kentucky, I really liked that school a lot, and I got to interface with the newspaper there, you know, the college newspaper there.  And, so, anyway, that's why I decided to go.
Story_ID: 72040
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your senior year, you were pretty much set.  You knew where you were going--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, definitely, definitely.  And, in fact, my freshman year at the University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky], one of the first days that week, I started the newspaper, the college newspaper, which was the daily--they actually produced the "Kentucky Colonel," was a daily independent student-run newspaper.  It ran Monday through Friday, came out every day.  It was student run, student-run publication, so it wasn't like it was independent from the school.  We competed with the "Lexington Herald Leader," which is the, you know, the daily metro newspaper there in Lexington and wrote about everything.  I started off covering African American organizations largely, fraternity, sororities, and then I gradually moved up as the years progressed to cover the medical center, the medical beat, which was really quite intense in that it was college of, like, nursing, college of pharmacy, college of allied health, college of dentistry, college of medicine, as well as the UK [University of Kentucky] Medical Center, the hospital itself.  And that was the time when I remember HIV/AIDS was coming, you know, it was really starting to hit.  And, so, I was writing about, not only medical things related to the medical school, they were actually building a hospital, but also science-related topics.  And I did that, and then I think that's what helped me actually get an internship.  My first summer I spent out in California, and I did, like, a--just some freelance writing for one of the community newspapers.
Story_ID: 72041
Speaker 1: The second summer, I interned in television at WHAS, which was at that time, a CBS affiliate in Louisville [Kentucky].  And I just stopped by there.  I remember one day when I was at home from college, I stopped in the television station and asked them, did they have internships, because I thought television might be something I'd want to pursue.  And I put together a packet of my clips that I had, you know, from the newspaper and landed a television internship, which was great, that summer.  So I worked a lot, learned TV, you know, inside and out.  I didn't realize, though, that I really liked newspapers a little better and, plus, at the time, print journalists--a lot of the African Americans who worked at the "Courier Journal" were my mentors.  And, you know, print folks can be pretty tough on broadcast folks.  So they were like, "You need to be a print reporter and not TV, you know.  This is real journalism," you know, and they used to, you know, try to drill into me.  So I kind of got intimidated and decided, well, I should stay away from TV and just, you know, do my thing, do my print thing, so.
Story_ID: 72042
Speaker 1: So--but having then after that following summer, I actually landed an internship at "The Wall Street Journal" in Cleveland [Ohio].  And I think some of it was based on the fact that I had that medical beat because I was able to get--write about a lot of technical issues and a lot of technical stories, which I think may be a little bit attractive to "The Wall Street Journal."  So I spent the summer in Cleveland at "The Wall Street Journal," and when I came back from that summer, I was so turned on to business journalism, because I realized that business journalism was really about people.  It's not just about numbers.  And I had never made that connection before "The Wall Street Journal," plus, it taught me how important, really intensified my knowledge on writing and word usage and asking questions until you fully understand.  They used to have to say, you know, I don't care how many times you call them back.  Tell people that when you start off, you're going to call them back numerous times until you figure it out and, oftentimes, I call analysts or I'd call people and say, you know, I'm going to call you back, and call you back.  And, you know, it used to be--I had this fear before that you had to ask all the questions that one--you had that one time, but that's not true, you know.  And, oftentimes, advise kids today, get people's home telephone numbers that--who you interview because later you may think of something.  And, you know, you don't know how to reach these people, so a lot of those lessons that I learned at "The Wall Street Journal" early on really stuck with me.  But when I got back to campus, I was, like, a special projects editor for the college newspaper.  But I really wanted to continue this business journalism venue that I'd been exposed to during the summer.  So we had something called independent study, where you can go outside of the university and create your own independent study programs.  So I worked with the journalism professor, Maria Brayton (ph.), who was a big, big mentor for me.  She used to be an AP [Associated Press] reporter when she was a journalism professor at UK [University of Kentucky, Louisville, Kentucky].  She helped me devise a program where I would write two retail stories, two auto-related stories, two banking stories, two real estate stories.  We came up with this whole segment in for like a four-to-six-week period, I would go to "The Herald Leader."  I mean, this pitch they agreed.  I would actually go to the night winter paper and I would write, work on these stories.  And then when I finished them, I would turn them in, you know, when they were published, I would turn them in as an independent study, and I got a grade.  Well, it was so cool, such a great experience for me because here I am in college working in a regular newspaper.  And they liked it so well that when my internship, my independent study, was over, it basically became an internship in the fall--in the spring, I only had one class like Spanish. So I worked there basically full time as a college kid on the business desk at "The Herald Leader."  And John Carroll was a major factor in that he was actually the publisher, the editor rather, at "The Herald Leader" at that time.  And, now, he's the editor of the "Los Angeles Times" today.
Story_ID: 72043
Speaker 1: So it's been--so, but, giving me the opportunity actually to work in a real newsroom.  And I remember I would finish--I would need to work on stories, and I would recruit some of my friends in college to come down with me to the newspaper because, you know, I had access.  I had, you know, employee ID and everything.  And I went, and I said, "So you need to study tonight?"  And they're like, "Yeah."  I said, "Come on down, I need to work on my story."  So I'd drag them to the newspaper.  One of the pluses of work--of coming down with me, was that you got to use the WATS [wide area telephone service] line, the telephone line, that you could call all your friends and all your family and everything.  So the cause are just pretty good 'cause we're all broke and everything, right.  So people all would say, "You need to go to the newspaper tonight?" 'cause, you know, they need to call their grandma, or they need to call their mom back.  And they could come there and while I was working, they would use the telephone.  In fact, I spoke to the "Lexington Herald Leader" this past summer and in my presentation, I thanked them for, among the other things, having a WATS line 'cause it helped me, you know, to make me who I am today as a result of that.  But that was a great experience.  And that was real journalism, and that's sort of how some college and the business world worked together, because I realized that in this business, you need to write, you need to work for your college newspaper and, you know, you need to produce.  And we got paid, I don't know, it was, like, eight bucks a story.  It was something, $8 to $10, maybe $12 a story at that time when I--for my college newspaper.  And when I started working for "The Herald Leader," I actually got a real check, you know, which was also pretty cool to do. But in being exposed to those journalists, the professional journalists, at that time, too, really, really helped me.  And so, between all the internships and working that when I graduated from college, I had a real thick clip file with lots of experience, so I was trying to figure out where I wanted to work.  We also did a lot of the jobs--they have lot of trade fairs for students, journalism students, and they have specific ones targeting minorities in journalism.  So I went to, like, the Cowart Conference (ph.).  They had one, and also "New York Newsday."  And, in fact, my college roommate and I both majored in journalism, Everett Mitchell.  And he and I would--sometimes we would drive in our car, in his car, 'cause I had like a hooptie.  This was in the late 80's [1980s] and I had, like, a '71 [1971] LTD, so my car would have never made it. (laughter)  But he had--well, we would drive to New York to these job fairs.  I remember one job fair we went to, it was snowing, and we actually did a 360 in the snow and the ice, trying to get to these job fairs, so we can actually meet with the different recruiters at the newspapers because there were opportunities that we really didn't get on campus.  Sometimes recruiters would come to UK [University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky], but we never were in the loop, or on the list to interview with them. But when we went to these job fairs, we could, you know, really meet with people at major newspapers-Chicago [Illinois], Atlanta [Georgia].  I mean, all the places you ever want to work when you're in journalism, you know, you could get to see and touch and feel, and they could tell you what you need to do.  And they would always say, you got to write; you got to keep writing; you got to keep writing.  So we did that for about two, almost three years.  We did the job fair circuit, so we were familiar with all the different newspaper recruiters.
Story_ID: 72044
Speaker 1: We had relationships with them, and so that really helped when it talked about employment.  I remember my first job.  I actually--it was this weird strategy where big newspapers would shoot you down, you know, you'd go to like the Chicago Tribune.  They would just hurt your feelings, you know, because you're so young.  You're a sophomore or a junior, you know.  You have to work five years in the business before you can even think about working here.  And they ripped apart your clips and, you know, tell you that you need a lot of work, you know.  So then, you'd say, okay, my feelings were hurt, so let me go to a small newspaper.  So you'd go to a small newspaper, some little small in North Carolina, some little small city.  And they like, oh, we love your stuff.  We really want you to come work for us, and so you feel good about yourself.  So then, you go back to like a Boston Globe or LA Times [Los Angeles Times], and get shot down again.  And I remember there was a long line--I was waiting for it--I don't know whether it was a LA Times or some large newspaper.  And I went across the hallway and it said, "St. Petersburg Times," and I looked in there.  There was nobody in that room interviewing.  And I saw a whole long line of people waiting, you know, and this other newspaper I was waiting for.  I said, you know what?  I think one of my fraternity brothers worked for "St. Petersburg Times."  I should go in there.  And I went in the room, introduced myself and talked.  And it was a result of that conversation that I got my first job opportunity--before, like I said, my roommate and I both majored in journalism, so and being two African American men and going through all the journalism classes together, working in newspapers.  We actually took over an African American newspaper at the University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky].  He was editor; I was like managing editor of the newspaper there.  So we covered all the African American community through our own newspaper, so that was really cool--recruiting students to write.  But our journalism career, they always called us, like the journalism brothers, you know.  And it's amazing that, in fact, we'll talk about that later, but he's my supervisor now.  He's the managing editor of the "Detroit News," and he hired me from the "Wall Street Journal," so and so, yeah.  It's like, it's still a connection that remains, but through all those battles, you know, I sort of saw that.  I really became connected and I preach today in these classes that, you know, for me, it was exceptional to just know what I wanted to do when I got into college because there were many of my friends who were sort of majoring in one thing, start off in engineering, float around in this, that, that today you really have to be focused because, you know, that four-year period is it.  So you need to not only take classes, but you need to figure out internships every summer.  You need, you know, you need to be smart with that time because it's such a competitive industry so.
Story_ID: 72045
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started off with the "St. Petersburg Times"?
Speaker 2: "St. Petersburg Times," I knew nothing about Florida, had never even, you know, been there.
Speaker 1: Well, I did do an internship one summer at Walt Disney World where I worked on the Davy Crockett Explorer Canoes and--
Speaker 2: That's on the other side of Florida, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly, in Orlando [Florida]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I worked along also parades, along with the Davy Crockett Explorer Canoes.  But I learned the whole Disney.  It was part of the Magic Kingdom College Program for the summer where you worked in attractions, and then you took classes related to Disney; either properties, entertainment, all during that whole period.  And that was a great experience for me, too, because it sort of taught me that once you enter the--sort of the Disney way of doing business, and that no matter what you were going through when you entered onto the Disney properties, and you--that you're on stage.  And then your job was to please the people who are your customers, which I think helped me sort of process and understand business even more because some of the principles I could use when I was--especially when I was doing business reporting.
Story_ID: 72046
Speaker 1: But I started at St. Petersburg [St. Petersburg Times] as a business reporter.  In fact, the summer before I started, I was interning at the "Detroit Free Press" here.  And that summer, I'd ended up getting a trip to Chicago [Illinois] to the Tribune [Chicago Tribune], and we kind of had a conversation with them, and they offered me a job.  And I remember saying, "Oh, I called my mentor," and I'm like, "Chicago Tribune offered me a job, you know, so what am I going to do?"  So they were like, "You don't want to go to cover what, you know, annual revenues or sales of some orange groves in Florida.  Come to Chicago, it's big time."  So I called my mentor, and I was like--Merv Aubespin [Mervin Aubespin], who is in Louisville.  And I said, "Merv, you know, Chicago Tribune offered me this job."  So, you know, he said, "And what'd you say--no?"  I said, "Well, I haven't said anything."  He said, "Well, you need to say no 'cause you already said yes to St. Petersburg Times."  And I'm thinking, but this is big time.  This is Chicago.  This is not like little St. Petersburg, Florida.  You know, he said, "No.  You made a commitment; you stick to it."  So that's what I did.  I decided I would call them.  I said no, Chicago, and went on and went to St. Petersburg in my '71 [1971] LTD, green, '71 [1971] LTD.  In fact, it was a--when--right before I graduated my car was sitting on the street.  And a trailer, a huge tractor trailer, like a--well, it was really like a RV came through this narrow street, ripped off my door.  So my father went to a junk yard and got me another door, but it was a different color.  It was like a light green door.  So anyway, I went down there.  And someone had once, in the western Louisville, too, I went roller skating when I was on vacation from college, someone stole the battery out of my car.  So my father got me a new battery, but he also bought me this huge chain to link--to chain up my hood with a padlock on it.  So with no air conditioner, I took everything I owned in life, put it in the trunk, and drove to Florida--
Speaker 2: (Unclear). (Simultaneous) for this experience, huge.  Yes, it had all kinds of dents and bangs all in the back and everything.  And my mother did give me a little air conditioning unit that I actually put--had a cover over it.  I didn't really--when I got there, I didn't have a place to stay.  I actually stayed in the Beach Park Motor Inn for about a month while I saved money in order for me to start to get a place.  And, in fact, there was a hurricane there, like my second, third week at work.  And I had never seen a hurricane before in my life.  They evacuated me out of the Beach Park Motor Inn.  So when people talk about, you know, they sort of see where you are.  They don't really understand all that you went through.  And it was, for me, St. Petersburg represents a lot.
Story_ID: 72047
Speaker 1: I mean, there was a significant shift in my life in a lot of ways.  Not only was sort of the first time I was completely away from family and friends.  I mean, it was a totally new beginning for me, where I had to meet new people.  I started, you know, in sort of my first job.  After all of this preparation, I'm here now.  It's time, it's show time.  But after I worked there about six months, I had a really difficult experience in that the business editor there, she and I just didn't click.  And she was, you know, very critical of what I could do.  And it was the hardest part in my life, as far as experience is concerned in this business, because it got to a point where she was so sort of frustrated and dismissive with me that she brought me in the room, in her office, and said that I should look for another job.  And I was devastated because she said that she didn't know whether journalism--I was cut out for journalism.  She said that and journalism might not be for me.  She said one day you might win the Pulitzer Prize.  She said, you know, but I think you need to work for a smaller newspaper and really think about journalism.  You need to get out of journalism.  And as I could tell, you know, as I talk to you, you see all that I did.  I mean, you know, journalism was something I prepared for me, and then it was crushing for me that was--I was so hurt.  I remember going to the phone at the YMCA that was next door to the "St. Pete Times" and calling that mentor, Merv Aubespin [Mervin Aubespin].  At that time, he had been one of the past presidents of the National Association of Black Journalists.  And I was in tears, and I was telling him what this woman told me and how I felt.  And he said--immediately he sent me to get some allies.  He said, "You got to have some allies in the newsroom."  And that's one thing I always praise the National Association of Black Journalists for us to have an organization where we can help and support one another as they're going through all these different things because, you know, the relationships matter.  And because he was President, he knew the current President.
Story_ID: 72048
Speaker 1: So, you know, there was some, you know, who do you know in Florida kind of things going on, but he knew a guy who worked for the evening paper.  At that time, it was--the "St. Petersburg Times" was a morning, but they did the "Evening Independent," and it was--he was like over the editorial section.  And he had, Vern Smith (ph.) was his assistant.  But this guy really helped me get my head together 'cause I was start--I was just--I was out of it, you know, but at the same time I was believing her.  I believed it when she said journalism may not be for me.  And all my hopes and dreams and everything just were shattered by this woman.  And I remember going--travelling every morning.  And then I talk about this in a lot of my speeches where I would listen to Diana Ross, "Goodmorning Heartache."  And I didn't have it, you know, in my '71 [1971] Hooptie.  I didn't have a stereo.  I just had a little cassette player, and I put it underneath my seat.  So even friends, when they would ride with me in my car, they'd say, where'd--where is that music coming from, you know?  And it came from under the seat.  I'd play it.  But I played "Goodmorning heartache, you all gloomy sight, you know, goodmorning heartache, thought I said goodbye last night.  I tossed and I turned until I thought you were gone but here you are with the dawn.  Stop haunting me now.  Can't make it no how, you know, these are Sunday blues.  These back, you know, Monday blues."  I--and I dealt with--every day, I mean, I went through that, listening to that, preparing myself mentally to face this woman.  And at the same time, my mother [Ruby Henderson], who, you know, I just explained to you, a very prayerful woman.  She's praying for that woman, and she would call me and say, "Is it getting any better?  I prayed for that woman so hard last night."  I know she couldn't sleep, you know.
Story_ID: 72049
Speaker 1: And it was really, really rough, but that's when, on the spiritual side, you know, that I, you know, sort of shut down and realized that if I didn't have this, what did I have?  And that's when I realized--I had always gone to church and grew up with the church as part of my life.  That's when God and I really got on one-to-one basis because I realized that at that time, I had put job first, you know, that was my everything.  So when I lost it, I almost lost me, but through, you know, my relation with the Lord and talking to Him about sort of where I was and how, I mean, I'm down here.  I don't have a family, you know, I don't have anybody's house to go over to.  I have no mom to cry to, you know.  I have no brothers and sisters.  I have, you know, work-related friends.  And, luckily, I had one who was really tight like a brother, but no one understands you when you're going through that kind of thing.  And I often say this in my speeches, too, that when you're doing well, you're, you know, you're surrounded by friends and supporters.  But, you know, get put back on probation like I did, you know, you'll see people run from you.  And no one wants to touch you 'cause it's like you're bad luck, or you got the, you know.  I don't want, you know, I don't want to go through what he's going through.  And so, it was some friends, you know, that I had met that kind of helped me, but it was just really--I mean, it was God and I, man--alone.  And I sort of, you know, re-shifted my thinking and I asked Him if that's basically what He wanted me to do.  And I became more comfortable, and through that spiritual relationship, I was able to get my head together enough to get kind of work together.
Story_ID: 72050
Speaker 1: And Merv Aubespin [Mervin Aubespin] who, at that time, I told you, had been the President of the National Association of Black Journalists.
Speaker 2: Can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 1: Merv, M-e-r-v, A-u-b-e-s-p-i-n, Mervin Aubespin.  He just--in fact, just retired from the Courier-Journal.  He called the President, the current President at that time, Al Fitzpatrick, who is a big Knight Ridder guy, African American, at Knight Ridder, and he was also President of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists].  And he knew the guy who was like the publisher of the St. Petersburg Times.  So they were able to talk to him, and this publisher was able to send a note and get me transferred from business news to neighborhoods.  And the neighborhood section is usually considered, you know, sort of like a second class entity in the newsroom.  You know, you have city desk and you have neighborhoods, but Greg Hamilton (ph.) was my editor in neighborhoods.  And this guy, you know, was so caring, when coming from that horrible experience.  And, you know, I still had a lot of great ideas, I thought, you know, but he helped me to sort of believe in myself again, and I started covering crack cocaine, in drugs, the drug culture, in all of south St. Petersburg [Florida], and I also started covering the African American community for the first time.  And that was a blessing for me, too, because, you know, I saw how rich our community was as a source of news stories.
Story_ID: 72051
Speaker 1: And I remember I did the series on crack cocaine and I just--and what it was doing to the lives of people, and how it was changing entire neighborhoods, and how I revealed in this one park where there was so much drug dealing going that, in fact, the city council, based on my story, ended up closing the park at dusk because kids were all around there.  And there was so much drug use that I really started to make a difference.  And I remember that, you know, that my editor said, I just went in the news meeting.  I told him, Greg [Hamilton] said, "We just got this little story that Angelo is doing on drugs."  Well, the series hit.  Man, it's some of the best journalism--even today, I can say as far as writing is concerned, it's tight.  The series today, I could read it and say, whoo, it was incredible.  But it gave--it was birthed in pain, you know what I mean, and recovery.  And so, my editor--so I got glowing reviews.  I mean, all my editors were right.  I mean, all the top editors from the paper were sending notes--great work, great work, and I finally got a note from the lady who was my editor, and my business editor, saying, you know, good work, you know.  But I wanted to make sure, and Merv [Mervin Aubespin]  always said, you know, leave when you're ready.  And so, I was at St. Pete Times a little over a year before I left.
Story_ID: 62042
Speaker 1: So, yes--so that St. Petersburg experience was life changing, like I said.  Not only did I learn about journalism, not only did I learn about struggle and defeat also, I learned about the ability, you know, to come back.  And I also learned about God on a one-on-one basis, that I never would have had those opportunities had I not experienced that.  Now, when I was going through it, though, I couldn't see any good in this whole thing.  It was just total, you know, hell, a nightmare, but it helped me because I sort of hit the rock bottom.  And from there, hey, there was only, you know, there was no way but up.  I mean, you know, I was--I believed that I was a failure.  I believed I wouldn't make in journalism.  All this time I wasted, I should have, you know, hey, became an insurance salesman like my high school predictions, you know, they had those high school, you know--
Speaker 2: They predicted you be in insurance?
Speaker 1: They predicted me to be an insurance salesman, you know.  And I was really upset about that 'cause, once again, you know, no one knows your future, you know, but God, so no matter what people think you may be.
Story_ID: 62043
Speaker 1: While you were going through that struggle at St. Petersburg [the "St. Petersburg Times"], did you ever think that maybe you were just in the wrong department?  I mean, all along, I mean that you were just in, you know, writing about business wasn't really your greatest contribution. (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Right.  I did it at "The Wall Street Journal," so that's what made me think, you know, I had the experience.  And then I worked at "The Herald Leader" covering business.  So, you know, I felt like they knew what they were getting.  I was green, true enough, but I had some experience, you know, but work with me.  He just graduated from college.  He, you know, he had, hopefully, you'd find some kind of merit.  But at some point, I could not do anything right.  And then I would seek counsel, even in that department, like one of the--there was an older lady who was, who wrote--was a business columnist.  She used to be the business editor.  But I went to her seeking counsel, you know, saying, can you read my stuff and tell me what you think.  Well, when this editor--her name is Susan Taylor Martin--I don't mind saying her name.  When she found out that I actually talked to the older lady, she reamed me, man, "Don't you ever go behind my back and talk to people."  I mean, for a kid, man, it was horrible; it was horrible.  But, you know, I could thank her today seriously because she--I needed to shift.  I didn't need to put that much faith in career, you know, I needed a different kind of focus.  I needed to have my spiritual relationship tight in order for everything else to work.  And had I not gone through that--I'm just so thankful because when I was going through it--when I came back, when I recovered, I thought about how many kids, black kids, never made it to that point, you know, who are discouraged and stopped.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, whose names you never hear about because they believed it and didn't have a support network to help them sort of regain confidence in themselves.  And that's sad, and I know it happens because it could have easily happened to me, you know, easily happen.  But I was just thankful, you know.  I was, like I said, you know, I had--I was with the church.  I always knew about God.  It's just that, you know, he and I weren't partners, you know.
Story_ID: 62044
Speaker 1: Did your behavior change any as a result of your spiritual experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, because, you know what, I decided at that point, I'm serious, I had nothing.  I had no self-esteem.  I was about to lose my job, you know.  I felt like, you know, my parents were always, you know, they always loved me, but I was a total disappointment, you know.  So at that point, I said, "God, whatever you want me to do.  I don't care what it is 'cause I can't, obviously, what I want to do, you know, it's not working."   So I said for a while, I've been going through like a three or four-week period where I said, I don't know what I'm going to do, you know.  And one of my friends, Glen Berkus (ph.), who is still a friend of mine today, he's a business editor at the "Charlotte Observer."  He would, you know, he'd keep tabs on me.  He was definitely one of my closer friends.  But he would say, you know, so how's it going, you know, what are you going to do?  And I'd tell them, "I don't know, man, I don't know."  I said, you know, "I'm totally quitting, you know, I'm just doing the God thing and getting directed."  So, yeah, for a while there, I was, you know, I was just--I cut relationships.  I just stopped doing anything.  I was just, you know, it was one of those dramatic times. But I know how people can lose themselves.  But the powerful thing about that is that you should never give the people the power to take you from, you know, to take you from you.  You've always got to believe in you when no one else does, when no matter what people say.  And I understand that now, especially in the spiritual sense that sometimes, you know, we sort of--we have a relationship with God and we understand, but we'll say, when the Bible says, "Eyes haven't seen," you know, "Ears haven't heard," what the Lord has for you.  Somehow we expect people to see the vision, you know, to understand our mission in life.  Well, heck, if the Bible says, you don't, your eyes haven't seen it, it hasn't even been created, you don't even know, so how can you expect others to believe that it can happen for you, you know.  And so that's why, you got to really, really believe and understand that this life is an adventure and you know, you got out of the driver's seat, sit in the passenger seat, you've got to stay alert, you got to do the work, but understand that, you know, your destiny is, you know, defined.  It's partly based on what--it's a lot based on what you do, but also, too, I mean, prayer and all that makes a difference without a doubt.
Story_ID: 62045
Speaker 1: Okay.  So where did you go from the "St. Petersburg Times"?
Speaker 2: I went to the "Courier Journal" to actually Merv Aubespin's [Mervin Aubespin] newspaper, and I got a job there on the business news desk, covered business again, and I had an editor, Sandra Doerr who was wonderful.  She was very supportive.  I covered--having covered the African American community in St. Petersburg [Florida], I still wanted to keep that part of my beat.  So I wanted to cover, you know, so I covered minority business, small business, and real estate and development, so I covered those arenas.  And working there was great.  It was a great learning tool.  They believed in me, you know.  I remember Sandra Doerr telling me that you're going to be the best business reporter there is, you know.  And then, so, you know, I mean I'd work for her night and day.  I'd wake up the morning, you know, go to work, stay at work 'till, you know, nine o'clock at night because I really believed that she believed that.  And I wanted to do everything within my power to make that possible.  So, you know, I worked hard and I developed a beat, you know, that's the first time I ever had a really-- a real beat like that, you know.  So, and then with real estate at that time, you know, I was writing about mortgage rates, a lot of complicated issues and development a lot.  Also, I did a series called "On Their Own," where I examined four business owners who--people who started in business.  And I looked at their first year of business, what it's like, and every three or four months, every quarter, I did a story.  And I started out with their dreams, like the first--I remember there was an African American couple who was starting out a package--a box franchise, where you sell, like--it's, like, almost like a "Mail Boxes Etc." kind of place.  And the woman, I remember Mai Lee (ph.) was something, like she was dreaming of a gold Volvo because she just knew, you know, business was going to be a--but at the end of the series, she ended up--they ended up going out of business.  But it trailed, you know, like two years later, I did another sort of recant, but I really spent quality time with them trying to get out of these individuals, you know, how owning a business, you know, impacts your life.  So I spent quality reporting time with them and so that helped me.  So--but I covered that, and I did that small business and minority business and real estate development for about--almost three-and-a-half years at the "Courier Journal" before I moved to the "Detroit News."  And, actually, my wife had worked at the "Courier Journal," Felicia Henderson.  At that time, she was a girlfriend.  She went through a journalism editing program at Berkeley [University of California-Berkeley, Berkeley, California].
Story_ID: 62046
Speaker 1: How did you all meet?
Speaker 2: Well, she--I told you about my friend, Everett, right, who was my college roommate.  Well, he interned at the "Courier Journal," the same summer that I interned at "The Wall Street Journal."  And he told me about this African American woman there who worked in the newsroom, and he was going to go to lunch with her, and that kind of thing.  So I knew her name, but I actually met her on a visit from my internship back home to Kentucky.  I met her just in passing and engaged, and we kind of spoke.  But the following summer, she went to the Black Journalist Convention in Baltimore [Maryland] and so did I.  And that was my summer right before I started my last internship, which was the Free Press, and also my first job.  And, so, we communicated; we talked a lot at the convention.  But it was the following convention, an NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] Convention in Dallas, Texas, where we really connected because we talked on the phone, you know, a lot before then.  And we were sort of friends, confidantes, and sort of in this business, sort of sharing stories about life, and also how men and women view life differently.  But we were sort of, you know, telephone friends, but we kind of connected a little bit in Dallas.  And from there, we sort of built on it, but at that time, she was working in Louisville [Kentucky].  And she was trying to get into an editing program at--it's part of the Maynard Institute out of Oakland [California].  And she was interested--she wanted to be a copy editor.  At that time, she was a clerk in Louisville.  So I came there as a business reporter.  She was a clerk and she wanted to do more, so she applied for that program and got accepted into it.  And she spent the summer studying editing and ended up getting an assignment in Cincinnati [Ohio] at the "Cincinnati Post," while I was still in Louisville, but Cincinnati is only an hour-and-a-half away.  In reality, she said we were engaged at that time.  We both agreed to say that, although, we weren't, so she wouldn't get, like, an assignment in California or some place, so we could be relatively close.  So we ended up getting engaged, though.  And like a year after that, we started--before we got married, because this business has such a strong nepotism policy at that time where, you know, you can't be married working for the same newspaper.  We sent out resumes and searched the world to try to find a market where we both could work in.  So she was, you know, she would leave Cincinnati, and I would leave Louisville and we would go to this place together and I tried, and my focus was so--I loved minority business so much, that I wanted to really make that the focus.  I realized when I was in Louisville that with the real estate stories and development stories, and so small business would always take sort of precedence over minority business because there's always sort of more news in those arenas.  So I wanted to find a newspaper where I could focus on minority business, so I called a lot of the urban centers; Cleveland [Ohio], Atlanta [Georgia], looking for a business editor who wanted someone to cover minority business specifically.  And when I talked to Detroit [The Detroit News], there was a business editor here, a Calvin Stovall at the time, who said he was looking for someone to cover minority business, so I came here and interviewed.  Felicia came with me, and she interviewed for the copy desk at that time, and we were both offered a job.  But I started in May, and she would start in October after we got married.  So we came to Detroit.  We got hired as singles and came here, although, the trade news didn't have a nepotism policy, we, you know, we still did it that way.  And she started here as a copy editor after we got married, and we moved to Detroit.  So that's how we got here to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 62047
Speaker 1: Now, how did you like Detroit [Michigan]?  Now, you were here once before as an intern?
Speaker 2: As an intern, which was an incredible city because as a, you know, I was an intern, but still I was working professional as an intern.  So I got to see a level of African Americans in the business community that was amazing.  I had interned the summer before, remember, in Cleveland [Ohio] at "The Wall Street Journal."  And at that time, that was the first time I was exposed to sort of this black professional life, 'cause they had the National Association of Engineers, for example, had boat rides.  And, you know, so you saw African American lawyers and judges, and so when I came to Detroit, it was much the same.  It was a larger black professional class, and I was really impressed by that, and I thought, wow, how cool.  I didn't, you know--and I really--so I never thought about actually coming back though, here to work, but I really liked the city for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had a lot of business to go--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh, in covering it to, right, oh, man, to cover minority business here, it was incredible.  You had, you know, African Americans owning steel processing companies, plastic companies.  You had, you know, we have more African American judges here than, like, lawyers than any other city, you know.  There's so many more than--or largest African American, you know, institutions here in Detroit than any other place in America.  So we're talking about entrepreneurs, because of the auto, largely because of the automotive industry.  There's huge numbers of African Americans who have started businesses and become major suppliers of the auto industry as related--because of the auto industry and really have become successful.  For example, we always, on the Black Enterprise 100 List, more of them are from the state of Michigan than any other state.  So it was an eye opener for me, and I was able to write about these companies, their strengths, their weaknesses, their comings, their goings, their development, so that really was an eye opener for me in this town.
Story_ID: 62048
Speaker 1: Who are some of the business people that are, you know, who stand out--
Speaker 2: Oh, I covered Don Barden.  At that time, he was a big cable operator here.  Now, he--I think he's the only African American to own a casino in Las Vegas [Nevada], and he has casinos in Gary, Indiana, and several other places--I think Memphis, Tennessee as well.  Dave Bing owned the Bing Steel now.  He has a whole complex where he partners with one of the big auto suppliers to develop, you know, auto parts.  William Pickard, who now has VITEC and also Regal Plastics, and a number of companies who supplies the automotive industry, a major player.  Ron Hall who, at one time, was a guy who was over at the Michigan Minority Business Development Council, which was sort of a networking group, has gone into business himself.  So there are just--I mean, and then the old school players like Ed Brazelton, who's owned a florist for twenty-five, thirty years in Detroit [Michigan] who, I remember, when I went to interview him for the first time, I came casually, you know, casual to his florist on West Grand Boulevard.  And it's like four doors down from the old Motown.  And he jumped in my case, man. He said, "Would you go to General Motors to see the President of General Motors without a tie on and a suit"?  I was like, whoa, you know, but once again, they taught me the game.  You know, they taught me, you know, that just because it's, you know, you need to come correct all the time.  And I learned a lot from them about covering them, the industries.  Like they say, whenever, you know, America catches a cold, you know, urban America catches pneumonia, it's the same way with business that when, once the industry suffers, African American entrepreneurs suffer the most.  I also learned about the other ethnic communities 'cause I covered minority business, so I learned about the Latino business community and became networked with them.  So it really, really was a good working knowledge base for me, sort of learning the city, as far as the players and oftentimes here people who are involved in business are also involved in politics so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 62049
Speaker 1: Who are some of those that are also involved in politics, and how do they connect up?
Speaker 2: Well, it's just that, you know, the business community ends up being a source of funding for a lot of political candidates.  So, you know, you meet sort of the main--the major attorneys, for example, oftentimes have clients who are the African American entrepreneurs, you know what I mean?  They're all integrated.  You see them involved in the churches.  I mean, they're--it's like it becomes a community, you know, that those are the profitable entrepreneurs.  They're more than likely, they're investing in other small businesses, be it, you know, services, you know, attorneys, accountants, so you meet black attorneys, black accountants, go to black churches, you know.  So it becomes a--go to a black social events, so the, you know, the fraternities and sororities, or UNCF, United Negro College Fund, you look at who are supporters of them.  You know, it's that kind of thing.  So you talk about African American car dealers, you know, Mel Farr [HM], another person I've covered before.  Nate Conyers [Nathan Conyers, HM], covered him when he just was Conyers Riverside Ford.  Those are the kind of players, but to watch them grow and develop and become, you know, to watch, to be a part, sort of witness that, and sort of document that in some parts was really good.
Story_ID: 62050
Speaker 1: But I worked at the Detroit News for--I'm losing track of time.  It was about three-and-a-half, four years.
Speaker 2: Now you started--when did you start with the "Detroit News"?
Speaker 1: In 1989--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I started with the "Detroit News."  And I left the "Detroit News" about like '95 [1995].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I left the "Detroit News," and moved to "The Wall Street Journal."
Speaker 2: It's about six years then-- (unclear).
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, it was about that, yeah, I worked at "The Wall Street Journal."  And I was actually recruited by "The Wall Street Journal."  The bureau chief there, [Robert] Bob Simonson (ph.), called around, and he said--he tells me this story, I don't know how true it is.  He said he called around and said, I'm looking for the best reporter, and your name kept coming up or something like that, but he called me.  And at that time, I was working as just a-- basically an enterprise reporter for the news, so I was covering all kinds of stuff.  I remember when the casinos opened, I went as an investigative reporter.  They didn't allow the media in on the day that the casino opened.  And I went in and called in the story from one of my interviews from inside the casino.  And I did all kind of creative stuff for the news.  I really had a great job here, sort of covering what I wanted to cover.  And so when "The Wall Street Journal" called, I wasn't really sure that was my connection because I was doing so much stuff here.  I moved from business desk to the city desk.  I had written a column in the business section called "Equal Access" with Tammy Joyner, so I'd done a lot.  So I wasn't sure--I remembered "The Wall Street Journal" as sort of being a little stodgy, you know, great writing, but I didn't know if the personality mix would be the same.  And at that time, you know, I had a pony tail, you know, so I was like, you know, it was--I was kind of, you know, visually a little different.  And--but I had lunch with the bureau chief here in Detroit, and we talked about story ideas. And one of the story ideas I told him I really, really wanted to write was about the wheelchairs, and how I had been going to the mall here in Detroit and noticed that on the second floor of the parking area, it was almost a waiting line to get a parking space because so many people are picking up people who are in wheelchairs.  And then I noticed going to the movie theater that, normally, there's one or two little slots for wheelchair users.  Well, they took out a whole row at the movie theater for just wheelchair users.  And I'm seeing it more and more in the mall--I'm like, what in--what's going on?  You know, is polio back or something?  But as I did more research talking to the individuals, I realized that African American men were the largest group--it was the growth area of wheelchair users.  And that and the growth was spawned by violence, primarily gunshot violence.  And the more I reported on it, the more I found out and I told him I wanted to explore sort of what's happening with this epidemic.  And he said, oh, he just loved that idea, you know, as a story.  So he said do you want to come work for me?  So I thought, you know, pony tail and all?  And he said, yeah, I want you.
Story_ID: 62051
Speaker 1: And so, I decided, hey, why not go work for "The Wall Street Journal," and I went over there, and the bureau focuses largely on the automotive industry here.  And I had never really covered the automotive industry at all.  So that was a whole new world for me, but at the same time, while I was learning cars, I was able to do the front page stories, like the wheelchair story.  And when I started reporting it there at "The Wall Street Journal," not only did I find out that African American men was sort of this growing epidemic, right, but I also learned that the wheelchair companies were responding to this industry by creating lightweight wheelchairs.  They were coming up with all kind of hip and cool colors; midnight blue, sky rocket red, you know, all these kind of cool things.  They had accessories that rivaled the car industry--backpacks, glow in the things for your wheels.  I mean, all kind of, you know, catchy slogans, like one was quickie, you know.  I'm a quickie and all this kind of stuff.  And they marketed them oftentimes in--because Medicare pays for them, these chairs, or Medicaid, in some cases, whatever.  And they market them in these urban rehab centers.  So, you know, if you, while you're in rehab, you learn to get your wheelchair, you try to decide which one you like.  Well, they have these wheelchairs as almost test models in there.  And, anyway, I unveiled this whole phenomenon, what's going on, and it was like my first front page story in "The Wall Street Journal."  And it really sort of helped establish sort of the lens that I see the world in, and the things I was able to sort of bring to "The Wall Street Journal" that separated me for the--from the other people there, so.
Story_ID: 62052
Speaker 1: I did that for about--and I was covering basically when I first started there, the non-U.S. auto makers, so I had--I remember having it taped on my file cabinet because there were so many companies, like twenty companies.  I mean, Fiat and Volvo and, at that time, it was just Daimler, not, you know, Daimler Benz, and Toyota Honda, and what made it even more challenging is that a lot of--most of the headquarters were not in the United States, so I had counterparts.  Other reporters who worked for "The Wall Street Journal," in like Bonn or in Tokyo, so we would collaborate on stories because the headquarters were in other places.  So I did that and wrote front page stories for about a year-and-a-half.  And then this bureau chief had decided to ask me if I wanted to cover Chrysler specifically and that would be one of the big three, which was major, so indeed I said yes, and I started covering Chrysler.  And I went through all the takeovers from the products, to the showroom, and I learned the executives.  I traveled with them, all the players.  Meanwhile, I still had a ponytail, you know, and I still was this, you know, that Angelo--but I was really able to learn a lot.  And I also learned the value of listening because I--you know, and I've learned that just through my journalism career, that it's important not to just talk, but to listen.  And that helped me a lot in persuading people to talk with me and share stories.  So I did that for about a year before the same bureau chief asked me if I wanted to be the deputy bureau chief there at "The Wall Street Journal," which would be the co-manager, the second in command of the bureau.  And I thought, hey, you know, this guy is treating me right so far, why not?
Story_ID: 62053
Speaker 1: And I did, and so I became--and at that time, I was like the only African American deputy bureau chief.  We had only had one, I think, bureau chief at that point, who had taken a job in New York.  So at that time, it was kind of hard because there was no other sort of African American colleagues I could talk to who had that kind of responsibility, you know.  But [Robert] Bob Simonson (ph.) really helped me as far as a mentor there--I mean, he was encouraging.  He taught me a lot about The Journal ["The Wall Street Journal"] and management, and that really worked out well, I thought, so I--
Speaker 2: Now, did your wife [Felicia Henderson] go with you to New York-- (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I stayed here.  I was in the Detroit Bureau.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Also, the Detroit Bureau, so you didn't have to go?
Speaker 1: I didn't have to go--
Speaker 2: Oh--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So she--yes, so she stayed here.  And she continued to rise up the ranks.  In fact now, she's feature's editor of the "Detroit News."  She has about thirty reporters here that cover entertainment and features, all that.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--Right here.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I was able to stay here and do that.  And what happened eventually, I ended up being offered a job as a page one writer for "The Wall Street Journal" where I would write exclusively for Page 1.
Story_ID: 62054
Speaker 1: And I took that job, and there was, you know, there's some, there was enough, there were some people around, you know, who said, who is this guy who, you know, he could get, who could write for Page 1?  But by that time, I'd done a number of Page 1 stories.  One called "Hair Wars" where I did the story on this huge Detroit phenomenon where they have these hair fashion shows, and all the stylists are like warriors, you know, designers, and they compete and they--it's like Detroit [Michigan] against California, and Detroit against Atlanta [Georgia].  So this is the story on hair wars.  I did a story on church fans.  One time I was at church, and I noticed that more and more, instead of funeral homes--on the back of the church fans, you'd see auto companies.  You'd see Coca Cola.  You'd see all kind of different companies now sort of on the back of these church vans.  And so I realized that companies found a way, a new way to market themselves, and that's to go after that church fan market. And I looked at how funeral homes were responding.  This was their niche, you know, how is funeral homes--now, how do they feel with, you know, corporate America entering their arena?
Story_ID: 62055
Speaker 1: So "The Wall Street Journal," you know, really liked that story, too, so I was able to bring more and more stories to The Journal.  I did a story about African American funeral homes.  I was learning that at that time, there were, you know, the small white funeral homes were being purchased by conglomerates.  And what happened was they would operate--they would keep on the management team, you know, and they would work, it's almost like glorified managers.  And you would never know that this funeral home was no longer locally owned.  Well, it started to happen with African American companies--funeral homes.  The rumor was that, you know, this, you know, small African American funeral home is owned by white people, you know. So I started following this trend, and there was actually African American conglomerates, venture capitalists, that were buying up these African American firms.  And the fear was that they were going to get them all neatly together, and then one major white company could go in and buy all the black funeral homes and wipe out an entire industry.  So I wrote about that as well so--
Speaker 2: Is that a real fear?  I mean--
Speaker 1: Oh, it was real fear--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) --based on real or--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) --real, because, yeah, there was a firm out of Chicago [Illinois] that had up to like--I don't know, twenty or more funeral homes all over the country.  And, you know, and it was a fear because African Americans--small African American funeral homes, wouldn't sell--had issues about selling to whites, but they would sell to this black venture capital firm, not recognizing that venture capital is about making money.  And after they got so many, they could sell them and, you know, and one signature, all of them could be gone.  So I--
Speaker 2: This is serious business, too--
Speaker 1: Oh, serious business.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) --in the black community, and it's probably true in Detroit [Michigan].  I'm sure it's true in a lot of places, but the number one business in a lot of, especially small communities, is the funeral home.  The funeral home is a place where the politicians emerge from.
Speaker 1: Exactly--
Speaker 2: And the ministers and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) --source of wealth, source of income, source of pride, a lot of generational monies.  But a lot of these older funeral home directors have kids who don't want to go be in the funeral home business anymore.  They want to do other things, so they don't have anyone to pass it down to.  And, at the same time, the requirements-- and I explored this in the story, too.  When you're a funeral home owner, you don't get a break.  Every time somebody dies, they want you there, not an assistant.  You know you got to be there.  So the demands are really high.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that was, you know, that was leading into the idea, they wanted to get out of business, so I mean they wanted to do something with it, and they could cash out this way.
Story_ID: 72052
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  We were talking about the funeral homes.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, the funeral homes.  And they were such an important part, a sort of a cultural tie and it meant so much to the community.  And then there was so much history, as it relates to how the Civil Rights Movement sometimes, some of the leaders were taken out of areas where they were endangered in hearses, you know, under cover.  And I learned all about the history, the same way like the church fan story.  I learned that that dated back to Africa where the fan was used by some (unclear) goddess to pass blessings.  So while we think the church fan, 'cause I kept thinking, why do we even have those church fans because churches are air conditioned today.  You don't need, you know, why do we have them, which made, you know, and I'm realizing that--
Speaker 1: Well some are.
Speaker 2: --some are, all right, but some are, right. But even in an air conditioned church, you still have those church fans.  And I'm like, you know, I don't understand.  And white churches don't have them.
Speaker 1: You know, and I've never realized that.  It's probably true--(simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: But, right, it's true.  And so and that's, I mean, that's why I say it's a blessing 'cause I mean, you know, I see the world differently.  And the Journal [Wall Street Journal] really understood how different--the different way, the different story ideas, you know, that I came across, and how I see the world.  It really felt like it was such a valuable difference that I could really contribute to the newspaper.
Story_ID: 72053
Speaker 1: I did a story about how there's this growing number of African American entrepreneurs, who have decided, forget managing race, you know.  I'm just going to hire white people in the right places.  And no one ever has to know that I own the company.  So I found a catering firm here who--First Impressions--who they actually have--
Speaker 2: That's the name of it?
Speaker 1: First Impressions.
Speaker 2: That fits right into the story doesn't it?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: First Impressions.
Speaker 1: First Impressions, and when she actually started, she would change your voice, squeeze her nose, and change her voice like she was a receptionist, you know.  But if you were to contract with her business, a white guy would come out with the sales brochure and a book with photographs from all the various catering events, and the white people carving hams, and whites at the door in tuxedos, you know.   And if you hired her firm, you know, they'll be ninety percent black people who would appear at your doorstep, you know.  And there at the time, too, Lavan Hawkins owned--he owns all the Pizza Hut franchises here.  Or in the urban markets, he actually has a franchise throughout all the metro area--I think even the state.  But in Detroit, the Afrocentric stores, he's got red, black, and green flags outside, Lavan Hawkins, you know.  But the whites, out in the white markets, he had a white counterpart that he used to go and make presentations to the local Jaycees and that sort of thing.  The same way with, at that time, Mel Farr [HM], and you know, in Detroit, he flew around with a cape in Detroit--Mel Farr to the rescue, you know.  He's Mel Farr.  Well, in the Fairfield, Ohio, he had a white guy who was in a cape and said, "Mel Farr to the rescue."  So he never said that was Mel Farr, but he never didn't either, you know.  So it was just an interesting way how some people have found a way to manage around race--
Story_ID: 72054
Speaker 1: --And I wrote that story.  I also did a story about kidnapping, and how urban kidnappings are on the rise.  I did that right before I left.  I did that about a year ago and how many people--lots of people in urban areas are getting kidnapped; cousins and brothers and sisters and mothers, as a result of drug deals, drug dealers, or in and around that kind of thing, so--
Speaker 2: Kidnapped and held for ransom?
Speaker 1: Ransom.
Speaker 2: For--
Speaker 1: And I actually documented where, like, this one guy was taken from a record store.  They called his house.  The girlfriend wanted $10,000--wanted, like, first of all, I think something like $50,000, and then it got down to $10,000.  The girlfriend and the mother dropped off $10,000 in a brown paper sack, dropped it off at the Church's Chicken.  And the kidnappers picked it up--I mean, but all these kidnappings happen all over the place.  So I did that like a year ago.
Speaker 2: They seem to be making--I haven't heard about that.  There was one in Chicago [Illinois] last year that made the news, but is this like a big thing in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 1: It's a big--no, it's all the country, it's happening.  But what happens is people come up missing and they don't know why.  It'll be on the news--so and so is missing.  So that's what I kept thinking.  The more I did the story, I say, you know, it says so and so, you know, hasn't been seen in two days.  I'm thinking, I wonder if it's drug-related, or if it's part of this kidnapping phenomenon.  And now what's interesting--
Speaker 2: Well they can't--can they tell the media about, I mean, do they tell the police about it?
Speaker 1: No, they can't.  Sometimes they can't tell police.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And sometimes they can't tell police and that's part of the complication in this, 'cause it has to sort of, it's sort of like this street code ethics, A--
Speaker 2: And you don't want the police in it anyway--
Speaker 1: You don't want the police in it if it's--
Speaker 2: --if it's drug-related.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  And, B, you don't want even your peers to know, 'cause if somebody knows they snatched your mother and you paid, that means somebody else could snatch your mother, you know, or your child.  So you don't want to punk out and look like that, too, so it's this whole thing going on.  So I wrote about that.  So those are the kind of things I do.  That's, you know, I sort of discover sort of new worlds.
Story_ID: 72055
Speaker 1: And that's what I attempt to do and--
Speaker 2: Are these--let's just go back to that for a second.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I know the case in Chicago [Illinois] that hit the news last year was a school teacher that disappeared--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and she was later discovered in a trunk of a car.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, they kill them sometimes, too.
Speaker 2: And because a ransom was not paid--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --and later found out that she was involved in this drug thing herself.
Speaker 1: Sometimes, right.
Speaker 2: And a respectable school teacher who taught many years in the Chicago Public School system, are these the kind of people that are--
Speaker 1: Sometimes--
Speaker 2: --really want to be--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and you wouldn't suspect as being involved in--
Speaker 1: Some of them are like that, like the teacher you described, and then in other cases, there are people who are just innocent relatives--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --of those who are.  And that's why my story was sending the message that now you have to be, you need to be very careful, you know.  It used to be, you know, you could take that color--that new DVD player and that new television from, you know, little Ray-Ray (ph.).  You know Ray-Ray didn't have a job, you know.  But, yet, you know, you accepted the suit that he bought for you.  Just understand that when you do that, you're accepting a lot of other things.
Speaker 2: Umm.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So it's got a long arm that can reach right up in your family, and pull somebody out.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This drug picture.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And so, that's why it's really interesting today watching all these abductions that's going on because I do think that sort, you know, I've been blessed to have some kind of, you know, some discerning spirits, you know, to be able to see some things sometimes and I--some of these kidnappings that you see are similar.  Kidnappings are not just--some of them are because somebody didn't pay somebody else.
Speaker 2: Umm.
Speaker 1: You know, but they can't get into that on TV.  You just want--I just want you to know that my daughter's missing, you know what I mean?  So stories behind the stories.
Story_ID: 72056
Speaker 1: So and I ended up writing for Page 1 as it was--they really wanted me to, you know, to do that.  And so, like I was explaining, that there was some people who said, you know, who is this guy, you know, and how can he just write for Page 1 of "The Wall Street Journal"?  But at that time, Ken Wells (ph.) was my direct editor and John Brecher (ph.) was his editor, was the Page 1 editor.  And they, throughout my whole career at "The Wall Street Journal," really believed in me, and always loved all my ideas.  So I was really comfortable in working straight for Page 1, so I would work out of Detroit, though, the way I arranged it.  I would just report directly to New York [New York City, New York] from Detroit [Michigan] and write, you know, the kind of stories that I do. So it was, maybe, it's like five or six months later after getting that job when I learned that one of my stories had been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize.  And I learned it through--it's amazing enough, Glen Berkins (ph.), who I mentioned to you who worked in Florida with me.  He worked for "The Wall Street Journal" in Washington, DC, and he had overheard that they, you know, sent a bunch of contributions, submissions for "The Wall Street Journal."  And he said they included one of your stories.  I was like, "Really?"  You know, I was on the telephone.  I said, "Are you serious?"  He said, "Yeah, man, they just said that one of Angelo's stories is one of the nominees."  So I immediately called Ken Wells, my direct editor, and said, "Is it true what Glen told me?"  And Ken is like a brother to (unclear), I mean, 'cause he's my direct editor, and he really feels my story.  He feels the passion.  He knows how to, you know, it's, as a team, I mean, I've never worked with anybody as an editor like him.  But he said, "Yeah, it's true, you know, we sent your stuff in."  I said, "Well, you know, some people I know who won the Pulitzer, they always have two or three stories.  I mean, do you need some more stuff from me?"  And he's like, naw, he said, it's just this one.  He said, you know, and remember, it's a dark horse, you know, in that there's a bunch of, you know, competitors, and just--but just understand that we're saying that this is the best work that was done at "The Wall Street Journal."  And he said, you know, you should be totally satisfied and excited about that.  And I said, "Oh, I am," you know.  So I'm like, "Oh, that's great."  So I really didn't--I mean, I never thought about it after, you know, sort of after that.  But then I started hearing rumors, like somebody would call and say, because you're never really told how the process, the Pulitzer process works.  But I would get a call and say, Angelo, you know, you made it to the next round, the next cut, you know, your story did.  And I'm like, but you never could, you know, you can't figure it out.  I mean, you don't know.  It's all speculation.  Then I'd hear sometimes on my phone, oh Angelo, you didn't make it.  They maybe got down to the finals and you didn't make it.  And I'm like, oh, well, you know, then I hear oh, man, no, you're in, you're in, so it was a trip 'cause it's like-
Speaker 2: Oh, like a whirlwind.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, I mean, you can't ask anybody 'cause no one is supposed to be revealing any information 'cause all these juries are done in private, you know.
Story_ID: 72057
Speaker 1: So you really don't know how you're faring.  And even up until the day of the announcement, there had been experiences, especially at "The Wall Street Journal," a guy who won the feature writing, the first feature writing Pulitzer Prize for "The Wall Street Journal."  He was in another category, like exemplary journalism or another category, and what happens is sometimes, when they're competitive, real, real great pieces in, like, investigative reporting, they'll take, they'll keep one as a winner, and they'll put one in feature writing.  And none of the three finalists in feature writing will win.  See what I mean, they just bounce them out because feature writing is such an open, you know, they can kind of use that, while it's great writing and that, they can use others and, you know, and if something weighs out, you know, so you never know, even at the end, whether you make it or not.  Or, and now when I went to lunch with my editors, they were saying, you know, we understand you're a finalist that day, but, you know, something could happen easily because it's happened before, you know.  Here this guy is looking for his name on Pulitzer and it doesn't even appear and, you know, exemplary journalism and feature writing, there he is.  So I was prepared.  And then, once again, they told me, you know, just, you know, just to make it to this point.  So my wife [Felicia Henderson] and I, we know we were in New York for the day of the Pulitzer announcement, and we were in the office, in Page 1 and the names, they announced it for Columbia University [New York City, New York], and the names were coming over the computer, different winners.  And it said, "Angelo Henderson, feature writing," you know, "The Wall Street Journal," and everybody is screaming.  We're all screaming.  And champagne was coming out from all, you know, every direction, and it was just incredible.  It was an incredible experience.
Speaker 2: Kind of like the Super Bowl--
Speaker 1: It was, it was.  In journalism it is, it's our Oscars, you know, it's like (unclear), you know.  So, yeah, that was my moment, feeling like Denzel [Washington] and Halle Berry, you know.  It was crazy.  It was just--I mean, unimaginable.  It was crazy, and I remember, you know, I had to get on this table, you know, give a speech or whatever.  And I just remembered--and I remember to this day saying that, you know, when I leave church, there's this benediction that says, "Now, unto Him, who is able to do exceedingly and abundantly above all," then, you know, that you can ask or think.  And I remembered saying that I always wondered what that was like, you know, abundantly above all, you know, more than you can think, you know, what kind of, you know.  And I said today, I had that kind of blessing, you know, that it is 'cause I never really--I never pictured winning a Pulitzer Prize.  I mean, that's something that all journalists would, ideally, like to win, but it's not like something I was working toward.  Like I'm going to write a world Pulitzer Prize winning story, you know, and, you know, I just, you know, did a story and it just--
Speaker 2: And it bounces back to acquit your business editor in St. Petersburg, maybe, like she said you might win the--
Speaker 1: I know, isn't that ironic, in that--this is God, man, it's just God.
Speaker 2: But you're not, you're not made for--
Speaker 1: And it's just God, man, to have that kind of, you know, prediction.  And, you know, when she said that, you talking about going over my head, but I never--I mean, I didn't never thought that was a reality.  I mean, like I said, I didn't even think the business that I believed her, that it's amazing.  It's just amazing how life can be and then when you asked me, what is one of your key words?  Amazing, amazing.  It's true, it is true.
Story_ID: 72058
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, can you tell us what the story was about?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, what was the story about that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: The story looked at--well, basically, I had a thought in my mind, an idea of what it's like, what is it like to kill someone?  What does it do to you?  How does it change you?  How does it--how do you talk about it?  Do you--can you watch cops, you know, on television?  I mean, does it give you the like heebie-jeebies or something like that?  Can you not sleep at night?  And I always had that, like, I have a lot of questions like that in my mind, just wondering, just ideas.  Well, when I worked for the News [Detroit News], I did this story on small business and crime.  And, really, what I did was I found an area that was experiencing crime for the first time.  All right.  And I profiled this community in depth.  It was about twenty-something businesses.  And I talked about how each business was changing their operation to deal with crime.  So they were putting up plexiglass windows for the first time, installing buzzers for the first time.  And, in fact, one of the merchants on one of the corners ran an athletic store.  And some guys had come in and robbed this woman, tied her up, and put her in the closet.  Okay.  And these robbers operated the store, the cash register, and everything for like an hour, you know, before they left.  Is that not incredible?  But, anyway, one of the business sites--
Speaker 1: They need more money to--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, and that just--it was just bizarre.  Well, one of these stories was about this pharmacy--was, what this pharmacy who had got--this pharmacist got robbed.  But I wrote the story, but he was one of many businesses.  Well, it was about four years later when I was working at "The Wall Street Journal" that I noticed in a brief that a pharmacist had shot and killed a suspecting robber.  And all it gave--it didn't give any names, but it gave an address, which reminded me--that address reminded me of that story that I did.  And I wondered if it was the same pharmacist.  Because I was so familiar with the area, I couldn't think of any other pharmacy around there.  So I pulled, and I went back to my files and found the barber shop that was next door to the pharmacy, and called them and reminded Paul, you know, from Paul's Barber Shop, who I was and asked him if that was the pharmacy that--and he said yes, it was.  I said, "Was it the same guy I interviewed, Dennis?"  He said, yes, it was.  So I called the pharmacist and, believe it or not, Dennis was there.  And I asked if he remembered me from my days at, you know, I told him that I worked at "The Wall Street Journal," and did he remember me from the Detroit News days, and he said, yeah, he did.
Story_ID: 72059
Speaker 1: And I told him that I know you might not be that comfortable for you to talk right now, you know, about what happened.  And he said, you know, he really was giving me the vibe that it wasn't.  But I told him, when you're ready to talk, please let me know because that I think that you've experienced something that a lot of people--that there's other people who are in business, who only--can't even imagine what it's like to go through what you, you know, having shot and killed someone.  So I said, "If you don't mind, I'll check back with you periodically."  I said, "This is not like I'm trying to write for next week, you know, I'm just going, I'll check back with you."  Well, what I did was I talked with him every, like, two or three weeks, you know, and either I'd call him on the phone, or I'd stop by and visit him.  And we were really able to establish a relationship.  I was able to learn about him and his business, you know, and sort of what happened.  I would take some notes sometimes.  Sometimes I really would just have a conversation.  But I really, I mean, it wasn't until, like, late, later in that fall--this is January, okay.  It really wasn't until, like, August, September that I went in and physically sat him down and took notes about what happened.  But I got bits and pieces of the story, you know, just, you know, so sort of what it was like for him that day to step over the body, you know, what he did with the gun when, after he realized he had killed someone, you know, and how it changed him.  And it was so hard for me to find out about the guy that he shot.  I went all over the place looking for information.  I went to about ten, twelve different neighborhoods, tried to find out about this guy, in all these places where he was, where his addresses were listed were--it looked almost like crack-addicted, crack houses almost, you know, real rough neighborhoods.  And I ended up--I had practically given up on the guy that he shot 'cause I couldn't find any information about him.  And that's when I decided to write the story without the guy, just, you know, just the pharmacist shooting.
Speaker 2: Now, explain who the pharmacist is?
Speaker 1: The pharmacist was a white guy, and the guy he shot was African American but, uh--
Speaker 2: The pharmacist was an older guy, too?
Speaker 1: Older guy, a real older guy.  And what, I mentioned, and some people immediately think race.  But in my reporting, I found out that the guy, the robber, actually approached the African American woman who was at the cash register, the assistant who worked there, with a gun, and said, you know, give me your money kind of thing.  So it's just that the pharmacist just happened to be--watch and see that his employee was being held at gun point.  Well, she was trying to drop dollars to get his attention.  And he finally noticed and came over.  And that's when the guns were drawn, you know, the robber pulled a gun, and then the pharmacist pulled a gun and shot him.  And, you know, right there.  But in this, though, I couldn't find anything about, you know, the guy who was killed.  And I decided to write the story with just the pharmacist part, and that's what I did.  I talked to my editor in Detroit, and we sent the story to New York.  And New York really thought it was a compelling story because it really talked about how such a serious incident can change your life.
Story_ID: 72060
Speaker 1: But my editor there, Ken Wells, said, we don't know how to, how sorry to feel for the guy who died.  So I ended up parachuting into Chicago [Illinois].  What happened was, really, I went back, found a police officer who is in the Detroit Police Department, who was new to the job.  And I spoke at some seminar for Council of Mayors or something in Michigan.  And she came up to me afterwards and she said if I ever, ever need your help, I mean, if I can ever help you, so I was--I happened to have this request.  I really need some more information on this guy.  So she was able to get for me enough information so I could get a death certificate.  And when I got a death certificate, I found out that the guy lived in Chicago, that his mother was from Chicago, and that he was buried in Chicago.  So it gave me the name of a funeral home.  So, from there, I parachuted into Chicago.  In fact, I always call to see what an area is like, when I'm traveling around the country.  It's tough enough, and I have to say this in speeches, covering your own zones, you know, your own tough neighborhoods, but to go to places that you're not that familiar with, but I called one of my friends who's an attorney here and asked him about this neighborhood.  And he said it was over by the United Center in Chicago.  And he said, it's known as "the zone", and when he said that, man, my heart went to my shoes, you know, recognizing how difficult it is, you know, to get to and from, you know, especially when you're not familiar with people and places.  But--
Speaker 2: It's like Henry Horner Homes?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, this was like an apartment building close there, close to, you know, in those neighborhoods.  But I was able to take--I was able to go there, and I actually went to the funeral home, first, to try to get information.  And the lady there was, she was almost helping me, and she was telling me that she was going to get ready to give me the information, his obituary, she found his file and everything.  And just as she was about to give it to me, a guy, who was sitting across from her, said, you think you should be giving that to a reporter?  And I was, like, man, you know, I was like so close, you know, and here I am, I'm talking, this is like September.  I've been working on the story for a whole year without this piece.  And here I am, like, within arm's distance.  And so, she did give me the obituary, though, which was the first time I could actually see his face, and sort of see his story in print.  And I realized that I had missed a lot because it said he had, you know, a wife and all this stuff.  And I thought, oh, my God, I'm so glad that I was able to come here to figure it out. And I went to the graveyard in the meantime just to get--take notes on where the guy was buried.  And I did that, and while I was there, I talked to the graveyard office, the office at the graveyard, to find out if something happens to this grave, you know, how would you--who would you contact?  And anyway, they gave me an address.  So I took that address back to the funeral home and I said, well, can you at least confirm this?  Can you say whether it's right or not?  And they said that, indeed, it was confirmed that it was right.
Story_ID: 72061
Speaker 1: And so I went there and knocked on the door--well, actually went up to the house, and the guy and asked--told him I wanted to try to find the parents of this guy.  And the stepfather was there, and so he talked to me.  I went upstairs for a couple of hours, and then I end up talking to the mother when she came home from work for about three hours or so.  And I was able to learn when his older brother came in, yeah, came into the scene and sat down and started sharing with his mom in front of me about how his brother was actually a drug dealer, had been a drug dealer for years, and had a nickname, Yo Roller (ph.).  And he revealed that for the first time in front of his mom and his--
Speaker 2: She never--
Speaker 1: --she never knew.  And she was just blown away as he was sharing this whole life about her son, that she never knew, and it all unfolded right there in front of me.  And I said, it's too oftentimes that there's no reason that this should have happened in front of a stranger.  You know, here I am from "The Wall Street Journal" sitting there in their kitchen.  And this secret, this family secret, is being told in front of me, you know, and that's why I say that it was just God, you know.  I said what's-- this was God's reward for all the misery and strife I had been through in the journalism business, that God was saying, okay, here's a little something to reward you for all your efforts and all your endurance and all your work because when that unfolded, it was as if I disappeared and I tried to write it like that, too.  So you could feel the shock and the surprise and the disappointment in learning about this.  And it also said something about her.  It showed her that, look, this is a family that cares enough about its mother that it wouldn't want to hurt her, that having a son who's a drug dealer, would hurt her.  So we'd rather keep her from that, you know, so it said a lot, you know.  And I worry about this business' images sometimes.  And I think that, you know, that some people could say, oh, a stereotypical white guy killed a black guy who was a drug dealer, but I think there was some other messages.  I put in there about how both his mom and stepmom were about to retire from their jobs in Chicago, you know.  I put in there how in the reporting, how, you know, his favorite foods, you know, what he liked to eat, you know, and the sense of family.  And I think, as African American journalists, you know, we do care about images in our community.  And we do, we are--we have to be responsible, and that's why I thought it was important that race, that in my reporting, I make sure race was not a factor, you know.  And I watched the pharmacist's interaction with so many black people.  The African American who, like, delivered, like, the UPS guy, and some different suppliers.  You know what I'm saying?  He talked with them, you know, watching how he interfaced with the African American woman who worked for him.  Race was not an issue.  It was a robbery was the motive, you know. But--
Speaker 2: Now, this pharmacist was robbed before, you said about the--
Speaker 1: He had been robbed a couple of years before, exactly.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And that's why he started carrying a gun.
Speaker 2: In the story, he's, like, totally helpless.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: He's got a gun on him, and they're telling him what to do--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and there's nothing he can do.  He doesn't know if he's going to live or die.
Speaker 1: Right.  He's laying, right, with his face down, and he saw his whole life come before him.  And it was that vulnerability at that point where he decided after that experience, he would start carrying a gun.  And he revealed to me that once you start carrying a gun, using it is second because what happens is once you start carrying it, you have these dress rehearsals in your mind about when you might use it.  So when it happens, it's almost like something coming, and like that you've already imagined, you know, which I thought was kind of interesting, too, and very thought-provoking.  So, but, yeah, the story explored the lives of those two individuals, and how they changed when they met in the crossroads of that pharmacy.  And you can get it on wwww.pulitzer.org, 1999 feature writing, and you can read that story.
Story_ID: 72062
Speaker 1: How did the pharmacist feel after he pulled the trigger--
Speaker 2: He was upset because he really never knew much about the guy.  In fact, I taught him a lot in my reporting about the guy, but he--you never know when you're going to have to deal with it again.  And when I was writing the story, I wanted to show the everlasting sort of effect that such a thing has, you know, on a person.  I mean, that you, that it's going to always be with you.  Then I explained how a teenager came in with a baby into the pharmacy one day and asked, is this the place where the guy was shot.  And the pharmacist said, yes, it was here.  And he said, she said, I just wanted to--she said, thanks, I just wanted to know who killed my baby's daddy.  And she turned up and left.  And here he is, shaking, you know what I mean?  He wanted to say, you know, all these things, you know, I didn't mean to do it.  I didn't want to do it.  I wish I didn't--you know, you think, could I have done something else, you know what I mean?  But you live with it.  That is one of those decisions that you can't fix.  And like he said, he knew he didn't--it wasn't malicious, and he knew he didn't have a choice with the guy, but still, it's not an easy thing, and it's going to be something that remains with you.
Story_ID: 72063
Speaker 1: And so that's how I ended the piece so--
Speaker 2: How did you feel?  I guess there's the knowing that on some level, you had the--without your interaction in it, there wouldn't be so much information about it for the pharmacist or the family or anything.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean, you're in a position in a sense where you can pull the whole story together--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --for people--(simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: --oh, that's true.
Speaker 2: And that's what you're doing.  That's a--but, how do you feel about that?
Speaker 1: It's a--I mean, it's a very powerful tool.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And I think that we could teach a lot because I think you can learn a lot about people and life in situations.  And I really do believe that journalism is a way to change the world, at least to inform, you know, and I think that providing information just once again sort of teaches people about life and living.  And I hope to be a guide through that experience and be able to document some of those incidents, you know, where people feel some way, you know--hurt, healed, hopeful, energized, motivated, or changed.
Story_ID: 62068
Speaker 1: [OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 2: Yeah, what happens?  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, it's life changing in reality.  I travel a lot, speaking in business conferences, colleges and universities, journalism schools, professional associations, dinners and banquets.  One of the profiles written about me, it was told to me that I guess that I am the twenty-second African American to win the Pulitzer Prize since its inception.  And I think there's just been one other since the time that I won--I guess the African American woman who wrote "TopDog," the Broadway production.  But as a result of that, the demand is pretty high in that people really want to hear from you.  So it gives you a chance to really speak about journalism or life experiences to really kind of--and I use it really as a way to inspire people to say, look, you know, there was a time in my life when I didn't believe in me, whether it's a business group, in some cases I talk about using "The Wall Street Journal" experience, the business of living, and how life can take you through ups and downs.  So, right, but I travel a lot.  I do a lot of speeches all over the place, and so that's the main thing.  It sort of thrusted me into this whole world, limelight world, that I had not been accustomed to, but--
Speaker 2: Well, that was 1999, right, and--
Speaker 1: I actually won it, right, I won in '99 [1999], right.  And it was like, for the--you know, definitely, so it's been what--few years now.
Speaker 2: But it's still rolling along so--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, twenty-two, I mean, you know, and since inception, so it's not like, you know, we win, unfortunately, every year.  I mean, you know, every year, you're rooting for at least one brother or sister to walk away with the prize.  And it doesn't happen, you know, it doesn't happen.  So I'm grateful and feel blessed that I have, but as a result of that, though, try to get out and really try to trumpet and say, you know, whatever your dreams are, you, too, can achieve them so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 62069
Speaker 1: Did you feel at the time when you heard that that story was selected that that was your best story?
Speaker 2: I knew, from a reporting standpoint, it was by far the most challenging because there was so many hurdles and, you know, I only really talked about a few of them, that all that sort of roadblocks that I reached.  And I also realized how compelling that moment was, with the mother and the son, that it definitely ranked up there as, from a reporting and a writing challenge, definitely.  But I felt passionate about everything I've written, and I'm like that, you know.  Every story that I really try to do my best, and try to really, you know, make it the kind of story that it can be.  So I wouldn't say any more effort went into that than any other story, or any more passion, but it was more difficult, I think, reporting wise, definitely, than some of my other pieces.  I mean, getting African Americans who make it their business to use whites as fronts basically are asking them, and "The Wall Street Journal" is asking them to tell the world that they use them, you know what I mean, so, therefore, that strategy goes out the window.  I mean, that's hard to do, too, you know.  It's hard for African American firms who are considering being bought out--funeral homes to be considered bought out by whites, to go on the record and say, I might sell to a white person, you know what I mean.  It's, I mean, oftentimes, I find myself in these situations where it's not easy, you know, getting people to talk about what you want them to talk about, but, you know, I just said, thank God for grace to be able to give me the personality skills to kind of help them understand why it's important to share the story.
Story_ID: 62070
Speaker 1: Do you ever get negative feedback from a subject of a story when they see it in print and they get upset that--(simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: I've had those throughout my career.  I've had that, but--and sometimes a ramification, you know, you hear that people, you know, might not like it but, largely, I don't really get a lot of negative feedback, you know, and, like I said, I try to make sure there's no surprises.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Like everybody knows what I'm writing.  At the end, every--all of my subjects know what's there, what's not there, so you're not shocked by what you see, you know what I mean?  So I try--I definitely like to talk to the pharmacist about everything I knew about the guy.  So I said, you're going to read in the newspaper that he did this, that his brother had been to your pharmacy before because one of his fears was retribution, you know, that somebody may come back and shoot me.  But the brother told me he had actually broken parole and been to Michigan, and went to this pharmacy.  So I explained, you know, I explained to him everything that I knew.
Story_ID: 62071
Speaker 1: Did the brother go there after the shooting?  At time of the shooting, he went there to the pharmacy.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And that was one of the weird things in the Pulitzer stories that the pharmacist--one of his major issues was retribution, you know.  Would somebody come back and try to shoot me or kill me because they don't understand why I did what I did?  And there were times when he talked about this that it was so real, and I tried to when I report, to report from the inside.  I want to be able to think like you do when I'm writing about you.  I want to think like you do.  I want to see what you see.  I want to smell what you smell.  I want to appreciate what you appreciate.  So understanding that, and understanding I had this hat on, right, and he's sharing this with me. There was one time when he said, you know, Angelo, you know somebody could come through this door right now and just blow me away.  Man, I was sitting there, I was like, okay, maybe God's trying to tell me that, you know, get in my car and get out of here, you know.  But that was real.  But when I was reporting it, I found out that this brother said he broke parole.  First, he had named all these jails he had been in.  Then he broke parole and actually went to the pharmacy.  He said, oh, it's a little small place.  I thought to myself, that guy would just die if he knew that, you know what I mean, 'cause that was his big fear.  But somehow he never knew that that had occurred, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, but he went there, but he didn't know that was the pharmacy that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No.  And he assumed, and the family thought that it was something related to the girlfriend of their, you know, of their loved one--not, they didn't believe that he had robbed the place so, you know, it was all this misunderstandings about really what happened.  But it was good that there was--
Speaker 1: They didn't really know.  They really didn't have an understanding of what happened.
Speaker 2: Right.  So there was--they wouldn't want to believe it.  So it was good that that interaction never occurred, but, you know, it was real close, it was real close.
Story_ID: 62072
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's (unclear).  So when I left "The Wall Street Journal" in December and moved to the "Detroit News" and here, at the "Detroit News," I'm a special projects reporter.  I'm working on a major piece right now.  Unfortunately, I can't reveal what it's about.  But, once again, it's getting into the lives of people, and it involves a death.  And I'm kind of putting pieces together of lives who were impacted, so it's interesting, you know.  Once again, I'm having to use a lot of those same skills.  But now, I work--my boss is--direct supervisor is Everett Mitchell, who is the managing editor of the "Detroit News," the first African American manager and managing editor of the "Detroit News."  And he was the same college roommate that I talked about, same fraternity brother, and everything that I talked about from back in the day.  So we're able to--the journalism brothers are, you know, back together again.
Story_ID: 62073
Speaker 1: Good, good.  Now, you--do you think you'll be here for a while?
Speaker 2: I'm thinking, at this point, yeah.  I mean, I'm pretty committed to Detroit.  I've been here for about 13 years at this point.  And at the same time, I do some other things, like I co-host a radio talk show "Inside Detroit" with Mildred Gaddis (ph.) in the mornings, which is on 1200 AM.  I do that from 6:30 to 10, Monday through Friday and a--
Speaker 1: What's the name of your show?
Speaker 2: It's called "Inside Detroit," and the key host is Mildred Gaddis and I'm her co-host.  And we talk about relationships; we talk about current events, politics.  We go the gamut, and it's a largely African American audience.  It's a call-and-talk show, very interactive.  So we have--we tackle a lot of issues, not just in Detroit, but also nationally.  So that's pretty substantial--it takes quite a bit of time, you know, and like I said, from 6:30 in the morning 'till 10:00.  And because of where I live, I have to travel, it takes me a while.  I have to get up at 4:00 in the morning, 4:15 in the morning, to do that, so then I leave the radio station, and come to the "Detroit News" and do my job here.  And so, it makes for a long day.
Story_ID: 62074
Speaker 1: And I'm still working on a couple of book projects, too, that I'm trying to get in place.  I have an African American woman, Denise Stinson, who's working with me, a literary agent, who's one of the best in the entire industry, who's trying to keep me motivated, so I can try to do some--write this book.  I have actually two ideas I'm working on so--
Speaker 2: Are they fiction or non-fiction (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well, one is really based on my St. Petersburg experience.  It's sort of the idea of building yourself coming back, getting yourself back after experiencing something like that.  In fact, Denise Stinson has a religious arm called Walk Worthy Books, spiritual side, spiritual part, so that's what I'm writing for.  And the other one is really--it's more of "Travels with Charley" kind of piece where I take this thing, and I travel across the country and then look it through the eyes of different individuals.  So that is so--and both of them, they're really sort of more reality pieces than not.
Story_ID: 62075
Speaker 1: So I have that, in addition to, you know, being a Deacon at Hartford Memorial Baptist Church that--
Speaker 2: Hartford Memorial?
Speaker 1: Hartford Memorial Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 1: H-a-r-t-f-o-r-d, Memorial Baptist Church.  And also, too, I just graduated from the Ecumenical Theological Seminary here in Detroit in Urban Ministry, earning a diploma in Urban Ministry, so that was a three-year program for me, you know.  And now I finished that, so I'm able to incorporate some of the ministry stuff now into sort of my speeches.  And I'm almost getting some new church assignments.  So they say, won't you come here and preach or something like that.  So that's a whole new venue for me.
Story_ID: 62076
Speaker 1: Do you see yourself becoming a pastor one day really?
Speaker 2: I don't know; I don't see that.  I took-- look, I say all the time that, you know, I got to have an Abraham experience of God face-to-face thing before I think about doing anything like pastoring.  That's not something that I'd want to do, but, you know, I didn't want to do this thing anyway at all so, you know, you never know where you may end up.
Speaker 1: Did the seminary change your perception of religion at all?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, it helped me appreciate the differences that people have, and also, like, theology helped me to understand that you can't always reach people, you know.  You can't make God--if God is truly God, then don't put Him in a box, you know.  Don't think that the only way others can relate to Him is the way you relate to Him.  Like I remember, it's a powerful--one of my professors, she battled with alcoholism.  And just as a woman in the ministry, and this is a largely African American program, this Urban Ministry program.  She talked about how difficult it is, you know, for women in ministry, period, because of the, you know, the battles of the sexes that happens in the church, you know, it's a black male thing, you know, largely.  And she was explaining, though, when you're trying to minister to a woman, why do we always say, he's your Father?  What if you're trying to minister to a woman who was raped by her father, or beat by your father, or, you know, or has always had a horrible and hurtful male figures in their life?  Why would you present God like that?  If God is indeed a spirit, why do you have to make Him a he, you know, which is cool, which, you know, enlightened me a whole bunch, you know.  And a part of it is understanding that this journey is so personal.  And it's so based on relationships that, you know, how, you know, my wife and I get along, you know, no one knows, you know what I mean, but it works.  Same way with your relationship with God, you know, it's personal.  So you-- what you try to do is make the connection, and then you let them figure out, you know, the relationship.  You just lead Him to them, call it a day so-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 62077
Speaker 1: So if--did your parents, though, see you become successful?  Are they still alive?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Roger Lee Henderson] died in 1997 and that was, you know, that's the first time someone in my inner circle, and that was really rough for me because he didn't get to see a lot of the things that--he didn't see me own a house, buy a house, you know, he got to meet my son.  I have an eight-year-old son, now Grant, who is about, you know, basically about two then, but he didn't get to see me win the Pulitzer Prize, you know, but my mother did.  My mother [Ruby Henderson] is still alive.  She lives in Louisville, Kentucky, and she's my number one fan, you know, so she's always encouraging me.  I remember part of winning the Pulitzer, after you win, "The Wall Street Journal" has something called, like a Pulitzer luncheon--a Pulitzer dinner for the award winner, so you get to invite, you know, a few people.  So I flew my mom in from Kentucky into Manhattan [New York City, New York] for the dinner.  My sister and my niece came from California.  And when I met my mom, I brought--got like a limo to come pick her up from the airport.  And her plane came in late, but when I was there in the airport in Newark [New Jersey] waiting for her, as the plane was debarking, you know, and the people were getting off, right, everyone was walking off the plane saying, congratulations, congratulations, oh, you--
Speaker 1: She told everybody?
Speaker 2: I was like, oh, my God, my mother has been at work, and she's like that.  I mean, she's, you know, like I said, she carries stuff in her purse and magazine articles and newspaper articles and, you know, she keeps those.  She always--she told me the other day, I was at the bank and I was in line, and she said, I didn't have anything to read, but she said, you know that, that program they did on you at the University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky] when you were a speaker a few months ago, I pulled that out and I read while--you have to love her, you have to love her.
Story_ID: 62078
Speaker 1: Yes, indeed.  What do you--now, this is a question we normally ask people, and you're the youngest I've ever seen, but what do you--what would you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Well, I do believe that we're here on a mission.  And I often say that I believe jobs are assignments, our spiritual assignments that God puts you in a place for a season for a purpose.  You know, at this point, I don't think that winning the Pulitzer Prize was the end for me, you know.  I really feel like there's several other things that I'm meant to do here in life.  And I think that was just to give me the audience that I needed to say the things that I need to say.  But at this point, I just, you know, I want to help people with their lives.  And I think I'm able to do that by motivating them, you know, and inspiring them and offering the encouraging word.  And I think that, you know, I know it's not me.  You know, I know that, you know, that it takes work and effort, but, you know, at the same time, it's attitude, you know, it's how you treat people.  It's respecting yourself and others.  It's believing in you, sometimes when no one believes in you.  And it's also having a spiritual connection; having, you know, God in your life that those things will help you manage life.  And I think that for now, whenever I speak, I try to share that.  And I'm so encouraged by people who say they're encouraged by that, either they're in the workplace and they're having a difficult time, or they're facing some difficulty where somebody said they can't, and now they believe in themselves.  So if I can say I left here, my legacy is helping people manage life, you know, and using God as the ultimate management tool.  I think that would be my legacy.  That's what I would hope it would be.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you got a lot of time left, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As someone with a heart, a writer with a heart.  A human with a heart, you know, a person with a heart.
Story_ID: 62079
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't touched upon today that you think you'd like to address before we close?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think that--well, you know, my wife [Felicia Henderson] just plays an important part.  Family is a very important part for me.  Like I said, I have a son, Grant, who's eight years old.  My wife is a features editor here at the News the "Detroit News", and I'm only able to do--sometimes, I mean, when I talk about waking up to 4:00 in the morning, but sometimes I don't come home until like 11:30 at night.  I have extremely long days.  And I told you I also sing with a group, Marc Ivory & Excelled Praise singers.  The other last--I guess it was Thursday night.  For example, it was a regular week for me, so I was up at 4:00; downtown at 6; on the air at 6:30; finished that at 10; worked the Detroit News from 10 until 7; did another radio program from 8 to 9; had to sing at the Gospel Workshop of America, which was here in Detroit [Michigan] at 10:30; didn't get out of there until almost 1:00 in the morning.  Now, I'm doing a lot, but I couldn't do a lot if I didn't have a partner who is able to help me, you know.  Not only help me physically, but spiritually, but also help me manage home.  And I could depend on my wife to help me manage, 'cause when I'm traveling a lot, you know, I have responsibilities, like today, before I could come here, I had to make lunch, you know.  When I leave here, I have to go to pick up my son from the tutor, and take him to the racquet club, you know.  So I'm, you know--and my wife told me when I came back to this interview that he's watching the clock.  So I know I have to answer to him as soon as I get there.
Story_ID: 62080
Speaker 1: But it's, you know, it's like having a balance in life really, really is important to me, and it can't be all work, you know.  It can't be any all one thing that, you know, having some God, family, work, all in its right dimensions really makes it happen.  So that's, you know--but she, you know, she really allows me, in order to be here.  And also, I also have really good friends that are--that I really feel like care about me, you know, and spiritually support me, you know, like Aaron Smith (ph.) and Calvin (ph.) Pierce and Ramona Chapman (ph.), I could just go to Laresse (ph.) Stokes--I mean, people who I know that call me and say, how are you doing, you know, who say you need to get some rest.  That's always a common thing.  You need to take vitamins now, you know, Keisha (ph.) Esterwood (ph.), she's like on this vitamin kick, you need to take some vitamins.  And I think that being surrounded by people who look out for you is also very, very important.  And I do.  I'm blessed to have a tight core of friends who I really feel like have my best interests at heart.
Speaker 2: That's wonderful.
Story_ID: 62081
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, we, you know, these are some tough times for us.  We're looking at, you know, we hear the numbers on statistics on fatherless homes, you know.  And I know, as a father, how tough it is to raise one son with two people.  I mean, you know, you--I mean, constantly, you're trying to play tag, you know, to get this done or get this, you know, get him there or to, you know, sometimes you know, somebody's tired, and you got to help with homework and, you know, to manage their, you know, one child's life, it's crazy for us with, as two parents, and then, financially, all the costs.  I can't imagine what it's like, you know, to just be a single parent, you know.  And so I, you know, I pray for these women who are doing it and succeeding and doing well--better in some cases than some, you know, two-parent homes.  But, nevertheless, it's a challenge, you know, that somehow we have to figure out ways to provide more mentors for our kids, so they could-- because if I didn't see it, I wouldn't have necessarily believed that I could achieve.  I mean, I saw Max Robinson on television.  That was one person who I, you know, I thought of as a journalist.  And that's when I said, hmm, you know, he's pretty cool.  I like him.  And I realized, you know, that they don't really get the story always right in our neighborhood, you know, what you see it on TV, they get part of the story.  I'm thinking, I could, you know, but seeing him made a difference.  So one of my hopes is that, and I encourage people throughout the country to take our children to the people you want them to see.  You know, we always want to bring them in the school.  Let them go to the workplaces.  Let them see them in action.  Let them ask questions because, you know, when people see others, they can kind of dream.  And I just think that we have to instill hope and dream back into our community.  And we have to expose them from--so they can see that the world is bigger than what they--and some of what they see every day.  Also, too, I think that we--I'm worried about the disconnect between classes because it used to be that in our communities, you know, it was the, you know, that classy lady down the street, you know, but they, you know, it was all different economic levels.  Now, that's not the case.  It's the have and it's the have-nots, and I believe that schism is getting larger.
Speaker 1: And they don't live in the same little neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Don't live in the same neighborhoods.  Kids don't go to the same schools.  They don't go to the same churches, you know, anymore.  It's really becoming a class difference, and I think that's something consciously that we, as a community, have to figure out ways to connect better because what we don't want to do is be so disconnected from one another that skin color is the only thing that keep us in common.  And I think that's the next bow that we have to, have to attack, and figure out ways to work together, to overcome.

Speaker 1: I also think, too, this whole young men in prison issue, you know, figuring out, not only how to keep brothers from going to prison, but also how to help them when they come out.  You know, the numbers are so great now that we have to find a way to reconnect them with the world.  And reconnect them with family and reconnect them with those things and get them back, put our arms back around them, and figure out a way to make them whole again.  And until we do that, we're going to be missing a segment, so we have some challenges facing us, but we have a long history, you know.  We've always survived under stress.  It's always, you know, been impossible.  How can slavery--how can they make it, you know, the middle passage?  They won't survive, but we do, we survive.  We not only survive, we succeed, and we will, and we will.  We just have to remember one another because I think it's in our collective strength and energy that we'll be able to make it.  You know somebody, you call me.  You need something, I know somebody who can help you.  And we're able to sort of depend on each other to make it all connect.  And in the end, you know, we'll make it, we'll make it.

Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Oh, no problem.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I addressed it a little bit--just the idea of business ownership.  Ownership is going to be also a key part of our success or survival.  I think entrepreneurship is one of the ways of gaining wealth in our communities.  You can always work for somebody, owning.  And when you own a company, you employ.  You also determine market needs.  People say oftentimes in our communities, there's nothing in our communities, but cash checking places, party stores, you know, liquor stores.  But until we learn the value of real estate in developing land, then we can maybe put some of the things in our community that we think need to be there.  So I think ownership, business ownership is going to be key and having covered minority business, I understand the value of having African Americans in business, profitable businesses, succeeding business, and what that cash infusion and sensitivity can do for our community, as well.  So I think that is also where one of our hopes lie without a doubt, and increasing the number of African American entrepreneurs.
