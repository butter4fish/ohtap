Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type, lightweight questions that we always ask that only require a short answer. They're kind of a warm up, and management makes me do this.  So, (laughter) the first quest- question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know (laughter).  I eat what my wife [HistoryMaker Verna Holley] provides.
Speaker 1: And that's your favorite at--
Speaker 2: That's my favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Probably lavender or a shade of purple.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I love the summer, mainly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, although I did enjoy a visit we made to Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or a saying?
Speaker 2: I have so many of them.  "Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against God" [Psalm 119:11].
Story_ID: 612602
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Major Holley, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: All right. Ethel Lee Jones [Ethel Jones Holley], E-T-H-E-L, L-E-E, J-O-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, Holley?  Holley is her last--I mean--
Speaker 2: Yes. (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is 22, June, 1896.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Born in a rural community outside of Greensboro, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, Greensboro.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace her, her side of the family?
Speaker 2: The great-grandfather's name was Pharris Collins and his wife, Julia Collins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they both were born in the 1850s.
Speaker 1: So they were both born during slavery?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about the, the slave experience that are passed down on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not, not directly.  On the Jones side, there is.  And of course, the obvious, the story is the female was the cook, and slave master fathered the Jones.
Speaker 1: So he fathered children by your--would this be your--
Speaker 2: Be the great.
Speaker 1: Your great-grandmother or great-great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: No.  It would be the great-grandmother on the Jones side.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Her father's name was Alfred Jones, and his [sic. her] grandfather was Wiley, W-I-L-E-Y, Jones [Wiley Jones].
Speaker 1: Okay, the Jones sides, side is your maternal side, or, or the--yeah.
Speaker 2: That would be the paternal side.
Speaker 1: Okay, the paternal side of your mother's family.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, and of that generation, okay.  So, so the plant- was the plantation run by a guy, somebody named Jones?  Is that--
Speaker 2: I assume that they--
Speaker 1: Or, or the fa- or this place--
Speaker 2: I assume they were slave movers, because that part of Alabama is just, you know, scrub lumber primarily now.  So I suspect that it was the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, anything else, else about now--okay, so they go back to the 1850s.  Are there any stories about Civil War or Reconstruction that come down?
Speaker 2: Well, Wiley Jones is an interesting person because of the, the ability--because of his father he was able to buy property in Hale County [Alabama], in Greene County [Alabama].  And well, the most interesting story about him was when he died.  My cousin took him to the doctor.  And as it was custom, black people were not treated by doctors in their office.  And he had had a massive heart attack.  And so my cousin, Herbert Jones [ph.], was insistent that the doctor should come to see what he could do for him.  When he got to the car, he had already passed away.  And so the doctor asked him what funeral home did he want him to go to.  And when Herbert mentioned the name of the, the funeral home, the doctor knew immediately that it was a black funeral home, and he looked kind of aghast, only because Wiley Jones did not appear to be a black man.  And of course, it was always told in a humorous manner.
Story_ID: 612603
Speaker 1: What about your grandparents on that side?
Speaker 2: I did not know them as a small boy, with the exception of when the, when my grand- when my mother's grandmother [Roana Jones] passed away, my mother [Ethel Jones Holley] took my youngest sister [Thelma Holley] and I down on the train--that was my first train ride--to go to the funeral.  And that's when I had my first exposure to Mason Dixon Line and as a four year old there, not knowing and wondered why we changed the train.  We had to get off the train, walk the length of it up to the front and get back on.  And, and of course, my mother explained to, to me why that happened in Cincinnati [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, so Cincinnati was the place where you had to change--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --over before you crossed into Kentucky.
Speaker 2: Before--yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1937 or so?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were four years old. Okay.  But even at four, you could, you could appreciate the differences?
Speaker 2: I didn't know the whys un- until my mother explained to me, you know, 'cause riding a train was quite an experience, for the first part of the trip.  And we--you know, since we were so small, we wondered why, why, why can't we just walk through the train.  They're all connected, you know--didn't know (laughter).
Story_ID: 612604
Speaker 1: So you didn't have much contact with your grandparents at all?
Speaker 2: The grandparents on my mother's side, my mother's mother [Mary Collins Jones], passed away the year after I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did not really--I can't say that I knew her.  I thought I did.  But as it turned out, it was another aunt who I remembered, not knowing that it was not my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew, of course, the grandfather [Alfred Jones], you know, had already passed away.  I met my father's father [William Holley] only once, and that was in 1938.  Again, I was a little boy, so I didn't know much about him--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but he looked like my father [Major Holley, Sr.].
Story_ID: 612605
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna get to your father's [Major Holley, Sr.] side in a minute (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: But now, now your mother [Ethel Jones Holley], then, she, she grew up in--did, did she grow up out, out, outside of Greensboro [Alabama] then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did she say about growing up there?  What was it like when she was com- coming up for her?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it--there were some difficulties, but they were, you know, a rural family.  And again, things revolved around her mother's connection to the A.M.E. Zion Church [Walls Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church, Greensboro, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay. (Pause) Okay, A.M.E. Zion Church, all right.  So what, what was the name of that church?  You, you know, or--
Speaker 2: Hill Zion [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now, did, were her people farmers?  I would guess--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, mostly farmers.  And did they own their own, own land, or were they sharecroppers?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was that land as a result of the purchases of the, of the people who related to the white land--I mean--
Speaker 2: It, it may be in part.  I, I don't know that as a fact.  But--
Speaker 1: Was there a story about how they acquired land, I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, the Jones side, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, it's more of a story there, because my mother was--'til the grandparents died.  She was deeded forty acres, which she maintained, paying the taxes all of the years of her life.  And of course, by that time, we had sixty-four or more descendants.  So we thought it wise then to transfer it over to the Jones side of the family.  And, and my cousin, Herbert [Herbert Jones (ph.)], you know, purchased it.
Story_ID: 612606
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Ethel Jones Holley] have a chance to go to school down there?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  At that time it was, you know, a regular what was public school, country school, and then later to one of the industrial schools in the Greensboro [Alabama] area.
Speaker 1: Now was that analogous to a high school or a junior college or what?
Speaker 2: It would be more of a junior--
Speaker 1: Like a junior college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A junior high school.
Speaker 1: Junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know they--sometimes those names, you know, there are a lot of industrial schools, and then you have normal schools at the--
Speaker 2: Well, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at the college where--
Speaker 2: --that's what it was.  It was a normal and industrial school.
Speaker 1: Okay, well you--
Speaker 2: But at her age--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, she would have been thirteen, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Well, usually a normal or industrial school is like a junior college, a two year, and you--
Speaker 2: Well, we--
Speaker 1: --and you come out and you can teach and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, and of course, that's what she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when she talked about it, you know, it was, it was really more a mid-high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, not even the full high school, you're saying.  That--not even the full high school, but--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, okay, but she did graduate from the, the industrial school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is the name of it?  Did it have a--
Speaker 2: It was Greensboro.
Speaker 1: Greensboro industrial school?
Speaker 2: Normal and industrial.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right, so, now did she--well, well, we'll, we'll leave her right here, maybe go, go to your father's [Major Holley, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 612607
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Major Quincy Holley [Major Holley, Sr.], M-A-J-O-R, Q-U-I-N-C-Y, H-O-L-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind the name Major Quincy Holley?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Actually, my, my older siblings will say it's Major Quincy Adams Holley--Major per- perhaps because of the rank in the Civil War, and then Quincy Adams because of presidents [President John Quincy Adams] who were influential in helping to raise the status of black people in this country.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so it had some significance.  Now, now was he ever in the service himself (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  He registered for the draft in Detroit [Michigan].  He came to Detroit in 1915 and probably was recruited by some of the factories who needed workers leading up to the First World War [World War I, WWI].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let me--what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is 11, July, 1895.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born outside of Selma, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now have you been to, been to Selma?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We still have one branch of the family--my, my grandmother was a Purdie [Sophia Purdie], and so one branch of the family is still in Selma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wondered if you, you remember Major Grumbles eatery in Selma.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: There's one called Major Grumbles, named for a Confederate major [William Edmondson Jones] who urged his men to stop--there was a, a group of freedmen who were heading to Selma, you know, and ahead of the Union Army.  And they were--they said, "We have to stop these, these colored folks, you know, before they tear up--," you know, so, he urged the men to go out and stop them.  And they said, "Are you coming, Major?"  And he said, says, "No."  He said, "I, I got children at home and stuff."  So he, he was sitting on his horse backwards with a jug in his hand when he said it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There's, the drawing on the restaurant is of a man sitting on a horse backwards with a jug in his hand, this is Major Grumbles, you know.  But this is--I don't know.  He was a major from Selma, so I don't know.  You know--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --just thought I'd throw that out there.
Story_ID: 612608
Speaker 1: So Major Quincy Adams Holley [Holley's father, Major Holley, Sr.], and so what do you know about the ancestors on his side?  How far back can you trace them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, his father [William Holley], I, I have not been able to find a great deal about him.  He and my grandmother did not stay together.  I'm not even sure they were married.  And in searching for the family, took me a long time to find him because the name changed.  But I finally was able to find him in the, the, you know, 1900 census and along with my grandmother and one of her siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories on that side of the family about life down in--Selma's [Selma, Alabama] an interesting part of the South now; I don't know. (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, there, there is quite a, a number of stories.  I went to a family reunion in 1991.  And as soon as one of the elder members of the family saw me, he called me by my father's middle name and took me around, you know, to the different places, the church and where they baptized folks, took me to the family cemetery, and he showed me around.  It was inter- interesting family.  And we had traveled down from Detroit [Michigan] to Selma in a car.  All of us--at that time my youngest sister [Thelma Holley], who was born in 1938, she was not, she had not been born yet, but all of the rest were in that car.  And my daddy had a 1937 Ford, and every one of us (laughter), all nine, were in that car.  And, and of course, I remember John Lloyd Purdie [ph.] was the family that we were going to see, 'cause they still lived on the family land.
Speaker 1: And Purdie, that's the, that's your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) P-U-R-D-I-E.
Speaker 1: D-I-E, okay.
Speaker 2: They are originally from Bladen County, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, my grandmother's name was Sophie Purdie [Sophia Purdie].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, any, any stories about these relatives? What did they do for a living and where they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It depends on which one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: It is interesting because of the, the number of siblings altogether.  In North Carolina they were on the land of John Wesley Purdie at the end of the Civil War.  I was able to find them through an agricultural schedule that showed all of the family members, the, the cows and the pigs and the chickens they had on that census.
Speaker 1: Okay.  John Wesley Purdie sounds like a fine Methodist name, named for John Wesley.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Yes?
Speaker 2: --and there is a church called Purdie M.E. Church [Purdie United Methodist Church] in Hollow Township, Bladen County.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, there was a plantation.  It was on the Cape Fear River.  And although we were not able to reach it, we did see some of the Purdie family members at another--at, at that church.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the famous Cape Fear River.  There's a couple of movies named Cape Fear (laughter), melodramatic movies.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, they left North Carolina, and we have not been able to know the reason for it.  But the oldest sibling at that time is the family from which John Lloyd Purdie comes from.
Story_ID: 612609
Speaker 1: Now you've done quite a bit of genealogical research.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is it, is it--now, so you, you really have charted this family, you know, back to 19th century, right?
Speaker 2: Back to 1824 is--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the, the farthest I've been able to go, because I haven't been able to nail down in the slave schedules, you know, exactly the great-grandfather and great-grandmother.  But I believe they were both together because of the names of the slaveholder families.  There was a Purdie; there was a Smith, and Ms. Smith [Annie Smith] married Mr. Purdie [James Purdie].  And I believe that their slaves were combined together.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you can trace the Purdies back to 1820--
Speaker 2: Eighteen twenty-four [1824].
Speaker 1: Eighteen twenty-four [1824], okay.
Speaker 2: That is, that is the black Purdies.  The whites were there in the mid-1700s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--okay.  So is it difficult to, to, to do that?  You know, a lot of people have tried, try to do that these days, and--
Speaker 2: It is, it is very difficult if you don't have access to plantation records or books.  Just recently a friend was in Durham [North Carolina] and went to University of North Carolina library on, on that campus [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  And she was able to confirm for me the name of the manager of the plantation.  And I knew the name, but I couldn't put it together with the Purdie family, and now I, I have.  So that would be one of the next steps, to go back and look to see what other things are in the collection.
Speaker 1: And has it been anything remarkable or surprising that's been of interest to you since you've been doing genealogical research on your family?
Speaker 2: I'm always surprised by the wills, the way wills are written.  They give allegiance and loyalty to their eternal savior and then start enumerating property.  And that was difficult for me at, at first.  It would anger me to think, here's a person identified with the church and hoping for eternal salvation and then were able to turn their heads and list property.
Speaker 1: List human beings as property (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Human beings.
Speaker 1: So you're talking about the, the--
Speaker 2: Only as property.
Speaker 1: So you're, you're kind of moved by the hypocrisy of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --slave--
Speaker 2: Yes, and, and was--
Speaker 1: --masters--
Speaker 2: --a struggle at first.
Speaker 1: --in those days.
Speaker 2: But now I, I, I've gotten past that.
Speaker 1: So you wondered how, how someone who professes to be a Christian can be a slave--
Speaker 2: How loyal--
Speaker 1: --owner.
Speaker 2: --is, is that relationship when you don't have misgivings about it?  And part of it I realize is a part of the training that I had as a young child and into adulthood.  But you can forgive a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did you suspect these people were not sincere Christians?
Speaker 2: I think they had compartmentalized themselves from my people as property.  They were just like a horse or cow.
Speaker 1: Do you think these individuals will go to heaven?
Speaker 2: That's not my call (laughter).
Speaker 1: I just wondered, you know, you know, what you might think.
Speaker 2: I think there's, there's many surprises that await a lot of people.  With, with the Nelson Singers [Earl Nelson Singers], we sing everybody talking about heaven ain't going there, and I believe that.
Story_ID: 612610
Speaker 1: So, well, tell us about your--now, now your father [Major Holley, Sr.], did, did he talk about growing up and what it was like?
Speaker 2: I never had the opportunity to talk to my father.  We--he was not a, where he would be conversant, you know, with me.  I could--and, and it may be our personalities.  We're both different.  Mine is like my mother's [Ethel Jones Holley].  My dad was a very proud man, almost bordering on arrogant.  And he would tell you, "If I were you, I would do thus," and so on.  But I wasn't that way, and so it was always a struggle as I was growing up.  So there were questions I couldn't, I, I didn't feel free to ask him.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But my [paternal] grandmother [Sophia Purdie] did tell me, you know, when I was a little boy.  That's how I knew where to look in North Carolina, although I had to look all over the whole state, you know, I mean as far as Bladen County [North Carolina] was concerned.  But I, I was able to find the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so do, do you have any clue from other relatives what, what growing up was like for your father?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can we pause a second?
Story_ID: 612611
Speaker 1: Really didn't get a sense how your father [Major Holley, Sr.] grew up, or--
Speaker 2: Well, from my mother [Ethel Jones Holley] I did.  He was evidently very industrious and worked well with his hands in designing things.  So when he came to Detroit [Michigan], he became a molder, where he would have to make the molds for hood ornaments, and door handles, trunk handles, things of that sort.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I guess some designer would design it, and what, he would cast them?  He, he would make the mold to cast (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He would make the sand mold for them to pour the metal into.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and he, he was quite skilled that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and later, you know, we--he had a house, the original house had no basement.  He worked out, figured out who he had to get to build a basement, raised the house.  And you know, that, that's a memory that I have of watching him.  Oh, like I said, he was a very proud man, arrogant.  He would always tell us that he was a walking encyclopedia.  And if you asked him a question, he always knew the answer.
Story_ID: 612612
Speaker 1: Did he [Holley's father, Major Holley, Sr.] go, go far in school?
Speaker 2: He went to what was called Selma University [Selma, Alabama].  It still exists.  Of course, it's difficult to, to know the level of, of courses, you know, that he may have taken.
Speaker 1: Now, one thing I know about Selma [Alabama], from having spent a little time there at the anniversary of the march [Selma to Montgomery March] a couple of years ago, is that it's a town that really believes in education.  They worship schoolteachers in Selma.  And they pro- they're really the middle class of the city, the schoolteachers, and they're, they're middle class--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, I don't know what Selma University does either in terms of grade level or whatever, but, but I know they worship learning in that town--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, okay, so--
Speaker 2: And some of the relatives later were involved in the Civil Rights Movement, as, you know, supporters, and, and the young kids were involved in the marching.
Story_ID: 612613
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?  So we had two--growing up in two different places.  Now how did they meet?
Speaker 2: As best I know, they met in Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother, of course, married a Methodist preacher, James B. Finley [ph.].  And my assumption is that they met in Birmingham.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so he, he was in Birmingham living there at a certain period of time and while your mother [Ethel Jones Holley] was there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But they don't tell the story how they fell in love or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They seemed to be--
Speaker 2: They didn't talk about things like that.  Our ears were too sensitive (laughter).
Speaker 1: It seemed like they, they believed in the, in the old principle that you don't talk to children about grown folks' business (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Little pitchers have big ears, and so the conversation would stop if it was something that children shouldn't hear.  That's why I was really surprised, you know, that my other siblings didn't know where my [paternal] grandmother was born, but she told me.  Maybe she thought I would remember, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my mother and father [Major Holley, Sr.] married in 1919.  He had already come to Detroit [Michigan].  And my grandmother, Sophia [Sophia Purdie], had come in 1918.  And he returned to Birmingham and married my mother, and they came to Detroit immediately after, in 1919, November of 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay, November of 1919?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 612614
Speaker 1: Now, historically, you know, if you take a black history course today, they'll tell you that 1919 was the Red Summer.  More black people were lynched in the South than in any other year in the history of this country, a good time to get out of the South, 1919.  Did your family, did they discuss how they were treated down there or any of the violence displayed towards black people in the South?
Speaker 2: I was told that the registration of black men in Alabama was such that my [paternal] grandmother [Sophia Purdie] did not want him to register for the draft in Alabama.  And so, of course, once he came to Detroit [Michigan] he registered in Detroit.  He did not go into the [U.S.] Army, but then he was working in, you know, a defense related, you know, foundry, so he was safe--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in that sense.
Speaker 1: All right, so there are no, any specific stories of racial violence that are passed down in your family from that period?
Speaker 2: Since my dad [Major Holley, Sr.] was, a proud man, he would tell stories of, you know, incidents that he would have with other workers, because the majority of them were either Hungarian or Polish.  And of course, you had to communicate with different--and because of his, his job, he probably was a little bit of a step up for a black worker than others.  And so evidently every once in a while there would be some, you know, altercation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he's about twenty-five years old or something--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --when he was in Detroit, I guess.
Speaker 2: --well, when he came he was twenty-one.
Speaker 1: Oh, he was born in 1895?
Speaker 2: Ninety-five [1895].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And yeah, and twenty--19--you know, '5 [1895] and--yeah--
Speaker 2: Twenty, twenty-one.
Speaker 1: --twenty-four.  That'd be, make him twenty-four exactly in--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --nineteen nineteen [1919].
Speaker 2: Oh, when he married?  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he came to Detroit the same year though, right?
Speaker 2: No.  He came to Detroit in 1915.
Speaker 1: Oh, I, I thought you said he came in 1919.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, he, he came back to Birmingham [Alabama]--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --to marry my mother [Ethel Jones Holley].
Speaker 1: Oh, all right, okay, so he was up, he already came.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He, yeah, he established himself in Detroit--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --then came here.  Okay, I misunderstood you, okay.  So, well, how was life in Detroit, I mean for your parents?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I have a postcard that one of his sisters sent to him with a request to get her on welfare, send her a train ticket, and find her a place to live.
Speaker 1: Now could that be done like that without the person there, I mean get them on welfare and then--
Speaker 2: I guess if you're in the South, and you don't know--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --you can ask.  She never came to Detroit.  He wouldn't have done that.  I, and I, I found the card many years after he would have passed away.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a simple request, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 612615
Speaker 1: So, well, when you think about your parents' personalities, and their dispositions, their talents and gifts, and you know, how they went about their business, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mother [Ethel Jones Holley], for the most part, until maybe I get upset.  Then I'm maybe I'm like my father [Major Holley, Sr.].  But most of the time I'm like my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause she was an en- encourager.  She would advise you without telling you the specific steps that you must make.  My father was the opposite.  He would tell you, "If I were you, I would do thus," and so, with no explanation.  And so naturally I talked to my mother.

Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you live in, in, in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Where I was born, it's part of Detroit called Eight Mile Road by those who were born out there.  It's one of the far northern edge of the City of Detroit.  Matter of fact, it's right on the county line for Wayne County [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this--
Speaker 2: And it's a small part of a subdivision three blocks deep and about twelve blocks long--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --primarily black.
Speaker 1: This right on the where--you know, the, the, the, what the general public outside Detroit always hears is that Eight Mile is where a white suburb would begin and Detroit ends--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --like in the movie '8 Mile,' featuring the rapper--
Speaker 2: Yeah, whoever that guy is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Eminem--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Eminem, yeah.  So, but, but there's a black neighborhood right on the border, you say, of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Eight Mile?
Speaker 2: Well, at, it borders both sides of Eight Mile Road, but we were on the, what we call, the Detroit side.  Oakland County [Michigan] is across Eight Mile, so that was the Ferndale [Michigan] side--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) as it was called when I was a little boy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, Ferndale.
Story_ID: 612617
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Sure.  When I was about two and a half, my dad [Major Holley, Sr.] chased me with a grub worm.  And I can remember him running behind me with his foundry boots on.  They were much larger than norm- normal shoes.  And that's what I remember.  And he would, he seemed to have so much glee about my running away, trying to get away from him.  And of course, two steps, you know, I--my legs was just short, and I couldn't get away from him.
Speaker 1: Okay, we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, so that--
Speaker 1: --we put a--
Speaker 2: I remember that and of course, the train trip down to Alabama for my, you know, grandmother's [sic. maternal great-grandmother, Roana Jones] funeral.
Story_ID: 612618
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: The Lone Pine chicken shack, Uncle Tom's Plantation, which was over on the Ferndale [Michigan] side.
Speaker 1: Now what was Uncle Tom's Plantation?
Speaker 2: It was like a nightclub.  And because of the segregated societies, musicians who were either part of the vaudeville, you know, hookup, and then the emerging jazz musicians like Count Basie, and Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughn, they would come, you know, they'd be hired to come to Uncle Tom's Plantation.  And you could always tell because the parking lot would all of a sudden fill up, and you'd have two, three row of cars.  And (laughter) there would be fights, 'cause folks, you know, get drunk and decide they're gonna conquer the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was, it was quite a unique place.
Speaker 1: Did you, you ever meet any of these celebrities in--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --day to day--
Speaker 2: --'cause I was too young.  One of the little side jobs that I ended up with, because we knew the owner, was to go in the next morning and clean up the beer caps and get them clip, you know, clean up the floor, 'cause the bartenders would just flip them on the floor when they, you know, filled them up.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, you were like--well, what were some of the other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, the area had been a pine forest.  And when they put the highway in, they had saved four of the pine trees.  And they were probably, you know, like eighty to a hundred feet tall.  And so that's, that's where some of the names of restaurants and stores, cleaners, things like that--
Speaker 1: What, they had, they had, they, they called them pines sometimes?
Speaker 2: Lone Pine.
Speaker 1: Lone Pine, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause eventually, there was only one that was left in, in that, that area where we lived, and later it was cut down when the road was expanded to three lanes, four lanes on each side.  When I was a small boy, it was only a two lane concrete strip, now divided.
Speaker 1: Okay, what, what road was that that they put in there?  Was it, was that--
Speaker 2: Eight Mile.
Speaker 1: Eight Mile Road? Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was called Eight Mile Road.
Speaker 1: All right, this, they just expanded it to four lanes?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 612619
Speaker 1: Was the church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I can remember when the church was, was built.  My dad [Major Holley, Sr.] and several other men helped do the work.  And as a small boy, I can remember just the walls and dirt floor.  And it had no furnace at the time, but they had communion around a number twenty wash tub for heat, you know, in the building.  And then later, because of a big windstorm, it blew the roof off, and all--most of the young children of the pastor were, they had to stay over at our house.  And that was about '38 [1938] I think, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now what, what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: At, at that time it was called Berean Tabernacle [Berean Chapel, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: And the building still exists, and it's hanging on.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I know your mother [Ethel Jones Holley] was an A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So was this the, the denomination of your, of your father--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or--
Speaker 2: It was a nondenominational, yeah.
Speaker 1: Nondenominational, okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, it was a part of--the, the leading pastor was influenced by Plymouth Brethren.  And so, yeah, in the, in the United, United States, of course, there were Plymouth Brethren.  And then he always just said assembly of Christian brethren, so.  But as far as practice is concerned it was basically the same.
Speaker 1: Is the Plymouth church near downtown Detroit [Michigan] related to the, to that--
Speaker 2: There is a Plymouth Congregational [Plymouth United Church of Christ, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Is Plymouth Congregational related to, to--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that--okay, all right, all right.  Okay, so--but the nondenominational church mean it's not--was, was it affiliated with any other churches around?
Speaker 2: With a similar group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were, there were seven, you know, similar groups.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the Holleys had their role--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: -everybody.  My mother sat on the end seat and all of the children by birth were in that row.  My father sat up front.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So like your wife [HistoryMaker Verna Holley], you were in a church that did not believe in like a lot of popular culture, celebrations and such.
Speaker 2: No movies--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no alcohol, although for breaking of bread they did use wine, no dancing, no--he didn't consort with those who did.  It was not a sect, but it was strictly, you know, Bible teaching centered church.
Story_ID: 612620
Speaker 1: You didn't get a lot of radio at home or anything like that as a result?
Speaker 2: We were a little bit different.  We had a Zenith radio set up tall.  We listened to the fights when Joe Louis would fight.  We listened to--my mother [Ethel Jones Holley] listened to 'Mary Marlin' ['The Story of Mary Marlin'].  We listened to the 'Green Hornet' ['The Green Hornet'] 'The Shadow,' 'Lone Ranger' ['The Lone Ranger'], 'One Man's Family.'  I guess because my father [Major Holley, Sr.] worked so early, there was no way he could police that.
Speaker 1: So he was a police on, on the, in this situation.
Speaker 2: My father was the law, and my mother was the patrolman who took care of, you know.  If she said, "I'm going to tell you father," it was automatic you were gonna get it.
Speaker 1: I'd put the lid on whatever activity--
Speaker 2: That would stop you, 'cause he, he was a strict disciplinarian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Numbered the licks that you're gonna get (laughter), and he would administer them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now this was not unusual in those days, right?  A lot people got, you know, I mean corporal punishment with, with children--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: --it was understood.  If, if one of our neighbors should find us, they would give us a, a smack and then tell the parents, and then you'd get it again for having gotten it from the neighbor.  The, the community where we were, well, as far as the boys, you knew all of the families, you know.  So you couldn't go eight blocks away and do something and not expect it to get back, and we didn't have a telephone.
Story_ID: 612621
Speaker 1: Okay, now was there a reason why you didn't have a phone?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Couldn't afford it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at, at that time, you know.  It was in the '40s [1940s] before we got a telephone.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I know we've talked to other people that didn't have a radio at the time, you know, and may have had the phone and not the radio, or you know, something else, you know.  Were people still using iceboxes basically?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yes.  There was no--well, I guess there were refrigerators, but we didn't have one.  And--
Speaker 1: And your heat was primarily coal or, or--
Speaker 2: It started out with coal and then was converted over to gas.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so, but the plumbing and stuff in those days, most people had indoor plumbing?
Speaker 2: My, my older siblings tell me that there was an outhouse.  I, I don't remember it.  My dad [Major Holley, Sr.], of course, he had friends who, you know, who were either homebuilders, because as I have been told, my grandmother lived with--my maternal grandmother [Mary Collins Jones] lived with the family for a period of time.  I, I did not know it, but at least the memory that I have.  They say I, I can't remember, 'cause I would have only been about one.
Speaker 1: Now how many brothers and sisters do you have, and what's the, the range in age?
Speaker 2: I have eight.  My oldest brother, Major, Jr. [Major Holley, Jr.], was born in 1924.  The last child, Thelma [Thelma Holley], was born in 1938.
Story_ID: 612622
Speaker 1: You mentioned the Joe Louis fights.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what--now that was a, from what I understand, that was fairly exciting event (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was. I mean to listen on radio and not, you know, not able to see boxers--and of course I remember the announcer was Don Dunphy.  And he would call the fights. And depending on who the, the, the boxer of the week was, I can remember Tony Galento, Max Schmeling--hm, don't have the other ones.  He finally had to tell him to get, get him off of him 'cause he was beating him so bad.  I do remember the first--no, not the first Schmeling fight, the second one.
Speaker 1: That's when Joe Louis beat--
Speaker 2: Oh yes--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --yes, yeah (laughter).  He beat him so quick, and then the whole neighborhood just erupted, you know.
Speaker 1: This is in the late '30s [1930s], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When he won the championship, I guess that was '38 [1938], yeah.  And from then on it seemed like he was fighting almost every month.  It may not have been, but it just seemed like it.
Speaker 1: I know they--there was a, there was a, you know, phrase, here the Bum of the Month Club or something--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) when he, he fought--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --somebody--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --every month, and they didn't last long, you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, it's amazing when, if, when you listen to Muhammad Ali talk about what he's going to do.  Joe Louis wouldn't say anything until the fight was over, and then he would always address his mother [Lilly Barrow Brooks], yep.
Speaker 1: Now was he, did you consider him like a role model for black men in those days?
Speaker 2: I think everyone did.  Matter of fact, my father-in-law [Henry Dorsey] had a, a picture, the Brown Bomber.  And there was a song, and there was a soda drink, a candy bar.  We know that he had a riding stable in Utica, Michigan.  My brother tells me that he came out to the Urban League where we were.  I think he's wrong, but he's older than I, so I just humor him.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the Barrow, Joe, Joe Louis' family, the Barrows--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from Alabama, they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --also did--did you know any of the family at all?
Speaker 2: Only after they were in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: 'Cause--yeah.
Speaker 2: And you know, we'd see pictures of his mother and then later the younger ones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course when he married, you know, we'd see pictures of the wives.
Story_ID: 612623
Speaker 1: Now did you ever go to the movies, coming out of the--
Speaker 2: Only once.  Well, I take it back.  I was a safety patrol boy at the elementary school [Higginbotham Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].  And so one of the treats, they would take you down to the Telenews Theatre in downtown Detroit [Michigan], and we would see the newsreels.  And then later we went to a Red--Red Wings [Detroit Red Wings] hockey game for being safety patrol boy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, when they had the children's concerts, myself and another student, girl, were allowed to leave school and take the bus and go down to the Masonic Temple [Detroit Masonic Temple, Detroit, Michigan] to hear the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.  And we were the only two during the times between 1941 and '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Let me, let me ask you--you said something I've never heard before.  The Telenews Theatre just, just specialized in newsreels?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'd never heard of that before in my whole life. So, so if you wanted to catch up on the news, you'd go to that theater--
Speaker 2: You could go, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you could sit down and sear- and hear and, and see a succession of newsreels about what's going on (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All across the world.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  I know I've seen the newsreels.  In fact, even when I was a kid they would show newsreels sometimes ahead of the movies.  But I did not know there was ever a theater where you could do that exclusively if you didn't want to see a drama or something.  Okay, so, to your knowledge, is that something that's pretty widespread around the country or just in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Well, since there were so many theaters in Detroit, I really don't really know.  I, I, I believe that there was one in New York City [New York, New York], but other than that, I don't, I really don't know.  I just would kind of guess it was owned by the same concern--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and they probably--
Speaker 1: The chains of them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) spread.
Speaker 1: --in the major cities maybe?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Detroit was certainly a big city.  So--
Speaker 2: See, downtown Detroit was an exciting place because if, if, if my mother [Ethel Jones Holley] was going to take us there, we had to dress up in our Sunday clothes and take the bus and streetcar, and, and then you would see so many people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, the J.L. Hudson store [J.L. Hudson Department Store; J.L. Hudson Building, Detroit, Michigan] was the big department store there.  Of course, as I grew older, I became aware that there was a, a class structure, both in terms of color and economic status because of the elevator operators at the J.L. Hudson Company versus other department stores.  We did not eat in the restaurant in that store.  When they had the Christmas celebration, we would always go down, you know, for that.
Speaker 1: The Thanksgiving Day Parade?
Speaker 2: They--I believe they started the Thanksgiving Day Parades after--'cause I never went to one until for our own children.  Now, now they had them, but, but our family didn't.
Story_ID: 612624
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about grade school.  Now, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Higginbotham, H-I-G-G-I-N-B-O-T-H-A-M, Elementary [Higginbotham Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a neighborhood school.
Speaker 1: And how did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved school.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: All of them.  My first crush was on the second grade teacher--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --named Portia, Portia Bethel [ph.].  And I didn't know, you know, you're not supposed to fall in love with teachers, but she taught me how to read, and I thought--but then she went out on maternity leave, and I forsook all women from that point on (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You didn't realize she was pregnant?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I didn't even know what that meant (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You didn't know what it meant, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: If they had said it.  But as I went through all of the grades, I, I enjoyed school.  I enjoyed learning.  I enjoyed reading.  And since my dad [Major Holley, Sr.] was a walking encyclopedia, the only way I'm gonna get to be like him I gotta do it, and I tried.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have--well, your favorite teacher I guess was the one you had the crush on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mrs. White [ph.] was my favorite--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --teacher.  We called her Foots, because of the length of her foot.  I don't know if she's still alive now or not, but she was grand.  She was the one who selected the students to go to the children's concert.  She taught gym, music, and obviously was a very smart woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were a patrol boy in, at elementary school, right.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: And that's a prestigious--did, did you all have to wear, get, get a chance to wear the badge and the belt--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --and the flag and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) wore the belt with my lieutenant's badge right on that belt, take it home, wash it and make sure it was white, be ready for the next day.
Speaker 1: And that was important to make sure that belt was clean.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And did they provide you with a flag that said stop?
Speaker 2: No, because I was a lieutenant (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, please explain those duties, you know.
Speaker 2: The lieutenant was over the other boys, so you would check corners to make sure they're doing their job.  So it was a form of, of training.
Speaker 1: Supervisory--
Speaker 2: If you had to take the child home, usually they would call for the lieutenant or captain to take the child home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I kind of flunked math one year because of it.  Detroit [Michigan] had started to expand, and they had put temporary homes for workers in the defense factories.  And so Higginbotham's population grew so that they cut it off at the sixth grade.  And then you had to go to the intermediate school.  And so that was a new experience for me, because I became one of--there are usually two black students in the classes.  My mother [Ethel Jones Holley] had insisted that I take college preparatory courses.  And she was very insistent and that's, that's what we had to do.
Speaker 1: Now what school did you go to next after Higginbotham?
Speaker 2: Post [Loren Post Intermediate School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Post?
Speaker 2: Post Intermediate.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now that was from seventh through--
Speaker 2: It would be--
Speaker 1: --ninth, or--
Speaker 2: --should be the, seven and eight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And from there, to Cass Technical High School [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you, so you were at, in the minority at Post then.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But Higginbotham was mostly black or--
Speaker 2: It was all, except the teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it--what--whether is it--were there any black teachers there?
Speaker 2: Yes, Mrs. White was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There probably were four or five.  It would--actually, Higginbotham was kind of a training ground for black teachers, because they, they were getting college grads with master's degrees and couldn't get into any of the schools, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Detroit.  So they were more black teachers at Higginbotham probably than any other elementary school.
Story_ID: 612625
Speaker 1: Did your, your grades drop off any, or did they stay the same when you went to intermediate school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I went to Post [Loren Post Intermediate School, Detroit, Michigan], in, in math; English, social studies, things like that, I mean I, I'm a word person, so, and I enjoy it.  Math was a little bit difficult for me and in algebra.  The introduction to algebra kind of floored me for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, eventually I, you know, I mastered it.  But it, it was, it was difficult.  And, and, and now I'm kind of fighting the social thing, learning it, because as I--I was, in a sense, alone.  Some classes I would be the only black child.
Story_ID: 612626
Speaker 1: Is Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] like a magnet school, or, or how did--
Speaker 2: Well, it--
Speaker 1: It's not in the neighborhood out there.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It, it, it was in downtown Detroit [Michigan], so to speak.  And it had, it was curriculum oriented, so you had to choose the curriculum that you were going to be a student in.  For instance, our graduating class was 625 students.  The, the school itself, seven--
Speaker 1: That's a--
Speaker 2: --floors.
Speaker 1: --that's a big class (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  It--
Speaker 1: --for a graduating class.
Speaker 2: --it took up an entire block.  They had built a new building, and I guess they're going to tear the old one down.
Speaker 1: Right, right, as we speak.
Speaker 2: But I had chosen auto-aero, automotive and aeronautical, as a curriculum.  I actually chose the school because my oldest brother, Major [Major Holley, Jr.], went there, and my second oldest brother, Harold [Harold Holley], was an auto mechanic.  So I was kind of fascinated with those two things, not knowing I didn't want to get my hands greasy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, did you stay in auto mechanics at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yes.  I, I, I graduated from my curriculum, but I wasn't really interested in, you know, as a career.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what was Cass like?  I mean was it, well, how many black stu- I mean what was the proportion of black students at Cass in those days?  Was it mostly white in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably less than 5 percent of the students.  You, your grade entry was how you got to go to the school, and of course you had to maintain it.  So you were drawing kids from all over the City of Detroit, and that, that's why the, the graduating class was so large.  And so it, it, it was an interesting experience, you see, be--
Speaker 1: Now were, were there any special teachers or mentors at Cass Tech?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the physics teacher, the metallurgy teacher.  Mrs. Quay [ph.] was the civics teacher.  The math teachers gave me fits, 'cause I had trouble with analytical geometry and then later on with solid geometry, but I finished.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you involved in any, any school activities?
Speaker 2: I ran track and cross country.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now you have any, anything close to the responsibilities that you had in grade school [Higginbotham Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan]?  You were, you know, being a lieutenant with the patrol boys is a big deal in grade school.  Was there any other--I mean did you run--
Speaker 2: Not at the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for class office or do any of that?
Speaker 2: No, not, not, not at the high school level.  And because everything, it was oriented by curriculum, I, I couldn't be in choir or glee club.  But I would try to stay as close, you know, to the students who were, you know.  The school was divided up in such a way that the classes that you went to for your curriculum were in the same area of the school, I mean because of the size.  And when you went to like chemistry or metallurgy, you might see a few kids.  But kids who were English majors, you nev- never see them except the lunchroom.  So it, it left you, you know, kind of divided up in a way you knew all the kids in your particular curriculum.  But, and some you wouldn't see un- unless you were in the auditorium.

Speaker 1: You graduated in 1951?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-one [1951].
Speaker 1: All right, and you were--so Cass Tech [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan] prepared you to actually go into auto mechanics at that point or what?
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I did, 'cause the first job I had was Department--[U.S.] Army Detroit Ordnance District, and I was a vehicle equipment servicer is what they called it.  That's kind of interesting.  I, I ended up with Detroit Ordnance, but they had sent me first to the [U.S.] Navy knowing--they knew, the person who sent me out there, they had had difficulty placing black students for employment.  But they used me as a test case without telling me they're gonna reject you, 'cause I think I would have fought them.  But I didn't know until I got back and then they said we're, they're building a case.  And eventually they did break it down, 'cause it was a, a federal agency, and they could not discriminate because of race.  But they were doing anyway, you know, internally.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, a lot of--that's the way de facto segregation works, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, now did you have good counseling in high school?
Speaker 2: Did I have?
Speaker 1: Good counseling?
Speaker 2: Cass was the kind of school that you were your own counselor, because they prescribed the--what courses you must take, and the elective courses, you know, were minor.  So you, you majored in your curriculum, and your grades had to keep you there, you know.  So e- even though I flunked that one, you know, I had to make up the grade point average to keep going, to stay in the school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so what did--so you got a job right out of high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 612628
Speaker 1: Now, you met your wife [HistoryMaker Verna Holley] when you were a teenager, right?  You, you, you maintained you met when you were fifteen, right?
Speaker 2: I met her when I was probably eight years old (laughter).  Because we went to the same circle of churches, I always knew she was, and she just didn't want to admit it.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But we did start formally going together when she was fourteen, fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But I just--I think she was saying that you may have seen her in a position of playing the piano or doing something like as--
Speaker 2: What--I would see her piano--
Speaker 1: --as a music director, or--
Speaker 2: --when she had to play for our family group.  She was always there.  My sister was involved in a trio, so I always--they would practice out at the house, so I always saw her--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and never forgot her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you really started going together at age fourteen or fifteen, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't call it that.  We would go to Voice of Christian Youth [Voice of Christian Youth America] meetings, youth meetings that were held at Miller High School [Sidney D. Miller High School, Detroit, Michigan] (unclear). And so I would always see her.  And, and my parents [Ethel Jones Holley and Major Holley, Sr.] were friends with her parents [Pearl Richardson Dorsey and Henry Dorsey].  And so when her mother passed away, they went to see the family--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and I was with them.
Story_ID: 612629
Speaker 1: Now you eventually went into the [U.S.] Army, but how long did you work before you went into the Army?
Speaker 2: Well, it was about two years--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause then I was drafted in 1953, and I came back in late January, 1955.  And of course at that time you had to spend two years active duty and six years reserve duty.  Then I met a, a, a friend from the neighborhood, and it was he who convinced me, you know, use your training in the National Guard, and I did.  I signed up for it [Michigan Army National Guard], not knowing that he was gonna get out.  And of course, I stayed in for the next thirty-seven years.
Speaker 1: Now was--let's go back to when you first went in.  I mean was--did you--would you--did you have any expectations from the service?  Were any of your brothers in the service before you?
Speaker 2: Well, the Korean War was going on at the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I guess there was, you know, kind of a basic fear.  But I was trained as an anti-aircraft artillery crewman first.  And then I was selected to attend electronics school and was trained on the, a different radar control gun.  And that's what took me to England.
Story_ID: 612630
Speaker 1: How were you treated?  Now, the men who joined the [U.S.] Army or were drafted during War World II [WWII] tell horrible stories of their, their treatment.  And so you, you, you come in shortly after the armies have been integrated, right?  This is--
Speaker 2: In name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was inducted at Fort Custer, Michigan [Fort Custer Training Center, Michigan].  Well, I take, take back--Fort Wayne [Detroit, Michigan] and then bused to Fort Custer.  Then we were sent from there to Fort Bliss, Texas.  At that time, I only knew one other person from Michigan.  He happened to be a white fellow.  We met at Fort Custer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fort Bliss was a brand new experience for me, 'cause now I'm thrust in with mainly southern, whether black or white, soldiers.  And it, it was a new experience for me.
Speaker 1: Well, how were they different?
Speaker 2: They liked country and western music.  They didn't mind letting you know they didn't like me.
Speaker 1: And what reason would they give for--I mean was that--they, did they generally not like you, or just some people didn't like you?
Speaker 2: Well, some of them, some of--it, it wouldn't be true of all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but I trained with many of them, matter of fact, went over to England with some of the same fellows.  And the first base that we were on in England on a, it was an English airbase.  And it just so happened that couple of black G.I.s came up in a taxi cab.  I was in a different room, and the other fellows--now we're all--it was twenty-nine of us, and, and they were saying all the things if I--if, if they were at home, this is what would happen to this, because there were English girls also in the taxi.  You know, I, I just felt, well, I'd better make my presence known and see if--if you're gonna say something, if you're gonna say it to me about, you know, other G.I.s, at least differentiate, you know.  And so I, you know, after that I had no trouble with them.  The ones who were troublemaker, you know, you, you just learned how to deal with them.  And if I was over them, then it was because of the training and knowledge that I had.  And that, that's how I tried to conduct myself from that point on any of the military units, you know, that I was a part of.
Story_ID: 612631
Speaker 1: What was your, your job primarily, your--
Speaker 2: I was a radar mechanic on the 75mm Skysweeper gun, as it was called.  It was a replacement for low flying aircraft of that era.  And of course, this is during the period ending the Cold War--ending the Korean War and really the startup of what was the Cold War.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And so the base that we were on was a, what they called a training base.  And aircrafts that were going between Europe and the United States would land for refueling and training.  And our gun site was at the end of the runway, so you, you, you saw all this different fighter aircraft and the B-36 bomber [Convair B-36] and to, to transport aircraft, things of that sort.  So it was our job to identify if it was a foreign aircraft and whether or not we should shoot it down.  Of course, we never had to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who made the ultimate decision about that?  Was it--
Speaker 2: You mean?
Speaker 1: About whether to shoot it down or not.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The president of the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay, so if you saw--even if you decoded one that's, one that should be shot down, you'd have to wait a little while to--
Speaker 2: You'd have to wait for it, yeah.
Speaker 1: It might be gone by the time (laughter) or--
Speaker 2: Well, well, no.  If, if they were menacing, you know, then you'd have to be prepared to, you know, react.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But if it was a really--it could be a reaction in a timely way then?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so, well, how long were you in England?
Speaker 2: Six months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was five months and twenty-five days, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They wasted money.
Story_ID: 612632
Speaker 1: And so where did you go next?  Where did you go next?
Speaker 2: Back to the states.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then I was taken off of active duty and then started the reserve portion.  See, and that was supposed to be six years originally.  But in the meantime I had joined the National Guard [Michigan Army National Guard] in '56 [1956].  So, about a year and a half after returning off active duty, then the time with the National Guard started.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when did you really start with the National Guard (unclear)--
Speaker 2: October of '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, 1956, all right.
Speaker 2: And of course, I was classified as a radar mechanic, and they had 90mm guns at that time.  Detroit [Michigan] at that time had sixteen gun sites that were ringed around Detroit, and so we were one of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, okay, now what did you do generally for a living, I guess, after you got back?  I mean (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That was my full time job.
Speaker 1: That was job, okay.  All right, so you worked for National Guard basically--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --full time.  So you didn't have to wait to be called up for weekends and--
Speaker 2: No, 'cause they would call a, a--
Speaker 1: You were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) full time cadre.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And eventually we were trained next on the Nike Ajax air defense missile, then Nike Hercules.  And then once it ran out or the time was decided that it was no longer needed, that's when I had to transfer up here--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or had the opportunity to transfer up here, 'cause at first, they were just gonna disband.  But of course, by that time, I had invested almost seventeen years, you know, with them.  So, I did have to write letters reminding the powers to be that they shouldn't treat me that way.  And they decided I guess I'd better, better bring you up to Lansing [Michigan].
Speaker 1: So were you looking forward to coming to Lansing [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I had, I had thought that I would be able to work for Chrysler [Chrysler Corporation; FCA US LLC], you know, training kind of capacity, back to the old auto equipment days, but then Chrysler went bankrupt.  So it was designed for me not to go there.  And that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --how I ended up here.
Speaker 1: So, so what year is this when you, you come here to Lansing?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I came here in 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, and then you brought your family up later, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, in 1970.
Story_ID: 612633
Speaker 1: Now there're a couple of things that happened I didn't ask you about.  And they would concern someone in the National Guard [Michigan Army National Guard].  Well, the, the riots, did, did you have any role to play as a National Guardsman during the--
Speaker 2: No, because--
Speaker 1: --riots in '67 [1967]?
Speaker 2: --at, at the time of the '67 [1967] riots, I, I was on a twenty-four hour, you know, unit, so they couldn't call us up, you know, for, you know, activity--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that way.  But I still had to wear the uniform and you know, go to the missile site every morning.  And, and so it was kind of touchy every once in a while, because, you know, snipers were firing, you know, randomly.  And you never knew what, you know, if we stepped out of the car, may- maybe that (laughter), that bullet was intended, you know.  Because see, we had a, a unit of about, well, about thirty-eight guys who were full time cadre.  The other guardsmen would come in to supplement it, you know, for training.  And if we were called, you know, on, up active, because then we were part of the defense ring for the City of Detroit [Michigan].
Story_ID: 612634
Speaker 1: How'd you like Lansing [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: It was a learning experience.  Detroit [Michigan], of course, there was always some activity going on, people you would see, you know.  Lansing, because the state government is here, when it shuts down, downtown did not exist anymore.  You know, I mean, and when we got here there was no garbage collection, no--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Bus.
Speaker 2: --bus service--something, there was about three things.  And I said, "Oh, what have I done?" (Laughter) And it was, the, the first couple of years were difficult, you know, because we, we normally think of ourselves as making friends, you know, very easily.  But if you're not born in Lansing, you're treated as outsiders.  But we finally, you know, my one teacher friend who knew, knew Verna [Holley's wife, HistoryMaker Verna Holley] and knew that we were involved in music.  And so that's how we ended up joining the, the Nelson Singers [Earl Nelson Singers].  Actually, we auditioned for them and then didn't hear anything for a while, until we saw Ms. West [ph.] again.  And that's how we, you know--come on back; we need you.  And so, that's how we, we got involved with them, and ever since.
Story_ID: 612635
Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Melvin Julius Holley [HistoryMaker Melvin J. Holley]; it's M-E-L-V-I-N, J-U-L-I-U-S, H-O-L-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 27, 1933.
Speaker 1: And, and what is your place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Detroit, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: During my work career, I was a em- a federal employee of the Michigan Army National Guard, and I was quartered at the U.S. Property and Fiscal Office for Michigan in Lansing [Michigan].  And the military rank was a chief warrant officer.  And as a budget officer I was required to be in, in charge of the military budget that was sent into the State of Michigan for the logistics, supplies, pay, training, travel for Michigan Army National Guardsmen.
Speaker 1: In terms of your organizational affiliation, what is your position?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm past president of the Lansing Area African American Genealogical Society [Lansing, Michigan] presently.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's known as LAAAGS, right?
Speaker 2: And it's LAAAGS, L-A-A-A-G-S, a fairly young organization for the Lansing area, but our interest has always been in the, the history of our communities.  And so we've focused on early African American families who came to the City of Lansing, some starting as far back as the 1840s, and up to the present.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is October the 23, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Presently, we're at my home.  My wife [HistoryMaker Verna Holley] and I live in the southwest portion of Lansing called River's Edge subdivision.
Story_ID: 612636
Speaker 1: Now, we're continuing an interview that we started back in 2007 [sic. 2008].  I think it was, well, winter of 2007 I know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --probably February.  And I believe we left off discussing the, the history of the organization, LAAAGS [Lansing Area African American Genealogical Society, Lansing, Michigan].  So, now you were a history major in college, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You, you took courses in history at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  And who were some of you--we may have already talked about this, but who were some of your mentors at Michigan State?
Speaker 2: We, we can, can speak very quickly of Richard Thomas [Richard W. Thomas], Dr. Richard Thomas, who was a Detroiter, and, and I, and had courses with him.  At the time he was working on his doctoral program at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] until he was the instructor that I was drawn to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what courses did he teach?  Do, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time he was, he was writing a book about his experience in, in the City of Detroit [Michigan], that of his family, and particularly where his father and other relatives worked in the city, some of the housing situations that they were confronted with, and that book also included an hit- a history of the, the City of Detroit, as far as African Americans were concerned.  And, and of course that was of interest to me because that was where I had been born.  So some of the things that he spoke of, I had already lived through them in, in many cases.  And, and so it was, it was very helpful to have a, a chance to dialogue with him about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did he, was he focusing on the Black Bottom section of Detroit, or, or did he focus on the west side, or--
Speaker 2: He, well, he, he came from the area that was actually east of what was traditionally called Black Bottom.  Eventually it became--well, it, it's, it's, nowadays, in 2012, it's a very devastated area of the City of Detroit, principally because most of the construction that was done there was done rather cheaply.  And many of the houses were constructed for immigrant workers who came into Detroit, not necessarily African Americans but Italians, Belgians.  And, and for that reason, that same housing becomes available later to, to black Americans.  And Richard's growing up days in the area around Mack Avenue, as, as he would relate it, was a, a, a difficult time for, for him and, and family, and because the father, you know, was a factory worker.  And, and he, he would speak of relatives, some who had, you know, great difficulties trying to make the dollar stretch.  And, and so his, his young days especially he was abject poverty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was Dr. Thom- Thomas compiling, recording and stuff his families in order to--
Speaker 2: In some cases he did, in speaking of the, the community where he, where he grew up and some of the things that, particularly, you know, his parents' experience, and, and then as a backdrop, of course, the history of the City of Detroit and from an economic standpoint, from the standpoint of social restrictions, things of that sort.  So he would recount some of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so he was looking at I guess the history of the city from the particular--you know, he, he covered the general history of the city but then looking at the particular things that happened to his own family--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --within the context of that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --larger picture.
Speaker 2: His family and in similar ones that--it was not a rubber stamp, but many families, those who were seeking to break out of that mold.  He, he would recount, you know, some of the difficulties and, and restrictions that were placed on them.
Story_ID: 612637
Speaker 1: Now this, having come along I guess as a history student in those days, in the '70s [1970s] myself, there's, I remember that the Association for the Study of Negro African History [sic. Association for the Study of Negro Life and History] which became African American Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History] in 1972.  At that conference they had several sessions on oral history.  And they, they were, there was actually debate about whether oral history is really history, you know, and that sort of thing, you know, can you really believe in it?  Can you--is it, is what you're hearing verifiable, or is it--therefore is it valuable because you, you know, you're getting it from people who lived it rather than (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --somebody else who wrote about it, which seems kind of crazy now, you know.  But, but did, did, did you have those kind of discussions in class about oral history in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes.  One of the things about oral histories, you have the ability to tell what you saw, what you thought, how you felt and then, for instance, in Detroit [Michigan] Cadillac Square was a terminus.  Sam Cutrey--Cut Rate Drug Store [Sam's Cut Rate Drug Store] was there.  And so if a person talked about Sam's Cut Rate Drugs, it was just a building, you know, but they also knew the product.  They knew how long it was open or how late it was open, what you could get there.  So when a person gives an oral history, it has to make sense because they lived through it, and they shared it with others who had similar experience.  Oral history is, is history no matter whether it's written or spoken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it's subject to be interpreted by professionals and nonprofessionals alike, right? As a--
Speaker 2: If, if a professional wanted to double check some of the facts, it would be easily, could easily be done because they could compare it with similar experiences that others had or spoke of.  And for that reason, there is validation that they can derive from it.
Story_ID: 612638
Speaker 1: Was this your first experien- experience with oral history?
Speaker 2: No. Within our, our immediate family.  I lived during the summers between eight and six up to about twelve with my [paternal] grandmother [Sophia Purdie], who had been born in North Carolina.  And for some reason, she would tell me things that my other brothers and sisters just could not recollect or had no interest in.  I learned things about my grandmother, which were just unknown to me.  My father [Major Holley, Sr.] had come to Detroit [Michigan] in about 1914, 1915, and so there were a great number of things that I did not know, other than in quizzing my older brothers and sisters.  So it was, it was helpful to me, to find out where she was born, when she was born, and a, a little bit about conditions within her immediate family, which of course affected my father and subsequently myself.
Story_ID: 612639
Speaker 1: What I'm asking is, is this the first time or, or that you heard these stories referred to as history or, or, or thought that?  Because you know, we're--in school we're presented history, and it usually doesn't contain anything about us.  It's a history of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My [paternal] grandmother [Sophia Purdie] was not in any of the books that I was required to study, other than the fact that she lived in North Carolina, and the State of Alabama, the State of Michigan for a period of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and they could be divided up, you know, you know, if viewing her life in segments of time.
Speaker 1: Yep.  But I get- what I'm getting at is do you--is this the first time you heard that, that the stories that are passed down in your family could be considered history or, or should be considered with the same seriousness as, as the history that is taught in school?
Speaker 2: They had to be.  We, we come into every new situation in blocks of time.  One of the stories that was told to me: my grandmother did not want my father [Major Holley, Sr.] to be drafted for World War I [WWI] in Alabama.  And so her encouragement was for him to leave Alabama and come to Michigan.  Brand new experience for him, for there was no family in Detroit [Michigan] at that time.  So he, he's on kind of the first wave of rural Alabamans coming to the State of Michigan to find work, establish household.  At that time, he was not married.  And it, it's a historical event.  World War I did occur.  There was drafting of, of men, of, depending on their age, three different times.  And, and I happened to, to find the, the draft card of my father.  I had never seen it until after he died.  So those, those are the kinds of things, you know, that you learn from parents, from older brothers and sisters.  And you have to put them into, or weave them into a story of my life as a result of it.  That's, that's part of my interest in helping other families do the same things.
Speaker 1: Now, now what's implied in that story--well, she didn't--well, it's pretty plain that she did not want him drafted in Alabama.  The, the implication is that something was wrong with being drafted in Alabama (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: --which, and so which talks about another dynamic, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was not until about 1995 or so that I found out why.  I knew that the [U.S.] military forces were segregated in all of the wars, but the particular thing that I, that I noticed was how the newspaper write up of those men who were Caucasian and drafted was handled differently than those of black Americans who were drafted.  And they were sent to, usually to what we call petroleum and lubricating units, or they were basically stevedores.  The [U.S.] Army were not drafting men to, to fight for their country.  They were going to be the labor force for their country.  And evidently my grandmother had found out what that implied and thought that Michigan would not treat her son like that.  Unfortunately, it still did (laughter).
Speaker 1: It didn't make a lot of difference--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --but it, but she, she was trying to protect him from--
Speaker 2: She thought she was, yes.
Speaker 1: --what she actually knew was going on in Alabama.
Story_ID: 612640
Speaker 1: When you were in school for history here at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], did, did you have any oral history courses as such?
Speaker 2: Not as such.  The, the emphasis was more on the studies that they knew of.  There, there, there are many books of history, of course, and they're written from the viewpoint of, of the person, the location that they're writing from or their field of specialty.  And so there would be, in most cases, a glossing over of the importance of various parts of the American populace and the, the history and the Spanish American War, World War I [WWI], World War II [WWII].  You can still see the, the thought that only segregated forces would be of advantage to the nation.  And, but what it underscored is more of a social problem within the country, not the lack of bravery or inability to accomplish particular tasks when you're in a teamwork together.  We, we learned oral history by interviewing persons to find out their thoughts, their aspirations, their hopes, and the defeats that they encounter, or the victories that they gain.  And they may seem to be a small composite of that whole person, but yet they're, they're, in dealing within, you know, the framework of others who may have similar experience or struggles that they have to try to make some sense of.  My, my father [Major Holley, Sr.], as, as an example, since there were eight of children in our family, he wanted to make sure that we were all educated.  And he helped to, to, to direct each of us to know what education was.  It wasn't just learning to read but the content of what you read, and of course, it, it had its, its bearing, you know, on me.  And so of course I would, I would ask questions of family members and then try to tuck them into a framework that would be helpful to me.
Speaker 1: So you've done this--you're saying you've been involved in this kind of your, your whole life in, in the sense of collecting the stories of your family members?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--but in terms of the question I originally, is, was, did Dr. Thomas [Richard W. Thomas] or did anyone else in, in the history department teach oral history formally in those days?  Did you, did you have any of that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or--it sounds like Dr. Thomas' book was based on his own family oral history.  But I just wondered if he assigned the class, a class project to do anything like that.
Speaker 2: Well, no, he didn't, he didn't.
Speaker 1: But it's something you had already--I, I know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I was already doing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, already doing it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 612641
Speaker 1: The other part of it was similar to, you know, learning what the newspapers in the City of Selma, Alabama, wrote about draftees that were going off, you know, valiantly to war as opposed to those guys who they were gonna sneak out of town and send them to Ohio or, well, Chillicothe, Ohio, where they were training all soldiers.  But when they get to Chillicothe, they're in a separate camp because of the segregation, which is a social, you know, determinant--had nothing to do with military ability.
Speaker 2: Yeah, World War I [WWI] was a war in which the U.S. government basically assigned black troops to the French Army because they didn't want to--
Speaker 1: They, they allowed it because they did not believe that they would accomplish what the U.S. wanted to do.  But a bullet will find a body if they're in the way.

Speaker 1: Was there anybody else at, at Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] when you were working on your history degree that was influential--or did, did Dr. Thomas [Richard W. Thomas] ever finish his book, and did you--
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Did, did you get a copy of it?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Still have it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so he was in the history department (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: He actually was in the African studies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Or African American studies.
Speaker 2: Yes, Af- then I don't know if they called it exact- it, it, it kind of evolved of course, coming out of some difficulties with what to name studies, or why should there be a department of African studies?  Why couldn't there just be in the history department?  Well, we already know the answer to that.  If it wasn't taught at the elementary and high school levels, surely it would be forgotten in secondary education, you know, university or college.  So eventually, there were departments of African studies and African American studies.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now did you focus on American history when you were a history student or--
Speaker 2: Eventually I did.  I had, I had started, well, basically with ancient history when I was first drafted into the [U.S.] Army.  Of course, the Army had eduquate- education courses that you could sign up and, and do them on base.  And that's where I started, you know, but I decided ancient wasn't, wasn't the thing that I solely interested.  I wanted to know more about the, the exclusion in American history of me.
Speaker 1: In 1976 you, you got a degree in history [from Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], but you already had a career going so you didn't really--did, did you--you didn't really use your historical degree in your work, did you or didn't you?
Speaker 2: I had, I had thought at one time that I could be in, you know, in a, in the teaching field.  But one, one of the problems at that time was the, the military assignment that I had, and it precluded me from being able to do student teaching and also to continue with the military role that I had.  And so that's one of the reasons why I decided, okay, I'll, I'll, I'll pursue the degree, and I'll keep my own personal studies going.
Story_ID: 612643
Speaker 1: Now from '76 [1976] to 2000, when the Lansing Area African American Genealogical Society [Lansing, Michigan] was established, were--between that time, were you involved in any other historical organizations?
Speaker 2: I was doing genealogical studies then, partly on both the, my, my father's [Major Holley, Sr.] family line and my mother's [Ethel Jones Holley], which of course branched me into other aunts, uncles, cousins that I knew very little about because of my father coming to Detroit [Michigan].  And I found out that we had a larger family that were still in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Now that's a--there's a, there's a new book out as a--well, it's a couple of years old now, but it's called 'Warmth of Other Suns' [sic. 'The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration'] by--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a delightful book.
Speaker 1: --Dr. Wilkerson [Isabel Wilkerson] I believe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, and she talks about the migratory patterns and several stories about migration, you know, from the South and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --interesting stories.  But one of the, one of the familiar patterns is Alabama to Ohio to Michigan, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean that seems like a route, just like--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --Mississippi and Arkansas made it to Chicago [Illinois].  And--
Speaker 2: Well, depending on where you are in the Southeast or Southwest, North Carolina, Virginia, New York, Alabama, Ohio, Pennsylvania.  My wife's [HistoryMaker Verna Holley] family comes from Tallassee, Alabama, and end up in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and other small towns around it because of coal mining, some because of steel mills.  My father was a molder in a foundry and, and, and, and very good at it evidently because I remember some of the various things that he would bring home and proudly say that he had molded this, you know, you know, object, some of which were hood ornaments on automobiles or bookends.  A very interesting one that he had was of, it appeared to be dog.  And when you would lift its tail and open its mouth, you could put a walnut or a pecan in there, and when you pressed it down it would crack the nutshell. And so, of course, I was proud of my father, you know, for that reason.  But he didn't want his sons to follow the same career that he did, and, and it was somewhat of a surprise, you know, to me.  I didn't know what a foundry really entailed until later.
Speaker 1: Did he, did he experience working in a foundry in Alabama?  I know they have one in Birmingham [Alabama] and other places in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: I know Selma's [Selma, Alabama] in--
Speaker 2: He worked more or less as a stock boy for a drugstore. Was more like a porter.  That, that was one of the things I learned.  There would be a strata of, of jobs.  He, he wasn't the manager of the drugstore or could not attain that, but he could be a stock boy.
Story_ID: 612644
Speaker 1: What I was trying to get at is, like, what led up to the founding of the Lansing Area African American Genealogical Society [Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: There, there were about six people who lived here in Lansing [Michigan], some were educators, some were workers in state departments here, and found out, because of their friendships, that they were working on similar constructions of, of their own personal families' histories.  And because of it, they de- decided they would like to form a, a larger group.
Speaker 1: Now let me ask, let me ask you this, did, did, did, how did the six people meet?  Now, what I have here, are these the six: yourself, Melvin Holley [HistoryMaker Melvin J. Holley], Wilbur Howard, Brenda Henderson, Carrie Baptiste Jackson, Jan Smith Lewis, Mary Agnes Lipscomb.  Are those the six?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so did you all meet in a organization before that or a church or in a library?  Or how did you fir- finally--
Speaker 2: I, I met the others later.  I mean I, I had, I had not--I had known them as, you know, principals at schools, teachers.  Mr. Howard, a real versatile guy, worked for one of the departments of state.  And he knew, because he grew up in Lansing, he knew many of the black families here, you know, as a child.  And so it was really his dream to see this happen.  And some of the skills I think that, that I brought to it was more in organizi- organizing to pursue the nonprofit status for the organization.  So basically, it, it took about, about two years, you know, to, to obtain (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, what I'm, what I'm asking is that did he send flyers out, or did he call you on a phone?  How, how did he get all, you all together, or had you known--
Speaker 2: Through friendships.
Speaker 1: Through--okay.
Speaker 2: And he asked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he just called everybody up that he knew who was--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Would--
Speaker 1: --interested?
Speaker 2: --would we do this--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know?  And in, in, in, in meetings that we had, that's how the, the LAAAGS was formed.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is in 2000, right, turn of the century?  Did--now was he--it seems as though to me that people in the black community became interested in genealogy formally around that time, and a lot of groups were formed.  Was there an incident or an event or a publication or something that sparked this kind of a movement?
Speaker 2: I think the, the book, 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family'] by Alex Haley, and then the television, you know, renditions of it heightened the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the desire to do this.  If, if Alex Haley can do it, his story is no different than mine, you know, little pieces.  And out of it--
Speaker 1: Now 'Roots' was published in '76 [1976] or '77 [1977] I believe--well, '76 [1976] I guess, or maybe even before then.  But I know the TV show came out in '77 [1977], winter of '77 [1977].  And so that, yeah, yeah, you're right.  That, that did spark a lot of interest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It stimulated the, the interest.
Speaker 1: But you all don't form until 2000.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 612645
Speaker 1: The others were seeing one another, meeting one another in, you know, other--like, Mrs. Jackson [Carrie Baptiste Jackson], her husband [Maxie C. Jackson] is at the university [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  She's doing genealogical studies out of Louisiana more for her husband's family than her own.  And because of Louisiana, there were the baptistery records that are required in the Catholic church and what have you.  And she found that she was able to trace back to others, and she, she shared that with the others.  Ms. Lipscomb [Mary Agnes Lipscomb] is originally from Alabama, but she knew that the family had moved to Missouri.  But she didn't know the family members, just her immediate family.  Ms. Henderson [Brenda Henderson], similar in, you know.  So they're all doing their own thing and then find out some of these things that we're trying to find out, each of them are having to go the same way.  Someone said well, why not have one group and help others to do the same kinds of things.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, now that's what I'm trying--okay.
Speaker 1: And, and now, Mr. Howard [Wilbur Howard] didn't have the, the, I'll say the necessary writing skills, but he had a very interesting story with his family, part of which came out of slavery at the end of slavery, and what happened to bring them from South Carolina into Michigan.  When you look at--many people, they are able to say, yes, my family also came from point A and end up point B.  Why?  It could be employment; it could be the betterment within a society; it could be the education of their children.  And so that what LAAAGS [Lansing Area African American Genealogical Society, Lansing, Michigan] was attempting to do, is to gather people with research and, and provide a forum, you know, to help educate and also to stimulate the writing of family histories.
Story_ID: 612646
Speaker 1: How many times would, would LAAAGS [Lansing Area African American Genealogical Society, Lansing, Michigan] meet say in the--
Speaker 2: We, we met monthly and then later because of the summer, vacation period, and then it was two months were dropped off.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But now the organization meets ten months out of the year?
Speaker 2: Ten months out of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And so, so what are the meetings like?
Speaker 2: Basically, the meetings are a, a formal presentation by an individual that relates some facet of their own personal family history or some research possibilities.  As an example, when the 1940 census was released after seventy-two years, it, it made it possible for many to look back on their own families or to try to find where families were, what their status was, what their worth was.  Depending on the questions that were on the census, it, it opened up some brand new things about their individual families.  And of course, that could also be a, a, a drawback where people don't know what public records are available and how they can search them for themselves.  They're locked up in a building.  Later, because of the computer access, many have started to be put online, if, if you know where to look for them, and that what LAAAGS attempts to do.  Something new or some newer research tool becomes available, we try to make certain that we can draw on it.
Speaker 1: Now what have been--so did the organization grow beyond the six that--the family?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Family history is unique.  Every family wants to know their history, which they're looking for they're tied to a president or a king.  And if they can't find it, then they get exasperated or they run into a brick wall, and they put it aside.  We try to keep encouraging.  If you find a brick wall, there must be a pathway around it; keep looking.  And in some ways we try to see or stimulate the interest by bringing in others.  Although it may not be African American history, the techniques are still, you know, viable and, and should be used.  We try to encourage the, the participation in seminars that are provided.  We also try to encourage going to archives or to libraries that have more extensive collections and to be able to utilize them.  The, the, the online research has added a new dimension to it.  But it can be difficult because now, now you begin to look at the similarities of names.  And you have to do a little bit more detective work to make sure this is my family, that, that I'm--I, I see the names, and they, they look good, but then you find out that there are many rabbit trails that occur if, if you're not careful.
Story_ID: 612647
Speaker 1: Is there any substitute for actually going to the site of, that you're--I mean I, I guess there are some substitutes, but is it, is it--do, do you recommend actually making a journey to the--
Speaker 2: Yes.  This year, for instance, we, we went to Battle Creek [Michigan], which is only fifty miles away or so, because they have the Sojourner Truth statue [Sojourner Truth Monument] there in a park [Monument Park], the cemetery in which she's buried, and, and, and we visited there.  There are other historical sites in the City of Battle Creek that we've visited.
Speaker 1: But what I was asking though was for instance in your own family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Would, would it be--is it--could you get the--do the same amount of research online as you could if you actually went to, back to Selma [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: The library in Selma has telephone books, but they may only be from the 1950s.  I, I need something from 1895, you know.  Of course, it, it, it meant going to Montgomery [Alabama].
Speaker 1: You just raised something important.  A, a telephone book can be an important source of information (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --about where your family members lived--
Speaker 2: If you have the money to finance a telephone system (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, it may or may not tell that they were--yeah.
Speaker 2: It, it would tell where they lived.  It would tell--the city directory would tell what their occupation was stated to be.  It might even tell if they were colored or not.  Sometimes it, it may give an idea of how many family members were living at a dwelling, whether they were students or not.  And from that you can draw a map of the community in which they lived, and, and that's, that's a neat thing, though.  Those directories are available at libraries.  We've run into a little bit of a problem here in Lansing [Michigan], money wise, because the Library of Michigan, example, is co-located in a building where the Archives of Michigan [Lansing, Michigan].  But because of budget restraints, the Library of Michigan, of which had an exclusive collection of materials, not just for Michigan, but every state that a person, if they'd written a, a family history, they could deposit it there in the Library of Michigan.  The, the, the wise people decided it should only have Michigan items in it, and they just almost willy nilly decided well sell off anything that is not Michigan.  Of course, we had a little bit of struggle and had to go down and try to lobby representatives or state senators to get them to think about family histories and the research necessary, but we lost.  But we won't stop.  And, and so that, LAAAGS [Lansing Area African American Genealogical Society, Lansing, Michigan], became a part of the Michigan Genealogical Society [sic. Michigan Genealogical Council, Lansing, Michigan], which is a combining of all of the various genealogical societies and family history groups within the state.  And so, of course, that kind of gets into the political, but, well, it's, sometimes it's felt necessary.  So, you know, we're plugged in too.  The decisions that were made, of course, it was get the archive to accept the Michigan items, because the library then was closed for parts of the week and not available for people who wanted to come in and do research on weekends.  But it's, that, that's a thing that you have to work with and, and hopefully continue, you know, your own research.
Story_ID: 612648
Speaker 1: LAAAGS [Lansing Area African American Genealogical Society, Lansing, Michigan] has been in existence for twelve years.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  What have been some of the highlights of the, of LAAAGS?
Speaker 2: We've, we've e- either participated in seminars that we sponsored or were sponsored by other organizations or as co-sponsors.  We've had visits from the, the--Tony Burroughs [HistoryMaker Anthony "Tony" Preston Burroughs], of course, a genealogist, was here, and it, it did stir a great amount of interest in African Amer- American research because of him.  There is Douglas Dyson [ph.] out of the Detroit [Michigan] area, has also been up.  We've participated for about five years with the family history center [Family History Library, Salt Lake City, Utah], which is a part of the Church of Latter-day Saints [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints], each May where we would do the African American study portion of their seminar.  And of course, as, as I said, we collaborate with other genealogical societies when they have their program.  We encourage our members to, to take part in the Abrams Seminars [Abrams Foundation Family History Seminar], which is held each, each year in October.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, well, what that?  What, what is that?
Speaker 2: Abrams?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Abrams [Talbert Abrams] was a, the, the man, had a, an aeronautical survey business and established a foundation whose purpose was to encourage genealogical research.  And so some, some of the funding comes as a result, doesn't come to LAAAGS as such, but because we are part of the Michigan Genealogical Society [sic. Michigan Genealogical Council, Lansing, Michigan], of course we are able to participate with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Abrams group trains people in how to--what about the resources that are available, or, or--
Speaker 2: They, they expose people, I, I would say, to research methods and means that are available.  They are able to draw in a, a wider field so that people who are part of the Federal Genealogical Society [sic. Federation of Genealogical Societies], which is a nationwide group, along with the Salt Lake City repository from the Church of Latter Saints, it, it, it exposes numbers of people, you know, to more records, more available records.  And, and so that's, that's one of the reasons why in, in Michigan, you know, we would need to be a part of a group like that so that we get the information on a timely basis.  Some you get from publications, some from online research, but it, it's helpful nevertheless, 'cause every family's search is the same.  You've got father, mother, grandparents, great-grandparents.  Some are still looking for their place with a king or a queen.  We don't worry about that.
Story_ID: 612649
Speaker 1: In terms of that, have, have you uncovered any kings and queens in, in the genealogical research?
Speaker 2: Not in my family (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Or in the Lansing Area, you know, African American Genealogical Society [Lansing Area African American Genealogical Society, Lansing, Michigan], has there been any kings or queens or big shots, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We've, we've, we've found big shots, what, what I consider big shots anyway.  One of the things that we've found out, that the, the present area where the library of, the historical library [Library of Michigan, Lansing, Michigan] is situated, a man by the name of Andrew Dungey built homes and in the same, you know, block areas.  Some of the homes are still existing.  He, he came to Lansing [Michigan] in about the late 1880s.  And remarkably, you, you can see a pattern where he is a carpenter, then a building, and a contractor, and a realtor, so that in his case, there were possibilities.  We've not been able to nail it down really good, but it may have been because of Masonic involvement.  It may have been in part of political attachment.  But you can see the increases.  At the same time, you'll find persons who were, we'll say, domestics or porters, and they remained that same status until their death.
Story_ID: 612650
Speaker 1: We've found that the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was formed in about 1862, is still in existence in the City of Lansing [Michigan] as we speak, just renamed.  But it's still the same religious body.
Speaker 2: Does the same church that was established still exist?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now, now what was the name of the church?  And--
Speaker 1: It, it was called the African Americ- African Methodist Episcopal Church.
Speaker 2: Oh, they didn't have a, a--like St. Paul's African American or, or, or, or--
Speaker 1: Not in this--
Speaker 2: --or Allens or, or nothing like that?
Speaker 1: Not, no, no, not, not until about 1900, some time--
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And it was named after a former pastor, in, in memory of him.  And it was, well, that was around 1903, '4 [1904], something like that.  Later it was changed to Trinity African Methodist Episcopal Church [Lansing, Michigan] when it was--they had to move from the location where they were, and so they renamed it when that move was made.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it's gone through three names, I guess.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: But it's, it's still basically the same church.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Remarkably, Baptist churches are, are not seen until the later 1890s.  So some African Americans went to established churches, Congregational probably, Presbyterian certainly.  And later, of course, the Seventh-day Adventist organization is formed in Michigan, and so there are others.
Story_ID: 612651
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back to Andrew Dungey.  Now this is an African American--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Andrew Dun- Dungey, who built homes in Lansing [Michigan]?  And, and when did he start doing this, or what era?
Speaker 2: It would be in the 18--between 1890 to 1920.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is--I'm tempted to think he's related to the famous Dungees that range all over America from Oklahoma to Ohio, at least, that, that I know of anyway, the, the, Tony Dungy, the famous Michigan State [sic. University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] football player and coach's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --family, same family as, is--I know he's related to Roscoe Dunjee of Oklahoma who was editor of the Oklahoma Black Dispatch [The Black Dispatch] and related to Drusilla Dunjee Houston who wrote the 'Wonderful Ethiopians of the Ancient Cushite Empire' Volume I and Volume II--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --back in the 1920s.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: These are three done--famous Dungees I know about, so.
Speaker 2: One of the problems is the spelling of the name.  Sometimes it's just G-Y; in other cases you'll find G-E-Y.  Andrew Dungey--
Speaker 1: Well, some is G-E-E.
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  But they come from the Calvin Center area of Michigan, which is the western side of, of Michigan, closer to Lake Michigan.  And to find their origins is, is, is one of the difficulties because of the spelling of the name.  But he comes from Calvin Center to Lansing about 1886 and remains here until his death in the 1950s.
Speaker 1: Now, Calvin Center is the western part of the state, as you said.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, now is, is he related to those other Dungees?  Do, do you know?  Is Andrew related to Tony Dungy and--
Speaker 2: I, I can't tell.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I cannot tell, 'cause there are Dungees who were in Canada, Buxton, Ontario [North Buxton, Canada].  There were Dungees in Calvin Center, some of whom I, I, I just, I believe they came from Virginia, but I, I can't be positive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I would imagine there'd be a lot of online research about the Dungees with, you know, a couple of famous ones still around, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which there would--a lot want to know, you know, where they--
Speaker 2: One of the, one of the pastors of the church that my wife [HistoryMaker Verna Holley] and I are from, Herbert Dungy [ph.] was his name, and they came from Canada.  I met him first in Sandwich, Ontario [Old Sandwich Town, Canada].  But you, you know, you don't--at that time it was just a name, you know.  And then later, his son, Harold [ph.], kept in touch with me.  And then I found out that his father and Tony's father [Wilbur L. Dungy], you know--and, and the spelling is the same, G-Y.  It, it, it's, it's a, it's a real struggle to find out why one group is in Buxton and the other in Calvin Center.
Speaker 1: Yeah, some in Oklahoma--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Story_ID: 612652
Speaker 1: So the Dungees are a family that can have many, many, the different spellings.  This is a classic example, 'cause we were talking--I think I was telling you on--off, when we were--we weren't on, there's an article in the Daily News [New York Daily News] about the Dungees that establish a link between one of the relatives in Dayton [Ohio] was actually that she was related to Tony Dungy, the football, football coach, who's on 'NFL Live' every Sunday--I think that's the show--and used to be the coach of the New York Jets [sic.], I think.  And the Drusilla Dunjee Houston, who is Roscoe Dunjee's daughter [sic. sister] and Roscoe Dunjee himself, and then their, their--and these spellings, you're, you're right: the spellings are D-U-N-G-E-E, D-U-N-G-E-Y, D-U-N-G-Y, you know, is the same family.  So it's--so this is where, I think--correct me if I'm wrong--I think that oral history may play a role, in terms of deter- determining, you know, how a family name changers.  For instance, in my family, C-R-O-W-E, the E was added by my grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: If you didn't know that, you would think I wasn't related to the other Crows in Kentucky--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --C-R-O-W.  I, I, I mean it's, it was suggested I know with one of our HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] meetings that we could solve the genealogical questions we have at the beginning just by doing research online, but I argued against it.  I said I don't think you can do it, because you have to have that story.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  You, you, you play a, a lot of Dick Tracy kinds of things or detective, part Perry Mason, depending on, you know, the era in which you've been raised in.  Trust what you see, validate it as best you can, and ask questions many times over until it's just either it's crystal clear or you can't avoid it.  Every family--I have one cousin I haven't been able to find, or I should, should say great aunt, haven't been able to find after she comes to Michigan.  But yet, a third cousin tells me, "Well, she died in, in Michigan."  "What year?"  "Don't know."  Yeah, but my mother [Ethel Jones Holley] knew her.  And, and, and this cousin says, "But it was after your mother died."  Okay, well, that (laughter), that gets it down to somewhere in the '70s [1970s], but I never knew her.
Speaker 1: But you have a clue now as to what era to look.  I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you can try to find her death certificate--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --if she's--if, and--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --if it's true that she died after your mother died, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.  But then the problem is, is finding what name was she under at the time of death.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it's, it's been--I, I don't, I don't waste a whole lot of time pushing after that, 'cause then it, it locks you up just on one person.

Speaker 1: What are people finding in genealogical research that's exciting, aside from discovering they're related to a king or, as, as we said, a big, big political figure or a big social figure?
Speaker 2: They may find that their parent or aunt or uncle established secure employment, established businesses, were involved, you know, with others, through their church connections sometimes, through social organizations at times.  And, and they may find in, in, in searching for information, they may find, let's say a, a driver's license or insurance thing that, that tells them information that they didn't know anything about, and they're able to use it by seeking to attach them with others.  In, in, in my family, as an example, my father [Major Holley, Sr.] always had his automobile insurance from one agency until his death, and to find out well, why.  Now, maybe they'll say the same thing about (laughter), about me and, and the wife. And be able to ask question: well, why were you part of the Michigan Educational Employees Mutual Insurance [Meemic Insurance Company]?  Well, Mrs. Holley [HistoryMaker Verna Holley] is a teacher.  Where was she a teacher?  What did she teach?  You know, it's things like that, once you, you start researching.  Or else you'll find a copy of a death certificate and see a name as, as an informant and try to figure out who were they.  Why were they an informant with a, a relative's death?  Are, are they related to me?  Were they dear friends or, or what have you?  And those are the kinds of things that are visible, but yet invisible if the, if the questions are never asked, you know, why, you know.  Sometimes you'll find the recording of a death and the circumstance of death or the condition of the patient.  And it'll tell something about the, the malady that caused their death or what they were, what they were involved in and employment sometimes.
Story_ID: 612654
Speaker 1: Here in, in Lansing [Michigan], as an example, there was one family that we were tracing, and they had several young children who, who, who never got out of infancy before death.  The family came from Canada, and Mr. Dungey and I'm, I'm sure this is because of the Masonic--the burial plot was paid for by Mr. Dungey.  So the, those are the kinds of things which help, you know, connect Alfred Taylor [ph.] and Andrew Dungey, because of the Masonic organization.  And that's been a difficult thing, somewhat, for me, because I am, I am not part of the Masonic order, and to find out their history without seeming to be nosy or, or what have you.  But then that's my own personal demeanor.  But the question is still there, you know.  They are tied in with the Masonic order here.  It started with Prince Hall Masons, and according to city directory, established in 1876.  And here are listing of names of the officers in the city directory.  Sometimes they are porters; sometimes draymen, as they say, whatever that is (laughter).
Speaker 2: A wagon driver, right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but they, they had a position of importance in the, in their community.  They may not have been thought to be important in and of themselves.
Story_ID: 612655
Speaker 1: We're tracing another family.  The mother was, for a period of years, the president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Lansing [Michigan].  I knew an individual who was a, a high school teacher when we moved to Lansing in 1970, but I knew nothing about the extended family.  She's also out of Alabama.  She worked as a custodian for, for the United Methodist church here in Lansing for a number of years.  But she's the president of the NAACP, and, and it was, it, it, it was an amazing kind of discovery when I saw her name.  It didn't have that many women who were the head for a good number of years, but she's there, yeah.
Speaker 2: Just off the top, it seems to me that a president would, of NAACP, would have to have the kind of job that he couldn't be fired, or he or she couldn't be fired from--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --because of political pressure.
Speaker 1: So that's--
Speaker 2: It might be the, the link with the church.  I don't know, but--
Speaker 1: Well, they have a room which is named after her, you know, in the church, yeah.  And basically, the congregation is all Caucasian, you know.
Speaker 2: So that may mean an alliance with the, a white congregation that--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that had--who was sympathetic to the--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --aims of the NAACP.
Speaker 1: One of the, one man who we've been able to find that was here in the 1840s, he was buried from that church.  And at the time of his death, they, they had six pallbearers, six who were black, six were Caucasian.  He's buried in Mount Hope Cemetery [Lansing, Michigan].  And at that time, you proceeded by carriage or walked.  And the newspaper article written about his funeral is very exemplary.  To me he's an important man, because the church identified themselves with his presence as well as his demise.
Story_ID: 612656
Speaker 1: What's the most I think valuable story or bit of information that you've been able to cull out of your genealogical research here in Lansing [Michigan] that you can--is there any one thing or that--
Speaker 2: I would say that I've off, off--often stated anyway that there were about six families that are the glue, either because they had multiple daughters or sons who married, you know, one another, stayed here, were either part of the African Methodist Episcopal Church [George R. Collins Memorial A.M.E. Church; Trinity African Methodist Episcopal Church, Lansing, Michigan].  That's one of the reasons why I think that particular church has lasted as long, you know, as it has, even with the three name changes.  And, and they, and they, they've, they were people of, of influence.  There's kind of like 'The Warmth of Other Suns' [Isabel Wilkerson] S-U-N-S, and maybe she did it deliberately, instead of S-O-N-S.  We need both, sons and daughters, of course, and so that they--there's reason for sticking.  Presence and the way to, to grab and display are, are important to me.  That may be the story.  I'm not going to go away.  I will survive.  And, and, and I still like you (laughter).  I'm kind of concentrating on, on one particular family.  The father comes from Virginia to Connersville, Indiana, ends up in Hart, Michigan, and then back to Lansing.  His children come with him, and they begin intermarried or, or marriage, you know, to other families, and they're still traceable here.  The, the, the one branch of the family are here in 1890.  We'll say 1891, 1892.  There's an educator by the name of Myrtle Craig [Myrtle Craig Mowbray], who went to MAC, or Michigan Agricultural College [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  There was no job offer for her in Michigan, and she ends up in Kansas at a college and was there successful educator.  And certainly there are others.  And, and I guess that's why I believe it's an important study--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to know.
Story_ID: 612657
Speaker 1: Now, is the organization planning anything special in the, in the near future?
Speaker 2: We want to celebrate the tenth anniversary (laughter).  The formal establishment was in December of 2002.  And so we want to be able to celebrate that, either this December or, or early January.  So the planning has already started for that.
Speaker 1: Okay, is somebody--are you bringing in somebody, or is it just gonna be local?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the, the, the, the present president [Jesse LaSorda] is not that leaning.  And it's, that's, and it's kind of interesting too, because he happens to be Caucasian.  And I think that's, that's a part of it.
Speaker 1: So the, you're saying a Caucasian person, a white person is a--
Speaker 2: Is, is--
Speaker 1: --is the new president (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the president.
Speaker 1: --of the Lansing African American--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Lansing Area African American--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --Genealogical Society [Lansing African American Genealogical Society, Lansing, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He, he's, he's a, an apt genealogist and was formerly married to an African American woman by the name of Dungee.  And, and that's part of how I think, or how it came about.  And it's, it's had its own sort of shaky problems, but we, we, we, we will survive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he, so he's not inclined to bring in a speaker or anything for, for the event or--
Speaker 2: That's the indication that, you know, that I received.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I hate to--I shouldn't talk about a person.
Story_ID: 612658
Speaker 1: We have veterans of the Civil War and there's more interested--more interest in getting headstones on their graves, you know, that are designated.  Now he's great on that.  He has a name too, by (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --by the way (laughter).
Speaker 2: What is his name?
Speaker 1: Sometimes names are, are not that important, but since I, I, I said it; but his name is Jesse LaSorda.  And we have good times working together on research projects, but it's almost always to find the first rather than the wider community.  And I'm not against firsts.
Speaker 2: So, so you're--okay, what you're--I'm just re- rephrasing what you said.  The, the, the concept of the first black person (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Whatever--
Speaker 2: --first African American to do this and that.
Speaker 1: Yes, that.
Speaker 2: And it's often considered history by a lot of people on the radio and the TV blitz and that sort of thing.  But--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you're saying there's lar- it's a larger context for this--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that need to be--
Speaker 1: It has to be, because you don't get to be first alone.  Somebody will always have helped to bring that about.  The first astronaut didn't just happen to be the only one.  There were others.
Speaker 2: And the implication is the first is the first to do something that white people are doing.  And--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --if we do something in our own community it's not first (laughter).  Is it as important as doing it in the--
Speaker 1: Yes, that's--
Speaker 2: It's, that's the implication that the first--
Speaker 1: Yes.  There, there's much--there were Native Americans here in the Lansing [Michigan] area before the first white family came.  They will celebrate Chief Okemos, but as--at some point in time, they were forced away.  That's not celebrated.
Speaker 2: That's not written about or, or focused on--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --you're saying, yeah.
Speaker 1: No.  They had to go somewhere.  They must have gone somewhere.  If they were assimilated into a larger group, okay.  But for some reason you can't do that with African Americans so easily.  And that's part of the reasons why we stay, we stay together as an organization, to show that there were people who were willing to take rebuffs, discouragement, states of poverty and still stay.  One man whose name was Lord Nelson Turner was a whitewasher.  It was here in the 1840s.  His wife, Priscilla [Priscilla Turner], was one of the charter members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church [George R. Collins Memorial A.M.E. Church; Trinity African Methodist Episcopal Church, Lansing, Michigan] when Reverend George Collins [George R. Collins], who the church was subsequently named after in, in memorial, he, he spoke of that particularly.  She was a laundress as a business, along with her husband being a whitewasher.  But if the industry of whitewashing is not known, it, it seems of, of little importance.  He dies in about 1890.  He may have died because of the lime that he was using to whitewash.  And, and, and now it's sometimes use derisively to say cover it up.  We can't be covered up. (Pause) That's why we stay together.
Story_ID: 612659
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, what are your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Strong children, wise minds, and see the example that has been presented to us in the political realm, in the educational realms.  We are not all Magic Johnsons.  As great as his ability has been exhibited, he's not the latest rapper; he's not Terry Furlow, you know.  An injury to a knee will wipe out athletic ability.  But you can't do that short of Alzheimer's getting into the mind and blotting it out.  So, we still have to stick to it and go get it.  We're important to everybody in the United States of America, because we didn't ask to come here.  But once we arrived, we adapted and used the, the culture and, and, and to learn the language and then exhibit thought.  The wife [HistoryMaker Verna Holley] and I will be involved later this week with a recital.  And they, they, they asked me to be the narrator.  And at first I was somewhat reluctant.  But the thoughts still came, that when you're, you're brought to an alien culture, a foreign language, and you're able to learn it and then convey ideas and thoughts and purpose, that, that's a unique person.  If you cannot speak a foreign language, then you have to adapt some, some borderline ability to say I don't understand everything you're saying to me, but this is what I think I hear you saying.  And if there is congruence with that, then we can communicate with one another.  And that, that's, that's a, a thing of, of saying my history is your history.  If you, if you turn that around, you're history is my history, then you've got to explain where the problems lie, 'cause my history (laughter) is contained in your history, you know, whether it's family to family, group to group.  And so that's, again, what we seek to do, you know, even today with, with family histories.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So everything kind of radiates out, self, family, community, area, nation.
Speaker 2: Nation, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 612660
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point in life, and I know you retired from the government in '93 [1993], right?  Well, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Pause) That's a difficult question.  The things that you attempt to do or to display and the things that you work the hardest at to accomplish usually is what's considered legacy.  (Pause) I don't know why that's, it's difficult to even form words.  You know, it's like, like a tombstone (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, maybe I, I, I ask you another question first, and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay. All right.
Speaker 1: --we'll get back to it.  It's not the last question.  Don't, don't think it's the last one I'm gonna ask.  But, but we, we ask this question, well, a similar question, just looking back the other way.  Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there anything that you would go back and change or do different if you could?
Speaker 2: No, I would- I would not.  I, I would try to even accelerate even more of the things I've done.  Partly and, and it may be not only educationally, religiously, socially, organizations and institutions that I've been a part of, I've always attempted to do not only the best that I can but something that others would be proud of.  With, without me even knowing, they, they think that way.  Sometimes it might be expressed.  But I mean when a young couple says to the wife [HistoryMaker Verna Holley] and I that you were our model, it's always somewhat, makes you feel uneasy, because I, I might think that I'm displaying a certain thing, and they're seeing something else.  But I would want them to know, whatever it was, there was no sidestepping.  It was the best, you know, that I could do.
Story_ID: 612661
Speaker 1: Legacy will have to be part of the history that somebody else has to write about.  I guess I'm, I'm writing it without putting it down on paper, yeah, or even if it's in paper form or written form, what they think of it.  If, if it raises them, enlightens them, causes them to have a, a view of, of a spiritual life, and educational life, a social life, that's, that's important to me.
Story_ID: 612662
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit about your family.  Now you, you have, you have grown children, I take it, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  We, we have three children, two boys, one girl, all, all adult children of course.  Our oldest son [Mark Holley] just graduated with his bachelor's of arts degree after many years.  And he did say to me, "I made it just like you did," he says.  He's, he's, he has worked, you know, with me in various things.  He, he has his own life.  Some things were, were shaky for me, but he's still my son.  Our second child [Timothy Holley] was a son also.  He's, is a associate professor of music at North Carolina Central University down in Durham, North Carolina, a cellist and very accomplished young man, married.  We have two granddaughters.  Our youngest child is a daughter, Millicent [Millicent Holley], who is, was, is, was trained as a, a pathologist assistant and is presently working at University of Michigan hospital [University of Michigan Medical Center] in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Very close, demeanor somewhat similar to my own.  Other family members will say that she is like me.  I don't know what that means, she, but she's a lot of fun; actually, all, all three of our children, a lot of fun.  They like to collect money sometimes, but that's, that's still great.  I have a dear wife [HistoryMaker Verna Holley].  She just told me last week, "You know, I've been eating breakfast with you for a long time."  And we intend to keep on doing that.  Presently, we've been married fifty-five years.  The extended family, because of the accumulation of age, (background noise) we've lost two of my siblings, both my older brothers.  The oldest was a jazz musician, bassist, and died about 1990.  Major [Major Holley, Jr.] was his name.  Then my second brother, Harold [Harold Holley], who died because of accumulated substance abuse and then encountered cancer of throat, but he was a musician nevertheless and very helpful in his way to the collection of family knowledge.
Speaker 1: So music runs in the family.  We probably knew this back in 2007, but, but now--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) it seems, seems like it's new to me.  But music certainly runs in the family I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what did this brother play?
Speaker 2: He played the bass also.
Story_ID: 612663
Speaker 1: As children, my father [Major Holley, Sr.], he--with them, he wanted them to be educated.  The last four children in our family, after my father's conversion, we were in the church.  We had to be educated at, in the, and in the church.  So it's been an interesting experience.  The weekend conference that we were involved with (cough)--with was a religious conference, which it just seems natural to me, you know, 'cause that's what I've always done.  The wife [HistoryMaker Verna Holley] is the president of the group.
Speaker 2: Now, now what, what denomination is it?
Speaker 1: Well, actually, we're nondenominational in, in our early, you know, upbringing, and so we've, we've maintained that.  We tried to reach all because the ministries that we've been involved in have always been Christ centered and, and beyond denomination purposely, because we believe you, you read the Bible, and, and it, it should be, it should be able to be understood the same way by everyone who reads it.  You know, there might be some shadings and things that they like to attach to it or take away from it, but that's, that's up to them (laughter).  They can't change what's, what's written.  And I guess that's, that's, again, what I was maybe trying say before.  Whether we write it in book form or we live it out before people, they ought to be able to read it and, and decide.
Story_ID: 612664
Speaker 1: I do have a fascinating family.  My oldest sister [Sophia Holley] is still living and taught in the Detroit Public Schools [Detroit Public Schools Community District] for fifty-six years.  She taught German.  She was a biologist.  And when the principal of the high school decided they weren't going to have the teaching of German any longer, she just switched over because she had a degree in biology and stuck out another three, four years just because she knew they were trying to force her out, because of, you know, her age.  She's still going (laughter).  One sister [Mary Holley] worked for the postal service [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] for a good number of years, living down now in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The sister [Jessie Holley] who is most nearest to me, birthed after me, was a vocal music teacher in Oberlin, Ohio.  And my youngest sister [Thelma Holley], because of health, worked in administrative and secretarial things for different organizations like the Goodwill [Goodwill Industries International, Inc.], and most recently, there's a food program down in the Detroit [Michigan] or Southfield [Michigan] area that she worked for.  She's going through a particular challenge now because my brother-in-law has developed a form of dementia, and so she's had to work with, with him a great deal.  In that sense, we're, we're closer.  And I've, I missed one brother [Oscar Holley], 'cause he's still alive.  He's a funeral director, or was a funeral director in Detroit for forty-two years, now retired.  He still thinks of himself as a funeral director of course.  And I've, I've, I've been struggling to get him to use the computer, because he knows things, because there's five years difference in our age.  He knows things that I don't know about our family.  But he's good with, what I consider, trivial stories, not--you know, the, the type of info that makes an interesting read.
Speaker 2: Do you think he might record your, your family members' stories, your brothers and sisters especially?
Speaker 1: No, he won't.  Sometimes it's, it's, it's difficult to get him to talk.  He recently lost his wife, and he, he's still kind of grinding through that.  Interestingly, we went to a funeral, the wife [HistoryMaker Verna Holley] and I, when a, a niece passed away.  And all of the people that we have known in the forty years that he's been in the funeral business, he doesn't know them like we do.  And so while we were sitting at the funeral he kept punching my rib, rib. "Who is that?  Who is that?" Because they would greet both of us, you know, so openly and with enthusiasm.  And, and it's like saying I want them to know who I am the same way.  But with, with him they're very formal because they don't know him as such.
Speaker 2: So what was the, what's, what's the name of his, what was the name of his funeral home?
Speaker 1: Fields--
Speaker 2: Fields.
Speaker 1: --Funeral Home [Fields Funeral Home, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a different--I, I know in Ohio you're--the, the home has to have the name of the proprietor, you know.  So if it's Bowen, a guy named Bowen runs it, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and so forth.  But, but here you can have a name, another name--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So is, did his children carry it on?
Speaker 1: He had no children.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: And so it's just nieces and nephews, you know, that--you know, he'd, he'd want to harvest them, but he's their uncle, you know, not their father.  And he, he is a, a, a arro- very arrogant fellow and very opinionated.  And, and so we, we have to embrace him, you know.  It, it is interesting.  He would call me when he gets an email and can't open it because he won't follow instructions.  And I kiddingly told him, I said, "What happened to that, that guy who was always so sharp and a go getter?  What happened to him?"  Well, he never answered me, so I, I guess he doesn't think that's who he is today.
Speaker 2: Or maybe he'll get, you know, computer literate and start--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It, it's, it's fun in, in a way.
Story_ID: 612665
Speaker 1: We went to a family reunion down in Alabama.  He had driven my father [Major Holley, Sr.] and mother [Ethel Jones Holley] down there about 1965, '64 [1964] or '65 [1965].  And he had these pictures.  And so he says, "I'm gonna take them with me."  And this is the first time that he'd gone to one of the family reunions down there.  He didn't know who the people in the picture were except my mother and father and himself.  And it was just amazing to see him kind of blossom in a way to, to, in showing these pictures.  Now the children, the, the little guys who were children, he has no idea which family that they're a part of 'cause basically it's two families, Joneses and Hicks [ph.].  But he couldn't tell them by name who they were, because we've seen them on a, you know, every two years.  We've, we've known them as children and as adults.
Speaker 2: So were they ever identified?  I mean--
Speaker 1: Oh yes, you know, yeah.  He look, he looked at one picture, you know, and he thought--one, one of the sons happened to be the pastor of Church of God [Third Street Church of God] there in Greensboro [Alabama].  He looked at him, and he said, "That's, that's, that's me."  No, it was his father.  You know, all, all he had to do is do the math (laughter), just add the years between '65 [1965] to his present age, which he doesn't tell anyone what his age is, but we know--couldn't have been you.  His father is ninety, you know, and presently.  And so you just subtract that off.  You know, he had been in his thirties, you know, and that's not too current (laughter).  But he, you know, he's tall, slender like his father.  But, but my brother, Oscar [Oscar Holley], he, he learned a, a great deal just with that trip after so many years, you know, that family is important, and you have to keep up with them, and you have to invest something in order to do it.  Whether it time or dollars, you've got to invest it, yes.  So that's, that's my family.
Story_ID: 612666
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think, I don't think so.  We, we've covered a good number of years, unless I tell you about the Cuban Missile Crisis (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, did you tell us about that last time?
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't think you did--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: There's a story related to the Cuban Missile Crisis you want to tell us?
Speaker 2: It's a story with, as far as our family is concerned.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: At the time it kicked off we were in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is nineteen sixty--
Speaker 2: In '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: --two [1962], yeah.
Speaker 2: We were in, at Fort Bliss, Texas, just outside of El Paso, Texas.  The night that it--well, as far as I'm concerned, it kicked off, there were B-52s [Boeing B-52 Stratofortress] and at that time, KC-97 tankers [Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter], and they were taking off on parallel runways.  And usually you might hear two or four planes, but never continuous, you know, aircraft taking off.
Speaker 1: Now this, now you were hearing them from what, what vantage point?  Where were you when this was--
Speaker 2: I was in El Paso at Fort Bliss--
Speaker 1: Okay, Fort Bliss.
Speaker 2: --Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Biggs Field [Biggs Army Airfield] was the adjacent airbase next to Fort Bliss.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were taking off, and most of the planes, later I learned, were going to Dyer Air Force Base [sic. Dyess Air Force Base, Texas].
Speaker 1: Where's Dyer in--
Speaker 2: Dyer's in, in--I'm not a, I'm not certain exactly what city it's, it's near, but it's--well, Texas is so big, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it's in Texas?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  They had already built Nike anti-air, air defense sites.  You know, it's just rough, but they were there.  And, and I didn't, I didn't know that until just the other day, when they showed a, a picture of one of the missile bodies.  And I said boy, that looks familiar, you know.  And then when they did a long shot of it, yeah, I can see the booster, you know, detached back, but it didn't have the warhead on it.  That's what I saw the next morning, because there were railroad cars loaded with military equipment going out of Fort Bliss.  Later is when they announced that there was a crisis and that they were gonna confront the Soviet bringing missiles into Cuba.  They were gonna--well, they were either gonna stop them on the high sea, or they were gonna stop them, whatever.  And that made sense after hearing so many planes taking off.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you heard the planes tak- taking off before you knew the rest of the story.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And we were down there in a military status, you see.  And I didn't know whether they would take me away and leave my wife [HistoryMaker Verna Holley] and children.  Or at that time, we just had the two boys [Mark Holley and Timothy Holley].  So it, it, it became scarier until I knew that I would not be included, you know, yeah, because I was a, a guardsman.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: So I don't, I don't know--I mean I (laughter) said anything about that (simultaneous). But I can talk about it at fifty years later.

Speaker 1: Now the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  And in your case, I thought I'd ask it in the sense that--the question is how would you like to be remembered?  But you're a person.  You're a genealogist, and you look at, at things that people have left behind all the time, and you're looking for certain things.  So, so in that context I guess, like, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I, I guess as a--I hate to say pseudo scholar--a scholarly person who wanted other families to know themselves.  I think that's probably the best way.  One of the things I liked about the book, 'The Warmth of Other Suns' [Isabel Wilkerson] was how she handled both triumph and, and defeat within the families that she chose.  The one man who became--because he had to run away from the Florida picking fields, ends up as a deacon and singer.  But he was willing to confront growers who would not pay the workers.  And because of the threat of death, he had to leave.  But he established himself in Chicago [Illinois] and, and did not go back until the, the death of, you know, the, the one family member that really required him to be there, and sang.  So I, I think that's it, you know.  I thought I was doing it right before.  I believe I'm doing it right now, you know.  So that, that's, that's for me.

Speaker 1: This photo is of myself and my father.  His name was Major Quincy Holley [Major Holley, Sr.].  And it's taken about 1950.  Of interest, he, he was, he had been trained as, as a molder in a foundry in Detroit [Michigan] and became ill because of the, the breathing in of silicon dust from the foundries.  And, and later, of course, that was what caused his death.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of my mother and father, Major Quincy Holley and Ethel Lee Holley [Ethel Jones Holley], with my oldest brother, Major Quincy Holley, Jr. [Major Holley, Jr.].  And this was taken in--near his birth in 1925, or after his birth in 1925.  He actually was born in '24 [1924].
Speaker 1: This is a photograph of myself just prior to graduation from Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan] in 1976.
Speaker 2: A photograph of myself in uniform as a chief warrant officer for the Michigan Army National Guard.
Speaker 1: This photograph I probably was seventeen years of age, ready to graduate from high school [Cass Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan].
