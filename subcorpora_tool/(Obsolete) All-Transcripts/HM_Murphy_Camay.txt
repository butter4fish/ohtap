Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five People magazine--ish type questions, lightweight questions that we ask and they just require a brief answer.  The first one is, ma'am, what is your favorite food.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 178192
Speaker 1: Tell me now what, now what do you know about your family history?  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side and your father's side.  And can you give us your parents' full names and spell them for us, and their dates and places of birth?
Speaker 2: Their dates and places of birth?  I don't know whether I can give dates of my mother.  Okay.  My mother's name was Zelma, Z-E-L-M-A, Proctor, P-R-O-C-T-O-R.  And her birth date was June 3rd.  And she was born in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father's name was Cabell, C-A-B-E-L-L, Calloway, C-A-L-L-O-W-A-Y.  And he was born December twenty-fifth--what--I don't know the year.  I think it was, I think it was like in, in early part of the nineteenth century.  So I'm, I'm--I mean to--of the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The last part of the (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --of the twentieth century.  Yeah.  Right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--(simultaneous) early. Okay.
Speaker 2: Early nineteen-hundreds. Rochester, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was born in Rochester, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, tell us about your mother's side of the family.  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: My mother's side of the family, the Proctors, I think they were, were in like construction business, in early construction business in Baltimore.  And they were somewhat in the music business because my grandfather I saw a picture of him with a--sort of what they called the piccolo.  He used to play a piccolo in a band.  The Proctors are kind of well-known in Baltimore.  I think they were freemen--freed slaves at one point because they were very clannish and there was talk of the intermarriage and that kind of thing.  But I think they're --they are known sort of to have lived in Baltimore, in, in Maryland and also in Delaware.  There's some Proctors that are known in Delaware.
Speaker 1: Are, are you related to Henry Proctor Slaughter, the book collector?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure. Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: He's a famous book collector from this area that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I'm not sure that a--that I am.  They were also in cabling business.  Some--one of the Proctors, I think,--well, talking about book collector, one of the Proctors was--lived in Washington, D.C. and he was one of the first blacks in the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.].  One of the first black librarians in the Library of Congress.  And so there may be that connection.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was a Henry Proctor Slaughter that was great friends with Arthur Schomburg and Jesse Moorland.  He was a book collector and he's written about books at the Moorland-Spingarn Collection [Research Center, Howard University, Washington, D.C.] published on black bibliophiles and collectors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Henry Proctor Slaughter.  His last name was Slaughter.
Speaker 1: Slaughter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was--well Proctor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I--as far I know their work was in education, in, in catering, and in construction.  Uncle Johnny Proctor was like a house painter.  And he did a lot of painting of various houses and whatnot in Baltimore.  They say he had an artistic bent, but that's stretching it (laughter).  But anyway, they were fair skinned people.  That's, I think--was sort of part of this intermarriage.  Keeping the, keeping everyone light skinned.  That was part of, I think, of culture some time ago.  That the, the idea was to lighten the race and--
Speaker 2: So if you were already light you were trying to find a mate that was light?
Speaker 1: That was light.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: That was kind of their--their--I guess objective in the Proctor clan, to keep everybody kind of light.  "Good hair" they called it, you know, to keep your hair--to marry somebody that has kind of straight hair or hair that was more like a white person.  And so they--that's--that's what they did.  I don't know of any, you know, judges or lawyers or that kind of thing that came out of the Proctor family.  I think they were more like workers at the--at the mid-management level.
Story_ID: 178193
Speaker 1: My mother was the daughter of Sam Proctor.  And her mother was Viola Brown.  And she was a beautician.  And she--my grandmother worked for Bertha Poindexter [ph.].  Who had a beauty shop here in Baltimore [Maryland] on Druid Hill Avenue.  And she was almost--Bertha Poindexter was almost comparable to Madam [C.J.] Walker, but she was here in Baltimore.  In fact, I found when was looking over some things a formula that Bertha Poindexter had for making hair pomade.  And it was very--it's--it was very interesting that she had developed this formula, probably with someone else.  But she was well known for a--something that they did in those days to make hair grow.  It was almost like a wand that had a purple light in it and they would put it on, you know, all over the people's heads.  Whether it did anything or not--but people believed--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Did it work?
Speaker 1: (laughter)--people felt as though it was going to make your hair grow.  And, of course, in those days very--not-just, certainly not as we have it today, black people wanted long hair.  And so they--they would flock to her.  And I think she made a lot of money from that, from that type of business.  My mother was interested in nursing and she went to New York [New York] and went to Lincoln Hospital to get training in nursing.  She didn't graduate.  She could not handle cadavers.  And so I guess they kind of kicked her out and got rid of her.  But she did do, sort of, in-home nursing and worked at it for--for a while in her, in her thing.  My mother and father were not married when I was born.  And, in fact, they never married.  And so I lived with her [Murphy's grandmother, Viola Brown] and with a--at this Poindexter Beauty Salon, which was a house above the salon here in Baltimore, when I was small.  And then I joined my--my mother was up in New York and remarried and then I moved up to New York with her.
Story_ID: 178194
Speaker 1: My father [Cab Calloway] was young, when I was born.  He was about eighteen, nineteen.  And I think just sort of starting on his career.
Speaker 2: Was your mother [Zelma Proctor] about the same age, or--
Speaker 1: Yes.  No my, my mother was about sixteen when I was born.  He was about nineteen.  And so they sort of start--he, he was just, you know, beginning in his career.  And then he left Baltimore [Maryland] and went to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Now this is the famous Cab Calloway?
Speaker 1: This is the famous Cab Calloway.
Speaker 2: In those days a superstar, equivalent with any of your superstars today.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So he was just starting out?
Speaker 1: But, yeah.  But he was just starting out.  And he was sent by his mother--well they -- well anyway, when they found out that my mother was pregnant by him.  He didn't deny anything or whatever.  She was sent to New York [New York].  Because in those days you--it was a disgrace really to find yourself in that predicament.  And she was very, genteel type of woman.  And she, I think, did not tell anybody until really the last minute or they just saw, you know, she was pregnant.  So she was sent to New York.  He was sent to Chicago to his sister and with the idea that he was going to law school out in Chicago, 'cause his father was like a lawyer/real estate person.  And so he, instead of really going to law school, because Blanche [Calloway], was in show business at that time, he sort of started fooling around with her in the clubs and playing drums.  He was a drummer and singer.  And so he was doing some things in the--in the performance area in Chicago.  And was noticed as being very high energy.  A good voice because he had had voice lessons when he attended [Frederick] Douglass High School here in Baltimore [Maryland].  And he was just a--sort of a, a charismatic personality that I think people began to recognize.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And so he started getting gigs and finally he got a band, The Missourians.  That band was sort of turned over to him.  And--
Speaker 2: --It was your aunt, who was Blanche, who was the--who was in entertainment before--
Speaker 1: That's right.  She was--
Speaker 2: --Your father--
Speaker 1: --she was in--she was in entertainment before he was.  In fact, she was in Eubie Blake's 'Shuffle Along.'  She didn't go on stage in 'Shuffle Along,' she was too young.  But she sang off stage.  What they did then was they had people with good voices to sing off stage and they had some people on stage to make it sound like a huge crowd of, you know, like many, many, voices.
Speaker 2: Now they have a recorder they turn on.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Now, they have a recorder.  Yeah.  So, so anyway she--yeah, she sort of reluctantly, I think, taught him the tricks of the trade.  And because he seemed, just seemed determined to go on with this career rather than the law.  So anyway he--after he got the band and after he sort of started traveling with the band, and took Duke Ellington's place at the Cotton Club [New York, New York], he became a really--a great sensation.
Speaker 2: Gee whiz he took Duke Ellington's place at the Cotton Club?  He was--sounds like he was already a sensation on some level--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, it was very interesting because it would--there--they tell the story, I mean he told, he told the story, you never know what--how these stories are true or whatever.  But the Cotton Club was owned by the mob.  And they would go around and listen to bands and go to the--to other places and find talent that they wanted at the club, that they felt would be good at the club.  So evidently someone saw him and identified him and he said some of the people came and said, you know, "This is an offer you can't refuse," or something.  And he--Duke Ellington, had an opportunity at that time to go to Europe, it's sort of his first trip to Europe.  And he had been in the Cotton Club, so he couldn't turn it down.  And he--he asked if he could be relieved of that gig to go to Europe.  And so they put in my father in his place.  But it was--he said that it was a time that even the musician, was still kind of told, you know, you do this, you do that.  And the mob was kind of footing the bill and calling the shots really, to a large degree
Speaker 2: So the mob basically determined what, how much he made and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and when he would perform and--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --a lot of other things.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But he worked his way out of that, that kind of arrangement, and was able to get a regular manager and agent and work wherever he wanted to work.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So eventually, he got of that situation--
Speaker 1: Yes.  He eventually got out of the situation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 178195
Speaker 1: Where did your parents [Zelma Proctor and Cab Calloway] meet?  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Well, they were both in--at--in [Frederick] Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland] together.  And my father was considered, you know, very handsome.  He was sort of like a hustler type of guy, so he always had money and, you know, in his pocket.  He was one of the first kids to have a car at--they tell the story that they had an assembly at Douglass and they were saying the principal made his statement would the teacher who left his car--left their car in front of the school, please move the car across the street or something, but you can't park in front of the school.  And he--my father, gets up and walks up the aisle to move his--it's his car.  And the principal wasn't too happy about that, because at that time high school students just did not have cars.
Speaker 1: So his father was fairly well off and was a lawyer and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --real estate developer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Right. But he worked.  He sold papers.  He worked down at the race track.  He walked horses.  That was sort of his early introduction into the racing.  Which was one of his loves all through his life.  And then he played, you know, in these little pickup bands and whatnot around in Baltimore [Maryland].  So he was, he was kind of independent and, and sought after and popular and whatnot.  And my mother was very attractive, genteel kind of little girl.  And I guess she was really amazed that he kind of went for her.  So as I said, she was living on Druid Hill Avenue [Baltimore, Maryland] and so they got together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was one of those things.
Story_ID: 178196
Speaker 1: You basically grew up in New York [New York] then right?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And then you spent summers in Baltimore [Maryland], visiting.  Now you had two aunts that you visited, Aunt Bernice [Calloway]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I read that you said that she was a more siddity than the other aunt, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Aunt Bernice was always trying to hold up, you know, the past history of the family.  And to sort of--she didn't--she liked classical music.  She didn't like anything that was a little bit what they used to call in those days "low life".  She was married to a Morgan [State] University professor.  And--and she was a chiropodist.  But she didn't practice that much.  I think she trained in Chicago [Illinois] in the School of Chiropody [formerly Illinois College of Chiropody, later Dr. William M. Scholl College of Podiatric Medicine, North Chicago, Illinois] out there.  And so anyway she--and she was in charge of the cotillion here in Baltimore.  She was kind of a flamboyant type person.  Good dresser and lots of jewelry and very outstanding, I think, in--in the social cut type of thing. And both Cab and Blanche, I think, were more kind of, you know, regular folk, down home, kind of thing.  You know he liked chitterlings and stuff like that, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And so, she was just trying to keep--keep everybody uplifted.  I think every family probably has someone there that's--that's trying to set a goal for the family.  That's little bit either by--through religion or through social standing or something that their dissatisfied with the majority of the people of the family and trying to lift them up a little bit. But that was Aunt Bernice.
Speaker 1: So he had what--I guess it goes against the stereotype that people have of their being one kind of person, another kind of person, but in the same kind of family you can have a lot of different types and I guess objectives in terms of how one should comport themselves or whatever.
Speaker 2: Right, right
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 178197
Speaker 1: And show business was not--at the time that my father [Cab Calloway] came around--that was not kind of an accepted occupation so to speak for African Americans.  I mean now it's big, big and it grew to be very accepted because you were making money and living well and this kind of thing.  But it was sort of on the same thing like with number backers or somebody that was getting money in--in not too--in the--I suppose, in the accepted way.  Which should have been teacher, doctor, lawyer, business person.  Those were the people that were considered in society.  They were the ones who were in the clubs, and in, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Could that--do you think it's because that if you had aspirations in music, chances are you'd have a chance to express them in a club--in a night club or that kind of setting rather than in a concert hall?
Speaker 1: Uh-hum
Speaker 2: Did those places, those concert halls and so forth being banned basically which means black folks being banned from those?
Speaker 1: Well, they had--
Speaker 2: --if you were a musician, you probably most likely expressed it in a--in popular culture, in church or--
Speaker 1: In popular culture, yeah.  Well, there were concerts in churches.  They were concerts in people's homes.  People had large homes and they would have Sunday afternoon concerts and whatnot.  The--I suppose the very, very talented people were in choral groups.  And those choral groups traveled around like the Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] [Hampton Singers]--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)[Fisk] Jubilee Singers [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: --Jubilee Fisk, Jubilee Singers, etc.  And so they--they traveled in those groups.  I think Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] always had a choir of some type that traveled around.  And--and that was kind of an accepted--those folks who were in that, in that milieu were very accepted.  People who were in nightclubs, performing in small theaters, at the Royal Theater [Baltimore, Maryland] and that kind of thing.  Plus in those days you really had to travel a lot.  I mean, if you were in show business you had to go from town to town virtually to make a living.  There was no--if you were in New York, you could put--there are probably about four or five large theaters that you could, but other than that you had to be on the road.
Speaker 2: So I suppose now, being around liquor and gambling and that sort of thing and traveling, you know, kind of disrupts family life, you can't really--
Speaker 1: Right.  Plus the music itself.  There was--people, find it hard to believe, but there were certain aspects of the black culture that did not accept the blues.  That was not considered a good music for anybody to sing, perform, or be around.  Jazz was, you know, accepted by most of the people.  Certain--and certain jazz artists were accepted by the majority of the people.  But my father [Cab Calloway] was very dependent on white audiences, especially on Jewish audiences.  And when he traveled in the South, he played primarily to white audiences in the South.
Speaker 2: In the South?
Speaker 1: In the South.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And he didn't--and most of the--and then when he got very popular and expensive, most of the black theaters, or groups in the South, could not afford his fee.  And he had to pay all these guys who were traveling with him.  So he could not afford to play at the smaller venues.  He had to have a pretty good size venue and be getting a fairly good fee to perform.  He--those were very hard times because there was no place to stay.  In some small towns where, you know, there were just no blacks living in the town at all, they had to sometimes sleep in the cars or if they were traveling by train, sleep on the train etc.  So he--it was not a--an easy situation.
Story_ID: 178198
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about growing up.  Now, when you were growing up, I guess your father's [Cab Calloway] career is at its height or pretty much was approaching its height if not--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at its height.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But--but tell us about growing up.  Some of the sights and sounds in growing up in New York [New York] and in Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 2: Well, in growing up I was--I was living with my mother [Zelma Proctor].  And my father would come by to see us when, you know, he--when he was in New York or off the road and whatnot.  I was always kind of a serious-- I would-I don't want to say intellectual kid, but I liked books.  I was always in the library.  I was in the English club.  I was on the school news on--in both junior high school and high school.  I was on the school newspaper and wrote for the school magazine etc.  So I was pretty much into books.  And going to school in New York in those days was quite different from, I think, the way it is now.  It was a very competitive atmosphere.
Speaker 1: Now, what school did you attend in New York when you--(unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I attended elementary school P. S. 146 [Anna M. Short School, New York, New York].  I attended [Edward W.] Stitt Junior High School, [I.S.] 164 [New York, New York].  I attended Morris High School [New York, New York], which is the same high school that [HM] Colin Powell attended in the Bronx [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And then I attended--I was accepted for Hunter College [of The City University of New York; New York, New York].  And I went a year to Hunter College and then I went out to California with my father.  And when I came back I went to NYU [New York University, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Now, let's backtrack a little bit-
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and just tell us what your neighborhood was like when you were growing up.  What were the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I was living on a 149th Street [New York, New York].  A slanted street and a kind of a nice area when you'd go into the--to the thing.  You had to get your mail out of a little mailbox thing downstairs.  And take it up to the apartment.  There were fire escapes.  People sat out on the fire escapes in the summertime.  Kids played in the street.  We--not a lot of cars in the streets, so you played stickball.  We used to play some kind of ball that you hit it up against the wall and, you know, hit it into other person's box and then they'd hit it into your box.  A lot of city kind of street games, jumping rope.  In the wintertime we used to--somebody, wasn't me, somebody would steal sweet potatoes from the Italian grocer and we would go over to the lot and put 'em in--in the ashes and eat the hot sweet potatoes on the lot sometimes in the winter.  We--people went to the parks a lot and we would just run through the parks.  There were a lot of--New York has--it has a lot of rock, boulders and stuff like that.  So we would be running around the park and hiding behind the boulders and playing all kinds of games.  I--you'd almost spend the full Saturday in the movies.  The--you would get prizes to go to the movies.  You'd get glasses or you'd get a dish or you'd get a--you'd get something to come--to come into the movies.  And the movies would start at about ten o'clock in the morning.  And you could stay there until about six.  You would think nothing of seeing a movie twice.  It was, it was almost like a playground.  People running up and down the aisles.  A lot of noise with kids and--and a lot of cartoons, Pathe News, et cetera.  So I think that kind of experience sort of put you in a kind of--at least with me, it put me in a kind of a fantasy world.  And so you always kind of when you weren't in the movies you were kind of thinking about what you saw, and how you could be in it and will I ever be as beautiful as whoever you saw in the movies.  And you would kind of--I would kind of act out or fantasize a lot of the things that we saw in the movies.
Story_ID: 178199
Speaker 1: Were the theaters segregated now when you went to--
Speaker 2: No.  But the neighborhoods were fairly segregated.
Speaker 1: So, you were probably--
Speaker 2: So most of the people in my--
Speaker 1: --black neighborhood?
Speaker 2: --building were black, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were other kids, especially at that time which was sort of the beginning of the World War II and people--there were a lot of immigrants coming into New York [New York] trying to escape the hardships that were going in Germany and Poland and those areas.  So we had a lot of, we had a large immigrant population.  And many of those immigrants had lived in the black areas because, I think, some of those areas the rents were cheaper than they were in the white section of New York.  So they--so that you--we had within our building, you might have a couple of the immigrant families that would--that lived there.  My mother was married to a guy, Ralph Fendersen [ph.], who worked for the post office.  And so most of the people in those buildings were pretty much at that level.  You know, postal workers were considered--that was a pretty good job.  That was considered a pretty good job.  Or they were teachers or they were people who worked for the City, in one way or the other.  So we had a very--a pretty nice population.  You played on the roof a lot.  You would go up to the roof because if you washed your clothes in your apartment, sometimes you could hang--they had these lines that would go from one place like from your house over to another building and then you could put your clothes on those little pulley, pulley lines.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But sometimes people would go up to hang their clothes out on the roof and I remember the first time I ever--my mother went up to the roof, I went up with her to help her to do--put up the clothes.  I guess I was about eight or nine years old.  I saw a praying mantis on the roof.  You know I was just catatonic.  I was just stunned.  I didn't know what this thing was.  I had never seen it before.  It was just as if I saw something dropped down from space.  My mother didn't know what it was.  I remember we had those wooden clothes pins and we kept throwing these clothes pins at it, but we never quite hit it.  And it--the clothes pins didn't seem to bother it.  It just kept moving in this, you know, how a praying mantis moves in this funny, slow motion way.  And we were screaming and calling to people--it was, you know, it was really weird.  And so finally someone came upstairs and said, "That's just an insect, it's called praying mantis."  And I mean the thing was, you know, about that big, but we were just petrified.  But I do remember that--that incident with that praying mantis.  New York, I think, has always been an exciting city.  No matter where you live in New York it's something kind of going on, people moving around in the streets.  People yelling in and out.  You--we would have this--you have these places where the apartments were round and sort of in between that you had this vacuum of sound so that if you yelled out those--into that courtyard kind of thing you'd get this loud echo and louds--loud sounds.  Kids used to do that, you know, sometime, yelling back and forth.  We had telephones.  If someone lived in another building we would make a string telephone.  And if you put it on a string and pull the string you could talk in the thing.  It--
Speaker 1: A couple of cans on the ends?
Speaker 2: --never worked.  Cans on the end.  It really didn't work.  We pretended that it worked.  But it never really worked.  I think people were fairly inventive and kids played games that now you realize that those games were learning type of games, but at the time you didn't realize it.  Jackstones, you know, you played Threesies, Foursies which was really multiplying the numbers.  Picking up those numbers and what those amounts were, were really kind of important.  You played hopscotch on the street and that was another number type of game.  You had to add your--your thing at the end.  You played jump rope.  And you played Double Dutch.  And in Double Dutch you had to count by elevens, twenty-two.  No--no.  You counted by ten from eleven you started out you went twenty-two, thirty-two, forty-two, fifty-two.  So that--that was a way of counting by tens and I think that was helpful to kids.

Speaker 1: --In general you got a very good--I got a very good education in New York [New York].  I was put into a, what was then a kind of gifted talented class.  I was--I didn't know how--how it really got--I was, I did not have the IQ [intelligence quotient] that most of the kids had in that class.  But I was a pretty good writer.  And the class was devoted to a newspaper.  The whole class was turned into a newspaper, the people who were reporters, the people who were editors.  There were people who just sold the newspapers to the other classes.
Speaker 2: How do you know you didn't have the IQ?  Did they tell you?  Did them you--(unclear)(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was a--you had to have an IQ of I think 120.  And all of the--and the people who--who they identified just from their general ability in the little tests from the weekly tests and whatnot, they tested you.  You had an IQ test. And I don't think I was up to a 120.  I think it was a 118 or something like that.  But they said that--that they were the beginning, you know, the minimum was 120 but they took me into it anyway.  And it was like a very--you spent--we spent like four days a week at the [American] Museum of Natural History [New York, New York].  And one day at school.  And that day was test day.  So that you were required--I was about in fifth grade--you were required to do everything that you had to do in a very compressed time.  And it was--it has sort of shaped, I think, those experiences that I had at that time, really kind of shaped my life, really kind of made me much more of a thinker, a person that had a variety of interests.  And sort of, I think, I found out a lot about myself from that experience when I was about ten or eleven years old.  So then when I went on to junior high school, that-it was a brand new school, [Edward W.] Stitt Junior High School [I.S. 164] up on a 164th Street [New York, New York].  And we moved from class to class at that time.  And I had struck up a friendship with a girl, Alena Jurally [ph.] who was a Greek girl.  Her mother couldn't speak any English at all.  But this girl was very, very smart.  And she--she and I sort of became a team and we took --her idea was take all the hard classes, you know, do--if we had an opportunity to take electives, you know, she would want to take something like Latin Five or something--something or other.  And I really didn't want to do this, but because I was--because we were so close, I was pushed into some of these higher level types of classes.  And then when I went to--and then the same thing happened to me when I went to high school.  There was girl called Eileen Cline [ph.], who was a very good friend of mine and she would say, "Oh, yeah.  "We want a take French Four."  And I'd say "Look I barely got of French Three whatever, you know."  "No, no.  We've got to go on to French Four and then--then when you take the region for that you're sure to get into Hunter [College High School, New York, New York]."  I was really aiming to get into Hunter [College] High School.  So anyway, I didn't get into Hunter [College] High School because my Algebra was--score was not high enough.  My English score was high enough, but my Algebra score wasn't.  So I didn't get into Hunter, and that's how I got into Morris High School [New York, New York].  What happened was that my mother at the time that I was about just going into really my teen life, left, divorced Fendersen [ph.], Ralph Fendersen [ph.], and moved back to Baltimore [Maryland].  But when she moved back to Baltimore, she was still at a--down on Druid Hill Avenue.  But somehow or other there was just--there was no place for me.  I don't know what the--what the situation--I never knew really kind of what the situation was, but she wanted me to, I guess, continue my education up in New York.
Story_ID: 178201
Speaker 1: And so I lived with an aunt, Aunt Jenny.  And she was on the Proctor side.  And so she was, she had been like secretary of the YMC--YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] or something other, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And then she had moved to New York [New York].  And she had adopted a son.  And so I lived with her.  And she was a highly religious person.  And I fell into that kind of situation of, you know, you're not wearing high heel shoes until you're sixteen years old.  No makeup, and, you know, and that--and--
Speaker 2: What denomination was she?
Speaker 1: She was Catholic.  And but she--she was very strict, you know.  She just believed that you had to make certain sacrifices here in order to have--to make yourself worthy to have a wonderful life somewhere beyond.  And, you know, she, she believed in--because the Catholics, you know, there is penance, there's purgatory.  There were all these different layers of where you can, where you could possibly go.  And so I think very, very strict Catholics really have that same kind of thing that hell-and-brimstone type of thing that they think about with the Baptist churches, but I think there's still that in the Catholic religion also.  So anyway, I am--I--became--then I became--I became very spiritual, very, very religious.  Went to first communion.  And I had a holy communion.  Went to--went through to the confirmation.  And learned all the catechisms and all that kind of stuff when--when I was with her.  And then I stayed with her and my cousin, Vera, lived with her also.  I stayed with her and with Vera until I graduated from high school.  And --
Speaker 2: Now, during this period of time did you have any contact with your father [Cab Calloway] at all?
Speaker 1: Yes.  My father when he would play at various shows I would go down--he had a--he had a--oh, what do you call it?  Guy who dressed him in-valet, they called him a valet.  He had a valet named Rudolph.  And Rudolph was a kind of messenger to bring checks or send the checks for my care to my aunt.  And then Rudolph was the person who would come up to get me and say, "Oh, your father wants you to come down, wants to see you", blah, blah, blah.  And so I was telling the story, I think, to someone the other day.  My father asked me one time I went--when I saw him and I was I guess in junior high school.  Was I in junior high school?  I think it was in high school, just starting high school and asked me, you know, what I wanted.  He wanted to get me something for Christmas or what--what I wanted.  And--but this is to kind of show you where my father--how we differed in this sense.  And so I said, "Well, I wanted a typewriter."  And he said, "A typewriter?" (laughter).  He said, you know, he said, "Don't you want a dress or a coat or-- I mean why do you want a typewriter?"  And he said, "I don't know nothing about typewriters."  And, you know, and I remember him saying, "What's wrong with this kid?"  You know, and something--something or other.  And so I-- he got me the typewriter.  But I just, you know, I liked clothes and I liked to look nice and dress and all that kind of thing, but I really wasn't into that so much at that time.  I was--I--as I look back and I think, you know, I was like nerdy.  You know, I--it's hard for me to believe because when I got into college, you know, I was wild, you know.  But when--when I was in junior high and high school I was just really into the books. And I felt this--oh, this was, you know, critical to--that I--that I had to excel.
Story_ID: 178202
Speaker 1: Did other students know that you were Cab Calloway's daughter, did they?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't.  They didn't--
Speaker 1: So there was no pressure on you?
Speaker 2: So there was no pressure on me as far as that was concerned.  And in those days that was not broadcast.  The entertainers did not talk about their families.  You didn't know whether they had families or they didn't have families.  And they were--they were supposed to be looked at as being, you know, very free and, you know, all the girls were crazy about him and throwing flowers and all that kind of thing.  So that's the image that--that most of the entertainers projected.  Very few of them talked about their families or brought their families forward.  What happened, it was that when I was in high school, I became friendly with some girls whose father played in my father's band.  And Mrs. Jeffries [sic]--Jefferson was the--Hilton Jefferson's wife, and she was a--like a substitute teacher in New York [New York].  She came to my school at [Edward W.] Stitt Junior High School [I.S. 164, New York, New York] and substituted.  And then I don't know how it happened.  She found out who I was and then she said, "Well, I--you know, we live not too far away.  And their father plays in your father's band and, you know, you all should really get to know each other."  Which we did.  And we had a wonderful relationship.  And these were very bright girls.  And Hilton Jefferson was one of the most beautiful saxophone players, you know.  He was just outstanding.  His record of, his recording of 'Willow Weep for Me' it's like a classic, the Hilton Jefferson version of 'Willow Weep For Me.'  And--but I don't think I was friendly with any of the other persons in the band who had children.  I didn't know who, you know, I really didn't know who they were.  There were a couple of occasions I was--some story about my father was playing--if he was playing at the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York] or something like that, at the end they would let kids come up on the stage and do the local dances and stuff.  And so he let me go out on stage one time.  And everybody else knew to go out in front of the curtain.  I was doing my thing behind the curtain, and so I was never even seen anyway.  But I guess I had no ambition for the stage really.  I took dance when I was at NYU [New York University, New York, New York]. But that was for a higher cause.  That was modern dance and you were expressing yourself, for--to get yourself up on to some type of level of--with the earth and the space and the whatever.  So, I was never one--I never wanted to be on the stage.  Although I loved the chorus girls because they were always very, very nice.  Whenever I'd come in and they'd take me into the dressing room and, you know, make me up and put their headdresses and whatnot on.  And let--do--we'd do little things together in the dressing room.  But even that didn't, I had no desire to actually be one of them--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --kind of thing.  And it was hard work.  Nowadays, you know, with the TV [television] and whatnot you come out and you do one or two little things, you know.  At their--when they had shows I mean, they would have shows and then they'd have a movie.  And then they'd have another show.  Then they have a movie.  Then they have another show.  You know you have about three--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So the performers stayed around the theater?
Speaker 2: All day long, yeah.  It was--it was a--three and four shows that you would have to do in one day.  And by the time, you know, they finished, I mean they were like exhausted.  And sometimes I would just stay around, you know, all day and talk and eat and fool around.  But in general if he was at like some place like the Paramount [Theatre, New York, New York] or the--some of the big theaters downtown, it was a little bit more formal.  And he'd have a dressing room.  You'd have to stay pretty much in a confined area.  I couldn't--I could just stand in one area backstage to watch the show.  I couldn't--you know, you couldn't move around as freely as you would if you were at the Apollo or the Earle [Theatre] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] something like that.
Story_ID: 178203
Speaker 1: So you were--sort of a--you said nerdy in a way or are--you were--you were under the influence of this aunt who was heavily into the church and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So did you--now you worked on the newspaper in high school, but did you--did you have any other activities?  Did you go to the prom and all that sort of thing or the cotillion or any of that stuff?
Speaker 2: No.  I was good dancer.  And we would go to little parties.  But I was not into the--into that, like, Jack and Jill [of America, Inc., Washington, D.C.] type of thing, no.  I was never into that.  And I would go to house parties.  Sometimes we would go on rare, rare occasions when I was older, you could go to the Savoy [Ballroom, New York, New York] or to one of the sort of dance halls kind of thing.  But I didn't--we weren't able to do that very much.  And there was still the safety factor.  Drugs were still prevalent at that time.  A lot of people smoked marijuana and whatnot.  So--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: This was in the forties [1940's] right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This was in the forties [1940s].  And--
Speaker 1: I think some people think that's new for some reason.
Speaker 2: No, no.  That's not new.  And people were always, you know, cautioning you and warning you and--don't drink this, and don't do that and I began smoking, I think, when I was sort of at the end of high school, beginning of college.  And I was smoking--I was smoking Parliament cigarettes (laughter).
Story_ID: 178204
Speaker 1: So when you were on the verge of graduating from high school, did you know what you wanted to--you knew you were going to college, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But, what did you--and how did you end up going to--you went to Hunter [College of The City University of New York; New York, New York] at first, right?
Speaker 2: First I went to Hunter, yes.
Speaker 1: A lot of people you say were going to Hunter College?
Speaker 2: Well, you, it--because it was free.  If you could pass the test and if you had, you know--if you could show some promise and had very good grades, it was equivalent to City College [of the City University of New York; New York, New York] for boys in-and it was an all-girls school, Hunter.  And was considered a great honor to go to Hunter.  If you were a Hunter girl, it was a big deal.  But yeah, I was thinking at that time--I was thinking about journalism and about being a writer or something vaguely or at least teaching English.  I remember that our dean of women at Morris High School [New York, New York] said, "You know Camay I'd like for you to come back someday and be part of our English department."  So, that was kind of where I was going.  But what happened was that my father was then married to [Zulme] "Nuffie" MacNeal and --
Speaker 1: Nuffie?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well her first name was Zulme MacNeal, but they called her Nuffie.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Her first name was Zulme?
Speaker 2: Zulme.
Speaker 1: And they called her Nuffie?
Speaker 2: And they called her Nuffie.  Her--her--she was from Louisiana.  And when she was born, I think she was the youngest of this like seven or eight girls and her mother said this is enough.  So they called--so they started calling her Nuffie.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  And Zulme was her actual name?
Speaker 2: Her name--her name was Zulme.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was married to her and they were in California actually living with Lena Horne.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And so he asked me--I think they just wanted to kind of au pair or it--somebody, you know, like a babysitter, somebody to be there with the baby.  And so with my sister, Chris [Calloway], so they asked me if I would, you know, come out.  And I really had a choice of staying where I was and, you know, going on to school.  In fact, my cousin, Vera, who I was living with at that--at the time, you know, advised me not to go.  But I felt as though it was, you know, living with Lena Horne, and being in Hollywood [California] that kind of thing, it was an opportunity I would never probably ever be able to have again.  So I left school and went out to California and stayed in California for a year.
Story_ID: 178205
Speaker 1: How was it?  What kind of experience did you have out there living with Lena Horne and Cab Calloway and you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, they were--they were out seeing the sights.  I was there baby-sitting.  I might as well have been in New York (laughter).  But, no I had--I did have some experiences.  I never went, I don't think I ever went to the--to the studio with Lena.  But I went to a recording session with her.  I went some place where she was doing a recording.  And--
Speaker 1: Was this before 'Stormy Weather' or afterwards do you --
Speaker 2: I think they were in--probably involved with 'Stormy Weather.'  I'm--yeah with--with some time--
Speaker 1: You think they were filming it around that time?
Speaker 2: --around that area.  Yeah sometime around that time.  And she had a--I met, you know, some very interesting people.  And some movie stars, near movie stars that--that kind of thing.  So that part of it was very interesting.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the ones you remember other than those two?
Speaker 2: See, who did we actually meet?  There was another black star, what was her name?  She was the one that was very attractive and died early.
Speaker 1: Dorothy Dandridge?
Speaker 2: Dorothy Dandridge. But she was primarily dancing and whatnot at that time.  And so I met her and she was--I met Mickey Rooney.  I met--trying to see who else.  I didn't meet anybody that I really wanted to meet like Cary Grant and Errol Flynn or some--Those people--yeah I didn't.  None of those people--
Speaker 1: Did you meet any of the other black stars like Eddie ["Rochester"] Anderson or Rochester or --
Speaker 2: Bill ["Bojangles"] Robinson, but --
Speaker 1: What was he like, would you say?
Speaker 2: Bill Robinson?  Very nice, really nice, nice man.  He was--he was going to take me to meet Shirley Temple, but something happened we never--never quite got that far.  But he was a very, very--he taught me some steps and, you know, he was just a really, really kindly type person.  He really was.
Speaker 1: Now what was Lena Horne like?  Well, what did you think of her?
Speaker 2: She was very beautiful.  And I mean she was just beautiful any time of day you saw her.  In any place, anywhere, any time.  She was very, very beautiful.  She was a little bit temperamental at that time.  She was--she was married then to Lennie Hayton.  He was white.  And he was very nice and very solicitous and whatnot, you know, to her.  She seemed kind of--to me at that time--very restless and sort of not satisfied with anything.  And I guess that's the way you have to be to kind of get it, make it to the top.  Because she was complaining that, you know, they weren't giving her this or weren't putting her where the--you know, she had some feelings about her treatment at this studio.  So--and she liked me.  We got along real well.  And at a time that that my father and I became estranged when I was in college, she brought us back together.  So that was good.  And she was a good, kind person.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) Well, what happened? How did you all--
Story_ID: 178206
Speaker 1: --How did you all [Murphy and her father, Cab Calloway] become estranged?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said when I was in college I was a little bit wild (laughter). And so anyway when--when my father [Cab Calloway] went away one weekend, I--I, had this big party when he was living in Long Beach--Long Island [New York].  And I had this -- some of the kids from New York and whatnot came down and we just, you know, partied and just, you know, had a ball.  And so when she--when they got back, there was some evidence that this had happened.  And so they were--she--he--she and my--he and my stepfather--my stepmother [Zulme "Nuffie" MacNeal] were very critical of me and saying I was very deceitful.  That I had made them think that I was, you know, very saintly or doing very good things and whatnot at school.  And that, you know, really I wasn't that kind of a person.  That I was sort of like a bad person and whatnot.  So I got mad and I had nothing, I mean zero.  And I said, Forget it, you know, goodbye, and so I walked out.  And my father I remember sort of started after me, and my stepmother said "Know what? If she's going, let her go.  Let her go." So I left.  And I got a job, but I stayed in school and I got about three jobs.  And my mother helped me.  And so I stayed--I was estranged from my father for, I guess, almost two years.  And then I think he went to see Lena [Horne] one night and so she asked about me and so he said, "I don't know where she is.  She's some place in New York.  You know, she's messed up.  And then Ms. Big, you know, she just walked out.  And I don't know what she's doing.  She's probably on the street or, you know, some whatever."  And so she said to him, "You find her, and you bring her here to the theater tomorrow night."  Which he did.  He called me.
Speaker 1: That was--that was a very insightful of her (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.  And so we made-up and it was a good thing.  It was--it was a very good thing.  And because I was really hurting, in great pain.  And was making a lot of mistakes because of it.  Because I was saying, "Well, you know, I've been kicked out.  I've been thrown out, bye. Do whatever, you know, what difference does it make, nobody cares."  Sort of, you know, that kind of thing, so--
Story_ID: 178207
Speaker 1: After we got back together [Murphy and her father, Cab Calloway], you know, I pulled myself together and--and graduated from NYU [New York University, New York, New York] and did well.  And when I--when I went to NYU I decided that I really wanted to go into education.  And, you know, I thought I was going to be teaching on a higher level and get into some of the--maybe be teaching high school or something of that type.  But when I went to school the veterans had come back from World War II.  You couldn't get into classes, you know.  They--on the GI Bill [The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] and whatnot, those classes they--they had preference and those classes were filled up.  So I went into elementary education because--and really nursery, kindergarten, to third grade that's the way that that block of training was mapped out.  And so a lot of them were not going into that area and so I was able to get in.  But it was very difficult in New York when the veterans returned, for women especially to get into various courses and to get course work and to really be trained and qualified for a--for jobs.  So I went into elementary.
Speaker 2: Now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And I enjoyed it.  I loved it.
Speaker 2: --now who were--did you have any teachers that were particularly helpful to you or took an interest in you as a student?
Speaker 1: At NYU?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Or Hunter [College of The City University of New York; New York, New York], either, you know?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, there was a teacher, Tillie Pine [ph.] who was--she was kind of an early childhood specialist.  And she was very--I would go to her and talk to her about my work and what I was doing.  I am trying to think of--there was a black woman who was a folk singer who was--who was associated with Little Red School House [New York, New York].  Because see, NYU was down in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York], so I did all of my training at Greenwich House [Music School, New York, New York] and Little Red School House.  And it was another--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Folk singer.  Is she famous?  Now, is she fairly well-known now?
Speaker 1: Her name was sort of like--Charity Bailey was her name.  Charity Bailey.  And she was very close to me.  And she did--she did a lot to help me, you know, with my work.  And she was associated--she taught at Little Red School House, but she also did all of these records and stories.  And she was sort of a griot plus folk singer.  And so I kind of got into that milieu because of my association with her.  But she was very, very talented.  And she never sort of branched out much beyond the village.  She would go into some of the places down there and sing in the coffee houses and that kind of thing.  But she--she's sort of more well known around for children's songs and music.
Story_ID: 178208
Speaker 1: Any teachers or anything there at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] that really stood out or just was pretty normal?
Speaker 2: I don't--yeah.  Pretty much, you know, NYU was sort of like a factory type thing, you just go.  What--where I went to--I was living in--in what was like a dormitory.  It was called Judson [House, New York, New York].  And it was connected to a church [Judson Memorial Church, New York, New York].  And it was a mixed dormitory, men and women.  What you--what you would have to do, you would have to do some in-service work at the church, at Judson, their after school program, or their recreation program.  And then they would give you very, very low rate for your room.  So I did that for oh, about three years while I was there.  And when I first went to NYU I went to--I was in--they have a small dormitory there.  I had a room like about the size of a closet.  And, you know, but you had to--my father [Cab Calloway] paid for that and all that kind of thing.  But when I--when we had this kind of breakup, you know, I couldn't stay there anymore so I had--so I stayed over at Judson House.  And there were a lot of students there.  And I think that I made some good friends there.  The minister's wife sang in the chorus at Radio City Music Hall [New York, New York].  And she was--she had an excellent voice and whatnot.  And so she at times would let us come up to Radio City and see her shows, get us in free to see her shows.  There was not one black act at Radio City Music Hall at that time.  Nobody--nobody black in the chorus.  Nobody black at the Rockette dancers [The Rockettes].  No--nowhere.  And that was--but there was a very strong--at NYU at that time was a very strong communistic movement.  And I would go and, you know, listen, but I never got that sort of politically involved at that point.  But I was--I was very kind of unhappy with my family as I went through NYU because I felt as though they were just living this very superficial type of life.  And my mother [Zelma Proctor]--some of the things I would talk to her about, she had no idea, you know.  If I mentioned [Joseph] Stalin or so she was who is that, what is it, you know.  She just didn't have any sense of what kind of--what was going on.  So I guess I got into that sort of sophomoric kind of thing of, you know, I had all this knowledge.  They didn't know anything.  But it was--it was a very, very exciting place because it was in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] with all the artists and with all of the creativity and whatnot going on.  And then at the same time, you know, you had this sort of serious educational, large educational institution that was doing a lot of research and--
Speaker 1: Were there--were there black writers?  I know--I don't know had--had LeRoi Jones [later Amiri Baraka] emerged yet in those days as a writer or-
Speaker 2: --I don't (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --in the village?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think of who might have been around then.  Certainly Adam Clayton Powell [, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Powell.
Speaker 1: Emerged as a --
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: --as a political force?
Speaker 2: Yes he was, yes he was.  And we went to his church [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York] a couple of times.  Met him, talked with him.  He came to NYU.  They had--well they used to have wonderful speakers and wonderful humanities types of programming.  So we were really exposed--
Story_ID: 178209
Speaker 1: Of course, the Harlem [New York, New York] scene was a little bit off of NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  Although I was working at--during this interim period I said I had three jobs--one of my jobs was in Harlem in a grocery store.  I was working there in the checking out--was the first time I saw people eating starch.  Have you ever heard that pregnant women eating starch?
Speaker 2: And detergent too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  That was the first time I saw that [Pica (disorder)] when I was up there.  But the Harlem scene was a little bit different.  I do remember my father [Cab Calloway], I don't remember at what point this was, I think it was when I was still in high school that he had invited me to a party with Paul Robeson and at--up at a 135th Street [New York, New York].  And that was sort of during--I guess during the time of maybe the [Harlem] Renaissance period.  Maybe it was a little earlier, you know.  But anyway I met Paul Robeson--
Speaker 2: This was when you were--much earlier?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was when I was in high school.  And I met Paul Robeson at that time.  And he--and I think--I remember the conversation pretty much that I had with him, because it was about teaching.  And I hadn't really--at that time as I said I thought I wanted to be a journalist and so I told him that I wanted to be-- he said, "Have you ever thought about teaching?" And I, you know, I said, "Yeah.  I guess, you know, maybe I've--that's crossed my mind because you have to have a job, you know, it's a job and it's something I think I would like to do."  And then he said, "In Mississippi?" (laughter).  And I said, "No way" (laughter).  I remember telling him, no.  You know, no I wouldn't think about teaching in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: This is interesting now--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --how things have developed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When you graduated from NYU you worked in preschool for a while?
Speaker 1: Um hum.  Yeah, yeah.  And--
Speaker 2: And that was in (unclear)--matter of well, yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: About ten years, I guess you were doing--
Speaker 1: Yeah I was in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I worked in preschool.  I worked in kindergarten.  I worked at Greenwich House [Music School, New York, New York].  I worked, then I got married and came down to Washington, D.C.  And went to--it was so funny because my husband [Booker Brooks] was still in school.  He was at Miner Teachers College [later, District of Columbia Teachers College, Washington, D.C.].  And I was sort of going to be the breadwinner to a large extent.  And I thought with my background from NYU that I would have no problem getting a job in public schools in Washington, D.C.  And when I applied, they wouldn't accept me because I--there were certain courses, that were courses like--? Did you have a course in anti-so, it was like an anti-alcohol.  It was some kind of course that you had to take that was dealing with a health course.  I hadn't had that course.  And you had to have that.  And they said well what-- and they were so nasty.  And they said well we can maybe take you on as a probationary person.  Now this is in the black schools, but we--but you have to take these courses.  And so, you know, well I have worked with Tillie Pine.  I have done--you know, I was counting all of this stuff.  I've had child psychology.  How many of these people here that you're hiring have had child psychology?  No, and that was so--anyway I, again, got angry walked out and I said I will never, if I starved to death, I will never teach in [Washington] D.C. public schools.  So that was when I got a job at Burgundy Farm Country Day School.  And that was a private school out in--in Alexandria [Virginia].  And I did not--and I got that job through Tillie Pine, 'cause Tillie Pine knew Agnes Sailor [ph.] who was then the director of the school.
Story_ID: 178210
Speaker 1: You mentioned Tillie Pine a number of times.  Now who was she and--
Speaker 2: She was a kind of--like a consultant.  She taught a couple courses at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] when I was there, but she was not like one of the main teachers.  She was connected with the--what they call the progressive school movement in New York City [New York].  And she worked with all of the schools that were kind of--I was going to say to the right of center, but to the left of center.  That were doing a lot of experimental and--it was sort of like the Montessori Movement.  And the--and later it was [Jean] Piaget that had some influence on early childhood education.  But she was a writer, and she wrote a lot of materials on early childhood and--as I say, she was in that progressive education movement.
Speaker 1: So she--they were kind of pushing the limits of it and trying push it forward?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: And so Burgundy Farm [Country Day School, Alexandria, Virginia] when I first went there, they were a progressive school.  You didn't bother to teach--to do anything about reading, until a child was about eight years old.  When he had had all of these experiences and he was so ready in terms of his kinesthetic abilities, his ability to look and think at things in dimension.  You know, there were all these various principles and reasoning behind this delayed reading.  And that was the big push for the progressive [school movement].  That was what was so different than the regular schools in that it was this delayed reading program.  So you did a lot of block building, working with clay, doing various projects.  Setting up stores in, your little grocery stores and things.  Taking kids to the post office, you know, you did all these kinds of-- lead-up materials, but you didn't teach them phonics.  You didn't say this is a word, this is a book, you just read them a lot of books.  Let 'em look at a lot of picture etc., etc.
Speaker 1: Were most of your students, white or black--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: White.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They was white.
Speaker 1: But there were some black students?
Speaker 2: There were some black students.  One of the black students is now very high up in the Episcopal Church.  His name is James Lewis [ph.], Reverend Lewis.  And he--his father was an undertaker in--in Alexandria, Virginia and he used to come.  The mayor of Washington, his--Mayor Washington.
Speaker 1: Walter Washington?
Speaker 2: Walter Washington's daughter [Bennetta Jules-Rosette] came--went--attended Burgundy Farm.  And I taught all of them and took them out there to the school.  Dr. Grave [ph.] from Washington, D.C.  His son, who's now a doctor was at Burgundy Farm.  So a lot of--a lot of people at that level, more or less, the higher socioeconomic in both white and black attended Burgundy Farm.  And so I was there as the--I got hired there because of Tillie Pine, because--I was the first black teacher at the school.  And Agnes Sailor [ph.] didn't really think that I looked black enough.  She--(laughter) she wanted somebody there that would--that they would actually understand.  Her family, Agnes Sailor's family, had come out of Strawbridge & Clothier in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  She was quite a wealthy woman, but she had sort of broken off from her family.
Story_ID: 178413
Speaker 1: This has to sit in the middle.  This has to sit over here.  This has to sit there.  And they began doing things like geography and land masses and understanding difference between water and earth.  You know, very, very early.  And they do it with puzzles and manipulative things.  And I think it really works extremely well for black kids.
Speaker 2: We're talking about the Montessori Method?
Speaker 1: The Montessori Method.
Speaker 2: She said you really, really think it's--you would recommend that from--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: -- black students?
Speaker 1: Yes, I would, I would.  I, because as I say, it was developed for poor children in Italy.  Many of them who were living in orphanages and who were kind of away from their families.  And that's what you find with many black children today.  They are--
Speaker 2: Their parents are not at home.
Speaker 1: Parents are not at home or parents are out there.  Their minds are not with their kids.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Their minds are someplace else.  And, or you find them--that their very, very young parents and they are trying to get what they can get out of life.  And they don't want to put all this energy and attention and whatnot to their kids.  So I think that Montessori would be very, very good.
Speaker 2: So the method allows for the child to develop on a level without, I mean, compensates on some level for the lack of attention they might get from another source.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they have small successes as they go along.  And you, you grad--you start with this, and then go into the golden needs.  And you go into the next, you know, so that they get these successes.  And when it's fully known, you move on to the next level.  So I think it's--that kind of thing is very obvious.  Plus the children have to become very oriented to the environment.  So they have what they even call staggered enrollment.  That you only maybe take five children for so many weeks and then you go on.  You get ten, take five other children.  And so it's a very staggered type of enrollment.  And the children become very oriented to the environment.
Speaker 2: Now, at Burgundy Farm [Country Day School, Arlington, Virginia], did you try out a number of these techniques, [Jean] Piaget stuff and the Montessori?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.  We did the--Piaget was the underlying philosophy.  But we worked with some with Montessori materials.  Montessori at that time required trained Montessori teachers and the--and all of the equipment.  They wouldn't--they did not encourage you to use like just use one part of their methodology.  In fact, you couldn't even order their materials unless you could show that you were a trained Montessori teacher.  You can't get it.  And Burgundy Farm was a farm.  They had horses.  They had chickens.  They had pigs and dogs and things.  So the children had that kind of experience.  There were woods up behind the school.  And the kids had, you know, their science classes, and outdoor classes there.  They were a bird banding station.  And we had--they would catch the birds in the nest and put the bands on them, and, you know, follow the --
Speaker 2: Track their movement of the birds--
Speaker 1: Track them.  They were one of the first private schools that had its own swimming pool.  And they built a large pool and taught aquatic, you know, I mean taught swimming and those kinds of things.  But not much in the way of sports.  Some soccer, but it wasn't--that wasn't their thing, not much.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Dance, they had modern--they taught modern dance.  And a lot of art.  And a lot of drama.
Speaker 2: Sounds like Antioch College [Yellow Springs, Ohio].
Speaker 1: (laughter).
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but now you were there for ten years now, am I right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) And, and--
Story_ID: 178414
Speaker 1: How did that--is there anything else you want to say about Burgundy Farm [Country Day School, Arlington, Virginia] before we go to Nigeria?
Speaker 2: No, I--you know I--I think I learned a lot from--from Burgundy Farm.  It was a cooperative school.  I learned how important parent input and parent support is in the school system.  And I worked with Agnes Sailor [ph.] who was a magnificent educator.  And she had left her families more or less to work in the coal mines with the miners in Pennsylvania.  And she brought this--this kind of new way of thinking and new way of operating to--and I remember I was in--experience with her I was invited to her home for dinner and she served only asparagus.
Speaker 1: Only?
Speaker 2: Only asparagus (laughter).  No potatoes, no meat, just asparagus.
Speaker 1: Was that her-- was it just that day, asparagus day, or did she eat asparagus all the time?
Speaker 2: She ate asparagus.  She ate a lot of asparagus.  But she did not think you needed, you know, all this other kind of thing.  You needed a nice glass of iced tea and a big plate of asparagus.  And I think she had some kind of sauce on the side.  You could put it on or not put it on.  That was it.  And for--to me that was a little odd, but it was good.  I--fortunately I like asparagus.  If I had not been an asparagus eater. I would have been a little hungry (laughter).
Story_ID: 178415
Speaker 1: At Burgundy Farm [Country Day School, Alexandria, Virginia] I met--there were a lot of people there in [U.S.] State Department.  A lot of people who had what they call career jobs in the government.  And one of the families there was closely associated with the African-American Institute.  Which was a Rockefeller Foundation, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.
Speaker 2: Now, is this the African American Institute at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], is that--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: It's not?
Speaker 1: No, no.  This--they have their offices in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I saw on TV [television] something about the coming up of the Independence.  They were doing some things on TV about the African, the Nigerian Independence.  Nigeria was just beginning to get their independence from England.  And they showed some of the schools.  And I just got very filled up looking at those--looking at the kids and I said to my husband [Booker Brooks] then, I said, "Well, I really think we should go to Africa.  I really think we should be a part of this.  And I think we have the opportunity through this family that would help us through the African-American Institute."  So we went.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you're both educators?
Speaker 1: So we both were educators.  And we were--he was headmaster, I was headmistress of this school called Mayflower School in Ikenne in Nigeria.  And I took my oldest son, Christopher [Calloway Brooks].  Peter wasn't born then.  And we took him.  When we went to put him on the plane, he had--it was wintertime he had, you know, this big kind of coat on and we had all these jars of jelly and pots and pans and things or the whatnot all stuffed around him because we were trying to take as much stuff as we possibly could.  And we had--were over the limit in terms of sending, you know, sending things.  So anyway we went.  We stayed for two years and it was a wonderful experience.  It was a great experience.  And I think we, you know, we helped.  Those students spoke in their own native vernacular.  For kindergarten and sort of like what they call "infant school".  It was what our kindergarten and first grade were.  Then they were starting English sort of at the end of first grade into second grade.  And then by the fourth grade, they had to pass an English examination.  So you can see the kind of pressure that they had.  And most of them did.  They were really--they were--not so much they were so bright, but they were just determined.  And most of them wanted to go into government work in the--when they finished with high school or college.  And so they knew that they had to compete and they worked very hard.
Speaker 2: Now the president of Nigeria at that time was Azikiwe.  Was it--
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: First president?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first president was--
Speaker 2: Nnamdi Azikiwe.
Speaker 1: Yeah and he was, he had come from the northern section.  And [Obafemi] Awolowo--we were in the area where Awolowo was--he had sort of challenged, tried to be president or whatnot.  And I think he didn't make it or was killed or something or other.  There was a lot--still some--a lot of political upheaval over there.
Speaker 2: I know Azikiwe was deposed, but he wasn't killed, I don't think.  He was the first president.  And I don't know at that time if he was still in office or not, but he was always respected.  He was a newspaper man.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: (unclear)
Speaker 1: And Tai Solarin who we worked for, wrote for the newspaper [Nigerian Tribune] in Lagos [Nigeria].  He wrote these very fiery articles and whatnot.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 178416
Speaker 1: Were any other African Americans there [Ikenne, Nigeria] that you remember, the, (unclear)--
Speaker 2: At our compound, no.  They were--there were some white Americans.  There were some people from Switzerland.  He was married, Tai [Solarin] was married to a British lady.  And there were some British Peace Corps-type people.  There were some African Americans in Lagos [Nigeria].  And we met some of them.  But there weren't a lot--there may have been a few up at Ibadan [Nigeria].  And I think there were some at--there was a hospital up at--in Ibadan.  And there was some African American doctors who had come over there to work.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But there were not a lot of African Americans.
Speaker 1: But at this time, I mean, the Civil Rights Movement was heating up here.
Speaker 2: Yes it was and we--
Speaker 1: With Birmingham [The Birmingham Campaign, Birmingham, Alabama]--
Speaker 2: --missed all of that.
Speaker 1: --and the sit-in movement and sixty-three [1963], the March on Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Did you--did they cover that in Nigeria?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, there--we read it and then we were getting papers, you know, they'd send The Afro and whatnot over to us.  And so we knew, you know, what was going on.  It sounded you know very exciting and we would, I think, I certainly--I would have been there or part of it or involved in some way.  But we didn't--you didn't really get the full impact of it until we got to Europe when we were coming back home.  And there was just, you know, talk, general talk, and we met some Americans, Americans from the [U.S.] State Department and whatnot, was telling us that well, things are going to be pretty different when you get back home.  So it was--yeah we weren't--we were out of all of that, the March on Washington [D.C.], everything.
Story_ID: 178417
Speaker 1: Did any students of yours emerge as famous leaders or as leaders in Nigeria, or--?
Speaker 2: I am not sure.  A few of them--what happened to many of our students they would--we were like a primary school or junior school, that--that's where--what we were called.  Then they would go on into kind of a high school setting and at the--either at the end of high school or sometimes at the end of junior school, they would go to London [England].  Their parents would--that's what their parents would be saving up for them to get an education in Europe or London.  So we didn't keep--have a--have much contact with many of those students.  My ex-husband [Booker Brooks] kept more contact with many of them.  And a few of them went into medicine.  A few of them went into law, barristers in--but they-- most of them stayed in London.  Because I think about four or five years after we left there was that big revolution, you know, in Nigeria.  And Nigeria was in turmoil for almost ten years.  I mean it--
Speaker 1: Was that the Biafran War [the Nigerian Civil War]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When the Igbos tried to secede from the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was a mess over there.  So we didn't have that much, you know, contact.  Although we kept in touch with Tai Solarin.  At one time he was taken this prisoner and we appealed to Amnesty International.  Letters were written on his behalf and so we did.  And then he came to--he and his wife came to the United States, I think just before he died or he was much older.  Somehow or other he was disappointed in the United States.  He was kind of a revolutionary type of person, and he felt as though people were so reliant on the good things of America.  And I mean he was calling like the good things of America like electricity (laughter).  And he didn't--he said he expected a different kind of spirit from the people in this country that he just didn't see.
Story_ID: 178418
Speaker 1: So when you came back, I mean, were you shocked?  Had things changed that much?
Speaker 2: Well, I became very, very unhappy at Burgundy Farm [Country Day School, Alexandria, Virginia].  And I had been happy before I left.  When I left there--and I thought I was going to come back and sort of finish out my career at Burgundy Farm, but I didn't see much difference at Burgundy Farm.  There was still sort of like, token blacks there.  It was--there was this much more awareness about blackness.  That was definitely different.  And you felt a little bit better about yourself, you know, being a black American than I did--you did before you left.  But I decided that I needed to really be teaching children from--just ordinary children.  And so I left Burgundy Farm and went into Arlington, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you worked on a--now this is 1964, I guess, or--
Speaker 2: Or seventy [1970]?
Speaker 1: Were you getting back--no.  Okay.  So you--yeah it was sixty-three [1963] you came back.  I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And in Arlington?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you taught in Arlington Public Schools?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Until 1978, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And I went in as a kindergarten teacher and integrated a school in the southern part of the county.  And then I--a thing that I did at Burgundy Farm, we had something called Stern [Math] block materials for teaching math.  And I used these materials at this public school, Oakridge [Elementary] School [Arlington, Virginia].  And the principal was so impressed that she told some people from central office and I did a demonstration.  And then I went into a kindergarten center and I became the lead teacher at this kindergarten center.  Then they put me into administrative training and I became sort of part teacher, part principal of this center.  And when I left this center I went into--I was early childhood specialist.  Then they--I was there for about two years and they started cutting back.  And so I had to stay on as sort of part-time specialist.  And then they moved into regions and they did all, you know, kinds of things.  And finally I got principalship at Ashlawn Elementary [School] in Arlington [Virginia].  And I stayed there until I retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And since you've--you serve on the school board in?
Speaker 2: Baltimore [Maryland] city.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Baltimore City School Board [Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners, Baltimore, Maryland].
Story_ID: 178419
Speaker 1: But you've got a volunteer career that is outstanding in the arts.  I mean you've done--now you've served on--you're part of the Eubie Blake [Cultural Center, later Eubie Blake National Jazz Institute and Cultural Center, Baltimore, Maryland]--
Speaker 2: Cultural.
Speaker 1: Cultural Center.  The cultural center to commemorate your father's [Cab Calloway] work.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of that activity.
Speaker 2: Well, that--it all sort of started actually just before [HM] John [Murphy] and I were married.  His wife passed.  I got a divorce.  There was an affair here over in Baltimore [Maryland].  Afram, which is like a big festival then, [The] African American Festival.  So they were--
Speaker 1: And Afram publishes a calendar.  Is that the same group that has a calendar, an African American calendar?
Speaker 2: I'm--I'm not sure. I don't think so
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not, not from Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway they were--the theme for that year was "African American Genius of Baltimore".  And so they gathered these people together.  One was my father.  One was his grandfather.  One was Thurgood Marshall.  Someone represented Thurgood Marshall.  So, anyway my father couldn't come.  They were trying to get the people, the actual people to come.  So my father couldn't come.  My aunt who was here, she didn't want to come 'cause she wasn't crazy about Afram.  She just didn't--she'd say, "Why is this necessary?"  You know, to have a special--
Speaker 1: Is this your Aunt Bernice [Calloway Monroe]?
Speaker 2: Bernice, yes (laughter). And so she didn't want to come, so it was left to me.  So I came over from Washington [D.C.] to this and that's how sort of [HM] John [Murphy] and I met.  And so what happened was that they had all this big dinner, luncheon, and whatnot.  Then he was supposed to come the next day up to the Eubie Blake Center.  The Eubie Blake Center was already established up at 409 North Charles Street [Baltimore, Maryland].  So we all trooped up there and they had pictures and stories of everybody up there except my father.  So I asked them, the director then, Norman Ross, "So what--what gives here?" I said.  "You know, is it because he's a performer that he can't stand beside Thurgood Marshall?" and dot, dot, dot, dot dot, you know. So I went into some little act that wasn't really necessary (laughter), but anyway I did.  And so--and of course I'm the only one coming over from Washington.  At that time coming from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore was a big deal you know.  So anyway he, he said, "Oh, I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry. Yes we have your father's picture."  So he got something together, you know, real fast.  And so then he said, "Now, wouldn't you like to be on the board here, wouldn't you like to"--so that's how I got involved with the Eubie Blake Center.  And then after I got involved with that, then I started thinking about something I could do for my father over here since he went to school here and this that and the other.  And William Donald Schaefer was mayor [of Baltimore, Maryland] at that time.  And there was, a lot of things, so many things going on.  And so we never quite got a site for something, a museum or something that would just honor my father.  And [HM] Dr. Calvin Burnett at Coppin [State College, Baltimore, Maryland] sort of came forward and said that he would like to--he would, if we had memorabilia that we wanted to place, that we--it could be placed at Coppin.  So we had--was at Coppin for, I guess, about five years.  And then we dedicated it.  My father came down.  It was, you know, a big deal.  Then they took--my stepmother [Zulme "Nuffie" MacNeal] was not sort of satisfied with the conditions or something other at Coppin so they took everything down to Delaware.  And but--out of that--out of that, you know, John and I became close and then we married in '80, in 1980.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 178420
Speaker 1: --In '80 [1980] was also--was it '80 or '81 [1981] when--I guess, maybe I got my dates wrong, but I know that your father [Cab Calloway] had this big hit with 'The Blues Brothers.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, it was in the '80s [1980s], I know.  Did it--did it--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And now tell us about that, I think it was '80 [1980], early '80s [1980s], wasn't it around?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And, yeah he--
Speaker 1: 'Cause his fame had sort of flattened out, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes it had.
Speaker 1: The new generations are rock and roll--
Speaker 2: Roll that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --performers.  And then you get funk performers.  Everybody--we have all these different layers.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And then finally--
Speaker 2: Well, you had--you had somebody like [John] Belushi who was a very creative guy.  And he came up to the house and I met him and we talked.  And was a risk taker you know, and wanted to do something really authentic and to that era.  So, I mean--because I think that thing that they did with the cars going through the mall and whatnot.  That was probably the first time that had ever been done.  But he was a--it was Belushi that I think had this sort of vision, far-reaching and wanted to get you know the real Cab Calloway in that film.  So--
Speaker 1: So he had a regular role too.  He had a--it wasn't just a cameo, I mean--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --he had a regular part.
Speaker 2: Part of that--he was part of the--their little
Speaker 1: A character. And-
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And--part of their little group.
Speaker 1: --and they do this transformation (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --at the end--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where he holds a place for the Blues Brothers.
Speaker 2: Blues Brothers (laughter).
Speaker 1: He pops out of a floor and does his thing.  He is--fantastic production over that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: In the movie.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I think it was Belushi's insistence on that.  That--and, you know, he was such a creative guy that he was able to think this thing--this whole thing through.  Well, my father at that time, you know, he was taking whatever he could get.  And he was really happy because you make a lot more money in doing a film like that than you do playing a band around. Interestingly enough my son is--my son, Christopher [Calloway Brooks], he went to New England Conservatory of Music [Boston, Massachusetts] and he's a guitarist.  But he has kept up my father's image in music.  And he's traveling all over with the Cab Calloway Orchestra.  He just got back from Oregon a couple nights ago.  He's getting ready to go to Europe.  And he's going to be doing, you know, traveling around Europe, doing the band.  And he wears his zoot suit in the--does some of the moves, you know, and doesn't sing like my father.  And he really doesn't attempt to, but he's able to give the illusion and whatnot and it's great.  And he's having great fun with it.  Having great fun with it.  So we're interested in keeping that illusion going.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (unclear) just it's a funny movie.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is a funny movie.
Speaker 1: And I was, I was impressed that Cab Calloway had a speaking role in the movie.  I think it may have been a--'cause even when I saw him in the old movies, he really didn't appear as an actor, you know, but he--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He had a--
Speaker 1: --he did have some more roles as an actor
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had had roles in black films, you know.  In like films, they had a--they would have in some of the theaters like the Royale [Theater, New York, New York], in between times they would have maybe a feature film and then they would also show a black film--

Speaker 1: We're supposed to be getting an exhibit advisor coming up soon.  A day in the life of Africa that has something to do with AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'Cause it's really a pandemic--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: --in Africa now with AIDS.  It's horrible.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Right.
Speaker 2: Well, now tell me about the Washington, D.C. school board.  I hear you've been on the school board for three years?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Baltimore City School Board [The Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Baltimore City, Baltimore City School Board.
Speaker 1: Baltimore City School Board.  Well, when I left Arlington, Virginia, we had a--my elementary school was an award winning school because at that time the federal government was looking for schools that had programs in art and geography.  And we--our school just fit the bill as far as that was concerned.  And also we had shown steady gains in our test scores over a three year period.  So we qualified for what they call the [National] Blue Ribbon School[s Program, U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C.].  And we were--we won the--won the national award [National Blue Ribbon School Award].  And so when I came--when I retired and came here, there was a school board position that came--became open because you have to be a resident of Baltimore city [Baltimore, Maryland] in order to serve on the school board.  So Bonnie Copeland who is now the superintendent of the school--of the school system, got married and moved into the county.  And so I finished her term.  I was--my name came up and I went through all the thing with the mayor and the government and the governor, because Baltimore City has a relationship between--it's a partnership between the state, the city, and the governor.  And so we--so I was put on the board.  And I guess my--I think I've received some level of success on the board because when I went on the board, my objective really was to try to increase arts education in the schools.  And, actually, the parents wanted that, wanted more arts education also.  And so I really fought to get arts in the--what we call the master plan.  To have an--then I worked with a committee on a strategic plan for the arts in Baltimore City.  And I think in general, you know, we have seen some progress in that department.  We have VH1 is--has given over a million dollars' worth of instruments to the schools.  And the schools in turn, have supplied teachers to teach instrumental music.  So we feel some measure of success as far as that goes.  But we have had a real, real struggle on the school board.  Because we're very low achieving schools.  Most of our schools are Title One schools [Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to fund low-income].  We have, out of a hundred, I guess we have about a 160 some schools now, half, over half of those schools are what we call in "recon", or they need to be reconstituted.  And our system is under, excuse me, corrective action in relationship to No Child Left Behind [Act, update to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965].  So it--and we have no money.  We have a deficit and we're trying to shift programs around and keep--maintain teachers, keep class size.  It's very, very difficult.  And you don't have parents within the system that are that supportive.  Some kids are practically raising themselves.  We've seen cases where high school kids are raising their younger brothers and sisters.  It's almost like we're going back (laughter) to slavery days.  Really it's, it's some of the things that we see it looks like such a backward move for the race in general.  And the younger--the older kids are very entertainment and socialization oriented and so much of their time is just spent in, I think, thinking about, you know, what they're going to do when they get out of school, who are they gonna talk too, who they're not gonna talk to, etc.  And it's very hard to get them focused in--
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: --on academics.
Story_ID: 178220
Speaker 1: Yeah, things do look bleak, but we have a new superintendent that we're hopeful--well she's an interim superintendent who we are hopeful will turn some things around.  We're breaking up some of the bigger high schools into smaller learning units and that has been effective.  We've established a digital high school that is dealing primarily with new technology and that has been of interest to some families.  Actually in Baltimore [Maryland] I think a lot of the hope really relies on a new immigrant population coming into Baltimore.  We are seeing some Eastern Europeans coming into this area.  We're seeing Africans coming in.  We're seeing Hispanic--not to any large degree--coming in.  And then, of course, we have a Korean population, but they primarily live in the [Baltimore] county [Maryland].  But I really feel as though our-- to stop the--because we're--more and more people leaving the city and moving into other areas.  And I really think that our hope lies in this new immigrant population coming in.  And bringing new languages, a kind of an international flavor, so that we can start thinking of our schools as being diverse, not just African American, ninety percent, ninety-five percent, a 100 percent populated.  Because that's not what the world is really like.  They really need that brushing shoulders with more international populations.
Speaker 2: I guess and politically and financially though, the people that are linked to other resources will bring those resources to the public school system, which are not being brought along now, because it's primarily African American.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that's the--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --population has the least amount of resources.
Speaker 1: That's it.  That's--that's it.  So the strategies really have to be very far-reaching and the marketing has to change.  I mean we were talking about parents who would ordinarily--well, we're kind of hopeful that with the sort of downturn in the economy that some people that were planning to move out of the city would maybe have to stay in the city.  It--it--it's all such a Catch-22.   If you don't have really decent housing and you don't have something in the housing market that's going to attract people, then they're going to move out to the county.  And so when you keep losing your tax base because you don't have something that--some place that people really want to be it is affected.  Then the schools are affected because they don't have the funds to really fund the schools.  One of the things that we're hoping is that--there was a "Thornton" Commission [on Education Finance, Equity, and Excellence] here in Maryland and they were saying that the-- some of the counties that were closer to Washington, D.C. were benefiting more and getting more monies per student than Baltimore City.  Some of the--counties in, Allegany County, etc.  So they're looking to kind of level the playing field with this Thornton money.  And the state is crying boo-hoo because, you know, we didn't get the gambling, that was turned down.  We were going to have slots so the--they voted not to have to the slots.  And so now they say they have no source to get this money into the school system.  So we just have to, you know, keep fighting, knocking on doors, and hoping that people will pay some attention to the fact that this is the up and coming generation.  And if you want a quality of life that is going to be one that you're going to enjoy, you're going to have to have people who are educated, who have a feeling for the arts, who are highly technical, who understand the new technology and whatnot to carry on the work.
Story_ID: 178221
Speaker 1: Tell me, we always ask this question.  And you've already addressed it on some level, but what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that with the coming of computers and technology this has been a great boom for the African Americans in general.  Because I think African Americans have a great affinity for this.  Especially a lot of the young people because it's not touchy-feely.  It's something that you can do independently.  And people--you don't have to be around people--you can just kind of do it on your own.  Unfortunately, the input into this technology, a gain has not been--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the African, African Americans have not had a great opportunity for what goes into the technology.  And I think we really have to begin to train our young people in developing even games on--I know my son was working on something it was like a Native American game.  Things that are going to say something about us and be seen by the entire world.  I think we've gotta get back more to nurturing.  Nurturing each other and supporting each other.  Speaking to people on the street.  Not being afraid of each other.  Keeping a kind of a live arts type of thing going and hearing people's voices and seeing the move and doing drama and things like that, I think, are going to be very important in the--in a technical age.  But I do feel that--I feel hopeful.  When we see some of the young people in the schools that show us some of their skills on the school board, we feel extremely hopeful.  And you just think, oh, if we just had the money to really make this bigger and broader and better.  But maybe it--it'll come.  You just have to hang in there.  We've hung in there for all these many years.  And you know, we've had some bright stars.  And so we have to look to those stars and have them pull us along.
Story_ID: 178222
Speaker 1: At this juncture what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  Well, I feel as though I have attempted to maintain a great artist [father Cab Calloway] that was in our family, that was part of us.  I've tried to maintain his legacy and through that, that's somewhat my legacy.  I feel as though I have not been diverted from my interest in the arts and sustaining them in the community.  And a sort of--I've kept sort of my blinders on in that--in that sense and I feel as though I may be leaving something behind as far as that's concerned.  I think that [HM] John [Murphy] and I have established a good and loving life, you know, beyond the happy, happy years and into the--in--into the golden years.  And I think that's a role model of--for our kids.  And they see that it all doesn't have to be, you know, strictly glamour to be enjoyable and to be a happy experience.  I wrote a book.  And--about an artist here in Baltimore [Maryland].  It's called "Can a Coal Scuttle Fly?"
Speaker 1: Can a?
Speaker 2: Can a Coal Scuttle Fly.
Speaker 1: How do you spell coal scuttle?
Speaker 2: C-O-A-L S-C-U-T-T-L-E.
Speaker 1: Can a coal--can a coal--
Speaker 2: Coal scuttle fly--
Speaker 1: Can a coal scuttle fly--What is a coal scuttle?
Speaker 2: A coal scuttle is a bucket.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) A coal scuttle is a bucket that was used to--that people used years ago to put coal in the furnace.  Has a little lip on it.  And this was a very unusual artist.  His name was Tom Miller.  And he would take things like a coal scuttle and make 'em into birds and this is part of his work over here.  Take chairs and do very interesting things.  So I was interviewing him and--for the paper and realized what a creative person he was.  And so I just wrote this little children's book about his life called "Can a Coal Scuttle Fly."  He had AIDS.  And so underlying this was a thing that even though you have these sort of pressures and other things in your life that maybe look as if they're holding you down, that you can still fly.  Your imagination, your work, your sort of interests can give you the feeling that you're moving upward and onward even when things are really dim.  So that was--if you write a book you leave a legacy. (laughter)  That--that's officially published.  You do leave a--leave a legacy.  I just hope that in education that it looks like some of the things that I believe in are sort of coming around you know.  In education it just goes around and around.  And now when we talk about say the Montessori Method or [Jean] Piaget or how you have to really get kids ready to really do academics in a real way.  And that is reading with understanding.  You can't just read words.  There has to be some--something--understanding.  Have to understand mathematical concepts not just, you know, the numbers.  So some of those things I think are coming back.  People are beginning to see, yeah this is what we need and that all of this stuff that was done as a kind of--in an experimental way I think it's now beginning to take some hold.  And hopefully it'll help--help the education situation.
Story_ID: 178223
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is almost like the one that preceded but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to be remembered as kind of a person who was not just a talker, but an--but active.  I'd like to be remembered as a person who loved children.  And that I was kind to children.  I'd like to be remembered as a fun person.  Somebody who wasn't afraid to laugh or to make a joke or to laugh at myself as well as others.  I'll probably be remembered by some people as being very chinchy and not a big spender.  My father [Cab Calloway] was a big spender, but I'm not a big spender.  I'll probably be remembered by some people as being too cautious and not taking as many risks or moving out forward as much as I should.  And by my children I'll probably be remembered as being kind of bossy, and but--I'll--they'll also remember me, I think, as really sticking to it and making sure that they had some successes and that at some point I felt as though my own success was important.  But I think the future generation their success was--even more important.  So I've tried to do things that would keep them on the track.  None of them are wealthy, but none of them are poor.  I mean they--I told my son I said, "As long as you can play a musical instrument well, not just if you can play a musical instrument, but if you can play a musical instrument, you will not starve to death.  You will get a gig.  You will get, you will have some opportunity to perform with somebody.  It may not be exactly what you want, but you won't starve to death."  And I think this is important for kids in general to find something that you can do and do extremely well.  And that you can sell.  And you're never gonna kind of be out there with nothing.  So--but I don't--I don't know--I don't think I'm going to be remembered as being, you know, extremely loving and that kind of thing.  I don't, I don't think so.  I'm loving, but I'm not real, real loving (laughter).
Story_ID: 178224
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered though?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered yeah as a very loving person.  I've had some estrangement from part of my family for a period of time.  And it's--it hasn't been easy.  But when my child was involved and I just felt--and it was dealing with my father [Cab Calloway] and, you know, all of his legacy and whatnot.  Who had the right to do what and whatever.  You know how that goes with these people who become famous and then after they pass there's all this hassling around about who's supposed to get what.  So anyway this has gone on for a period of time.  And so I'm estranged from my stepmother [Zulme "Nuffie" MacNeal] and some of my sister--stepsisters.  But I think that will come around.  I don't think they--if you asked them what kind of legacy or how was she remembered she is (laughter).  But it'll probably at some point come around.  I'm hopeful.  And here again, you know, where I talk about families have to stick together and whatnot and be a unit that can move forward as a unit.  In my own personal life, you know, that in a sense is--there's some problems there on my part.  So these are things, you know, you talk to the Lord about (laughter).  That kind of thing.  Go to church and hope that you can get the strength to do the right thing.
Speaker 1: All right.  I thank you.
Story_ID: 178225

Speaker 1: Oh, this was a picture that--I was writing a little column for The Afro at one time.  And John--
Speaker 2: Carry on.
Speaker 1: And John took this picture to appear in the column.  We were trying to do something like with Miss Manners.  And we were trying to make it sort of humorous and yet give sort of young kids the idea about certain things that they should do to be mannerly.  And that's John at the bottom, gazing adoringly at me (laughter).
Speaker 2: And the year?  Year for this?
Speaker 1: The year for this was about '85 [1985].
Speaker 2: Okay.  This will be Photo Thirty here.
Speaker 1: This was part of an article that was done for Where magazine, that I was interviewed.  It was an article really about my father [Cab Calloway] and his contribution to Baltimore [Maryland] and whatnot.  And so it's--at his height with his zoot suit on and then another lower picture when he was little older.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: Let's see. (Unclear).
Speaker 2: (Unclear).  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is a picture of my son--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --Peter--of Christopher [Calloway Brooks].  And Christopher has the Cab Calloway Orchestra.  And he is carrying on the Calloway tradition.  What he has done, because he is an excellent musician and arranger, he has pulled up some of the kind of unknown songs that we found out that my father had written.  'Hey Now,' and some other songs that he does.  So he has, he's really bringing to the light of the public the fact that my father was also a composer as well as performer and band leader.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he'll be in--he's coming here to Baltimore [Maryland] February twenty-ninth.  He'll be at the Gilliam Auditorium [Concert Hall, Murphy Fine Arts Center, Baltimore, Maryland] in---(laughter).  Tickets are available.  This was an award that I received through the Links, National Links in--this was in the early nineties [1990s].  And Judge Moton [ph.] and several other very important people received awards at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Number Thirty-six.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my father and my stepmother, [Zulme] "Nuffie" [MacNeal] Calloway.  This was a Christmas gift that they gave to the family.  This was probably in the early '90s [1990s] before he had his stroke and became ill.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What's the date on this?  Now you want the one on the bottom?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You're--are you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's me
Speaker 2: You're at the top, right?
Speaker 1: No, I'm not at the top
Speaker 2: Very bottom.
Speaker 1: Umm.
Speaker 2: She's in the far left.
Speaker 1: This is a picture that was taken in '61 [1961].  And I'm at the far left and my sister [Cecelia] Lael [Calloway], Nuffie, my father, and sister, Cabella [Calloway].  And this was an article from Jet magazine that they did an article about my father and his fifty years in show business.  Can you see me?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is my father's mother.  This particular--Eulalia Calloway [Fortune].  This particular picture was part of an exhibit.  That was on view at one time at Coppin State College [Baltimore, Maryland].  We are hoping to do another Cab Calloway exhibit at the Eubie Blake Center soon.  Eulalia was an organist and a pianist in her own right.  She was very beautiful.  And she was actually a very good friend of John's mother.  They, John's mother [Sarah Clement Murphy] and Eulalia, belonged to a club together.  But she was considered a society woman in Baltimore City.
Speaker 2: Was Eulalia a Fortune or a Calloway?
Speaker 1: Eulalia Calloway Fortune.
Speaker 2: She married a Fortune?
Speaker 1: Um hum.
Speaker 2: All right.  All right.  We can just take the whole cover here.
