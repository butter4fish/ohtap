Mayberg: This is Phyllis Mayberg interviewing Frances Menlove from the class of ’58 on
October 12 as part of the 2008 Alumni Stories Project. So, Frances, did you
want to start by telling me where you were from?

Menlove: When I came to Stanford, I went into Roble, and then I went into Lagunita,
and then I spent I think two years at Story House. I’m now living in Oregon
but what made me interested in wanting to be a part of this interview…

Mayberg: Uh huh.

Menlove: …is that I have a memory which I can’t corroborate with other people. It
could be from another source. But I have a memory of being at Stanford and
meeting Eleanor Roosevelt, and my memory is that I was in a room that was
almost living room like. I thought it may have been Story House. She was
sitting on an overstuffed chair talking with people. There were couches and
they were full. Also, the floor was full of everyone sitting down.

Mayberg: Oh, listening.

Menlove: I was sitting down and just listening and talking back and forth with her. I have
no memory of the subject. It’s just that I was there, and Eleanor Roosevelt was
there. Now, this would’ve had to have been, if my memory is accurate…

Mayberg: Right.

Menlove: …if I’m not making this up or had it from another—I’ve been to other
universities, but I don’t think so. It would’ve had to have been between 1950
and 1954. But I believe it would’ve been ’53 or ’54. I would very much like to
know if she visited there and met students or had dinner maybe at Story
House or did something like that.

Mayberg: Well, that’s something that would be interesting for us to do some research on
now, and then we can get back to you.

Menlove: That’s what I’m hoping. I would like to answer one more question which you
haven’t asked.

Mayberg: Well, I actually wanted to ask you where you were from.

Menlove: [Laughs]

Mayberg: Stanford.

2

Menlove:

No, the other question I would like…

Mayberg: Mmm hmm.

Menlove: …on this is do I have any memory of any particular professors that would just
stand out and have stood out my whole life. And the answer to that is, yes,
two.

Mayberg: Oh, that’s…

Menlove: Two. Quinn McNemar, who was a professor of statistics and in the
Department of Psychology, a big, tall man who made me believe that statistics
were important and that I could do it. And the second one was Albert
Bandura.

Mayberg: Oh, he’s still here.

Menlove:

He is still here. I took classes from him, and then got a PhD in psychology
and came back and was a post-doc with Albert Bandura.

Mayberg: Oh, wow.

3

Menlove: He has been both an inspiration as a teacher and as a very, very, very honest,
straightforward social scientist that I think everybody in this university and in
psychology needs to be proud of.

Mayberg: That’s wonderful. Have you kept in touch with him at all?

Menlove:

Not for a few years, but I did for a while, yes. I would like to. I will do that.

Mayberg: Because he’s still here. I think he’s emeritus.

Menlove:

Right, he is.

Mayberg: But he is in the Psychology Department.

Menlove:

Yes, he is emeritus.

Mayberg: Well, what brought you to Stanford? Where are you from? I just want to back
up a little.

Menlove:

Oh, okay.

Mayberg: Then I’ll ask you more about the psychology.

Menlove:

Well, I was from Salt Lake.

4

Mayberg: Really?

Menlove:

Salt Lake City, Utah, and I came on a full scholarship.

Mayberg: Mmm hmm.

Menlove: I had relatives that came to Stanford, an aunt and an uncle who had come, so I
knew about it, and I think that’s how it came to be.

Mayberg: Oh. Had you ever visited the campus before you came?

Menlove:

Oh, yes.

Mayberg: You had been. Well, what made you continue in psychology? Was it because of
Albert Bandura and his influence, or is it something that you liked before you
came?

Menlove:

I have no idea.

Mayberg: No idea?

Menlove: No idea. I’ve no idea. I just thought it was a fascinating kind of study, and it’s
broad and there were a lot of facets to it and it was interesting.

5

Mayberg: It’s still a very popular major.

Menlove:

Mmm hmm.

Mayberg: Actually, my sister went into psychology. Where did you get the PhD?

Menlove: University of Michigan.

Mayberg: Oh, so you moved.

Menlove:

In Ann Arbor. Oh, yes.

Mayberg: Well, when you first got here, what was your impression of the dorms? It was a
long time ago, so it must have been very different than it is now, much smaller
I would think.

Menlove: Much smaller and very friendly, and I don’t remember being overwhelmed or
nervous.

Mayberg: Mmm hmm.

Menlove: I don’t know whether I was overwhelmed or nervous, but my memory of those
kinds of things is not good.

6

Mayberg: Oh. I had a freshman—two freshman advisees, actually several, who lived in
Lagunita, and they had little, tiny doubles. I gather it wasn’t like that. Did you
have a single in Lagunita? Those are small.

Menlove: Those are small, yes. No, I had a double.

Mayberg: You had a double, too?

Menlove: I had a double. I think I’ve only had doubles.

Mayberg: Well, the students who are there now would love to know that. They probably
think [laughs] they’re the only ones. But that’s a lovely area.

Menlove:

Yes, yes.

Mayberg: The Lagunita courtyard.

Menlove: The place I liked most was Story House, and one of the main reasons was they
had the sleeping porch. There was a sleeping porch…

Mayberg: Oh.

Menlove: … in Story House, so you could go to bed or wake up whenever you wanted.

7

Mayberg: Mmm hmm.

Menlove:

And it was cool, and it was quiet, and they allowed no alarm clocks.

Mayberg: Oh, really?

Menlove: No alarm clocks, so.

Mayberg: How did you wake up?

Menlove: You signed a little sheet of paper as you went to bed saying you wanted to be
awakened at a certain time, and they had a wake-up person that would come
and tap you.

Mayberg: Really?

Menlove: The sleeping area was quiet, so individually you were awakened.

Mayberg: Oh, that’s very interesting. Was there breakfast at different times? Was there
breakfast over at la—you don’t…?

Menlove: No, I don’t remember that.

8

Mayberg: Well, sports is very popular and a very big resource for Stanford. What about
sports when you were here?

Menlove:

I went to the games.

Mayberg: The football?

Menlove: I went to the football games, and I knew the yells and was glad when we got
the axe back and those kinds of things.

Mayberg: [Laughs]

Menlove: But it wasn’t a big part of my…

Mayberg: Yes, well also, women weren’t very much involved in sports.

Menlove:

Mmm hmm.

Mayberg: It wasn’t Title IX.

Menlove: Mmm hmm.

Mayberg: Did people ride bicycles? Did you have a bicycle here?

9

Menlove: I did not have a bicycle. People did ride bicycles. I had taken swimming lessons
several times before I came here and never learned to swim.

Mayberg: Mmm.

Menlove: And one of the things I remember is when you graduated from Stanford, you
had to be able to swim.

Mayberg: You did?

Menlove: And I don’t. That’s what I remember.

Mayberg: Ah.

Menlove: But that could’ve been sort of my parents laying that on.

Mayberg: No, I don’t think so because I’ve heard of that.

Menlove: Yes, I think that’s it. I wanted to learn, so I took an eight o’clock in the
morning swimming class, and I learned to swim. It was a very good class. And
I probably was almost there. But I did learn to swim here at eight o’clock in the
morning.

Mayberg: Well, did you enjoy swimming after you finally learned?

10

Menlove: Oh, sure.

Mayberg: What was graduation like? Were there any events that you remember?

Menlove:

No.

Mayberg: Do you have any memories of any escapades that people got in trouble for or
had fun doing something different?

Menlove:

I was never involved in anything like that.

Mayberg: Uh huh.

Menlove: I just would hear the stories, yes.

Mayberg: The stories. Tell me about class with Professor Bandura. What was his teaching
style? What do you think you liked the most?

Menlove: Oh, he was very collaborative, but I could be confounding it with when I came
back as a post-doc.

Mayberg: Oh.

11

Menlove: You see, I worked with him closely as a post-doc. And so, having those two
memories, I don’t know.

Mayberg: Yes.

Menlove: I could be confounding those…

Mayberg: So, how…

Menlove: …memories but I remember being as a post-doc with him.

Mayberg: Mmm hmm.

Menlove:

I remember being in meetings where we were outlining strategies, research
strategies.

Mayberg: Hmm.

Menlove: He was standing at the board and you know, this answer, it could mean this or
it could mean that or it could mean the other thing. I can remember thinking
that I couldn’t have anticipated and didn’t have any notion of those things until
he said that.

Mayberg: Oh.

12

Menlove: Then I said, of course, of course, of course. I was learning, but what I was good at was
actually doing the experiment with the kids, and I could tell them why the
instructions weren’t working, what was going on, and that kind of stuff. I had a
little niche where I was good.

Mayberg: Mmm hmm.

Menlove: I was a follower. I remember that very well. But I could rewrite the
instructions, and I could watch what was happening to the kids and tell them
why what they thought was happening wasn’t.

Mayberg: Oh.

Menlove:

Boy, was he good.

Mayberg: [Laughs]

Menlove: Boy, he could do anything. Yes, I mean, he was good.

Mayberg: Well, the post-doc, was that for one year or two years?

Menlove: Two years.

Mayberg: Two years. Did you live on campus for the post-doc?

13

Menlove:

No. I lived in Escondido Village.

Mayberg: Oh. What was the difference from being an undergrad to a post-doc coming
back? How did that feel?

Menlove: Oh, I don’t know. It was fun to be a post-doc.

Mayberg: You really enjoyed that?

Menlove: You can do what you want. Yes.

Mayberg: Yes, and that was different.

Menlove: You get publications instead of grades [laughs].

Mayberg: Mmm hmm. But you decided to come back to Stanford rather than stay at
Michigan…

Menlove:

Yes.

Mayberg: …for the post-doc? What do you think about this weekend? Does anything
stand out?
Menlove: Oh, I’m just…

14

Mayberg: Did you arrive on Thursday?

Menlove: Yes, yes.

Mayberg: Oh, so what have you done?

Menlove: I’ve done all the activities, I think.

Mayberg: Oh, what are some of those?

Menlove: Everything. I thought it was stunning when I heard that they had changed the
panel from the environment to the financial crisis.

Mayberg: Oh, they did.

Menlove: They did that at the very last minute.

Mayberg: Oh, very last minute.

Menlove: I was delighted.

Mayberg: Mmm hmm.

15

Menlove: Everyone I’ve talked to thought they have that much flexibility. They can do it
quickly. I’m sure they just had a week lead.

Mayberg: Mmm hmm.

Menlove: I don’t know how much time….

Mayberg: I don’t know.

Menlove:

…after setting that up, and then to have a rolodex where they could get
highfalutin’ people in there talking about it, and it was packed.

Mayberg: I bet.

Menlove: It was packed, and there were rooms they had to pipe it into.

Mayberg: Do you remember who was talking?

Menlove: Yes, I’ve got the list here.

Mayberg: Oh.

Menlove: But that’ll be easy to get.

16

Mayberg: So, that was…

Menlove: That was a very nice thing to do. That’s not easy if you’re running a big
conference, and you’ve printed the programs.

Mayberg: That’s true.

Menlove: You’ve done all that kind of thing and to have both the savvy and the ability to
switch. It was very well received, very well received because we’re in such a
crisis.

Mayberg: Mmm hmm.

Menlove: It leaves people my age breathless, and I’m sure people are breathless of every
age.

Mayberg: Yes. It is because if you were here in ’58, you grew up during the Depression.

Menlove: Well, yes.

Mayberg:

I think the Alumni Association will be really thrilled to hear that you thought
so.

Menlove: A lot of people were talking about how impressive that was. It’s not easy to do.

17

Mayberg: Well, were people talking about the election and politics a lot this weekend?

Menlove: Some—yes. You sit down with strangers, and you do it a little bit gingerly.

Mayberg: Yes, yes, true.

Menlove: There was some incredible amount about the finances and the markets and
that kind of thing.

Mayberg: Well, that sounds really good. Did you have to go off somewhere you said?

Menlove: Yes. Now if it’s okay, I’ll go.

Mayberg: Yes, it’s fine.

Menlove: I can’t see any of these others that look like I could add.

Mayberg: Well, I’m glad you spoke about the weekend. Are you staying on campus?
Where are people staying?

Menlove: No, I’m staying in a hotel down in the university.

Mayberg: Oh, okay. Well, thank you very much.

18

Menlove: Well, thank you.

Mayberg: It’s nice to meet you. We’ll get back to you.

Menlove: Get back to me on Eleanor.

Mayberg: Eleanor and Bandura. I hope you send him a note.

Menlove: Yes, oh yes.
