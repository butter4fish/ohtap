No. I just went up the     Oh, you just went up to 100?  One hundred, I think it is.  So let   s start by having you tell us when and where you were born.  Oh, well I was born outside of Ponca City, 1914 on a farm.  In what day and month?  June the 24th, 1914.  Were you born at home?  Yeah, everybody was born at home when I   that way.  5  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  What did your parents do for a living?  You tell them what they did, I can   t remember. Oh, they had a pretty  good farm and then my dad done a lot of other stuff. Didn   t amount to  too much so it   s not worth mentioning. But back then the major thing  was farming.  What did he farm? Cattle or wheat or     No, it was grain and stuff like that. Wasn   t no cattle   well, there was a  little bit of cattle but it wasn   t too much. It was secondary.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  Oh well I had a brother and sister older than me. I was the youngest one.  You were the baby.  Oh yeah, yeah. I worked on that too. (Laughter)  Well did you have chores on the farm?  Oh yeah, yeah.  What were a few of them?  Oh, we had to take care of the livestock. That was the major thing. We  all had little jobs to do, like everybody else does. Didn   t amount to too  much, but it was our responsibility. We kept it, we done it.  What were a couple of yours?  Huh?  What were a couple of your jobs on the farm?  Just old regular, old regular stuff to do is chores and stuff like that that  the average person will do. Nothing big and nothing small.  Take care of the chickens?  Well yeah, we   that was part of it. My mom she kind of kept care of the  chickens you know. That was her job. I helped quite a bit.  Did she have a very big garden?  6  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Yeah, she had a nice garden. In fact, I had to keep it going myself.  That   s the reason I know it   s so good. (Laughter)  She did canning?  Huh?  Did she can a lot of things?  Yeah, she canned a lot.  Where did you go to elementary school?  Ponca City, outside of Ponca City. A little small place.  A one-room?  Well the first time   the first ones were, yeah. Yeah, when I went to  elementary school that was long time ago. Everything was one-room.  Our schoolhouse and everything else was maybe this one room and they  done several classes in that one room, you know.  And how would you get there?  Walk, most of the time, because I didn   t live too far away.  And what might you take for lunch?  Do what?  What would you take for lunch?  Well, Mom would fix it for me and I   d roll it up in the paper, in a  newspaper. That   s how I took it to school. (Laughs) It was pretty good  eating, too. I   d have it at noon. Old farm people is all we were.  What was the house like?  Oh we had a nice house. My mother   s folks got it in the  Cherokee  Strip   Run . They used to run on   they   d put a bunch of land out there to run  and you, certain time at a certain age you   d   they   d put a run on and  you run, you got the place that you   d run to. If you were lucky you got  it. Of course they was all what they call sooners. They would come there  a day or two before and see what they wanted and everything, you know.  Of course the people had ways of telling how long they   d been there and  everything. That was kind of a standard that them people done. They  7  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  called them sooners. They were there a little early, see? But most of  them was honest. Anytime you get a crowd of people there   s going to be  some crooks. Period.  Did the house have running water?  No, well   no, uh huh. We had a good well though right there and we  had a little hut over it pretty good size. That well was right up there next  to our kitchen door. We had real good water and plenty of it.  Electricity?  Well now we didn   t get electricity till a little later. I think I was probably  ten or twelve when we got electricity. That was a big deal, boy. I mean  big  But we lived about a half a mile from a nice little town that had  everything and I spent all my time there.  You mean Ponca City?  Well that was outside of Ponca City, in the town but not near as big as  Ponca City.  What was the name of it?  Uncas. Uncas.  Uncas?  Yeah, that was a chief of some kind of an Indian outfit. I forget which  one it is. U-N-C-A-S.  Never heard that.  The old farm stuff you know    yeah I went to a single school to start  with. They had about everything and we had altogether and there were  different classes in the same room. Them old teachers would let us know  who was going to be having class and we all went to the front. That was  when I was younger, you know. We all went to the front row and that   s  how we held our classes. Big, big deal.  Did they have pie suppers?  Huh?  Did they have pie suppers?  8  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Yeah, yeah. I bought several of them. My girlfriend   s folks had it you  know, said it was her but I knew it was her folks made it, her mother.  Yeah, we had a lot of pie suppers.  How about dances?  I was a good dancer.  You were?  Yeah, popular dancer, a modern dancer, yeah. That   s how I got all my  girlfriends. Most of them, you know, them old men get out there like a  damn board. They   re stiff as a board, see, but I was a good dancer and  my folks   I come from a good dancing family. Of course I was better  than any of them.  Of course. (Laughter)  They   re not here, see? (Laughter)  Did you have favorite music?  Well, I had some modern stuff I liked to dance real good with. I was a  pretty good dancer. Like I said, that   s how I got all my girlfriends.  I   m not sure what you mean by modern?  Well, when you   re in that deal there   s the old dancers. They dance a  certain way, and the younger men dance to what they call the modern  way. I was the modern way, but I was a good dancer. My family was  good dancers, all of them. I was the best of course. (Laughs)  Well where did you go to high school?  Oh that was a   .hell, I can   t remember just the exact date. It was the  early twenties, I think. It might   ve been later than that. Hell, I don   t  remember.  Did you go to Ponca?  Yeah, yeah.  Ponca?  Well, the first deal was the little old school that didn   t amount to  nothing. When I got older I got a little better deal you know. But it  9  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  was   I was satisfied with it. Wasn   t good, it wasn   t bad, but it was just  about right.  Well how would you get to high school?  Well I just lived a half a mile     Okay so        from most of it. After that it was   high school was   well I was in  grade schools. After I got to high school we had to take our   we had to  go about ten, twelve miles to go to school. Well they had cars you know.  You   d furnish a car for a week, you know, and somebody else for a  week and that   s how they done it.  Take turns?  Take turns, yeah.  Well after high school what did you do?  The least I could. (Laughs)  Now you be honest     Don   t put that. (Laughs)  You be honest with me. (Laughter)  Yeah, I played a lot of ball. I was a good ball player.  What kind?  Oh, baseball. Yeah, of course that   s all we had to do, you see? I was a  pretty good ball player. In fact, that got me to a lot of places. Played left  field. Yeah that got me a lot of places I wouldn   t have got otherwise.  Do you have any memories of the Dust Bowl?  Oh, yeah I sure did. I   ve seen it coming, just roll in real slow up there in  Ponca City where I was living, just outside Ponca City where I was  living at the time. You   d see old dust bowls roll in real slow and they   d  be about thirty or forty feet high and they just rolled in. You could sure  tell when they got there though.  And what would you do?  10  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Wait for it and get ready. Oh we had, everybody of course   everybody  had problems when that happened you know, because we was all in the  same boat. I   ve seen a lot of them come in. Just rolling real slow. That  old dust would be, oh, 100 feet high and just rolling right on in.  Would you have to cover your face?  Well we were supposed to. If it got too bad we did, yeah. But ordinarily  it wasn   t too bad. I covered my old place a lot of times. Towels and  everything else.  And were you still in Ponca when the Depression hit?  Well I lived out   it was outside of Ponca     Mhmm.  Ponca was a pretty good sized town right there. I lived a half a mile from  it.  Okay.  That   s where I spent all my grade school there. But we all lived about  the same.  Much impact from the Depression, though, with your family?  Huh?  Did the Depression impact your family?  Well, no we   my dad was a good farmer. We had a nice farm and so we  done pretty good, we got by. We didn   t    get rich or nothing, but we did  pretty good.  Do you remember your first car?  Dodge, it was a Dodge I think.

Nothing more than just   more than  I wanted to. (Laughs) Yeah.  So you were in the Army? Infantry?  Yeah, yeah. With old Patton, he was the head of the Army.  Did you ever meet him?  No. He was a four or five cuts ahead of me. (Laughs) Now I   ve seen him  at distance you know, but I never did meet him. I   m just an old farm boy  that got there.  Where?  Huh?  Where did you go to?  Ponca City.  No, no. Where did you go to the war? Where did you serve?  In Africa with Patton.  Africa, hmm.  General George Smith Patton     Yep.     was his real name.  Were you drafted or did you volunteer?  I didn   t volunteer for nothing. (Laughs) No way. Everything I done I  was drafted.  Were you married at that time? When you were in the war.  I can   t remember, I don   t think I was. Yeah I don   t believe I was. I think  I got married after that.  And what did you do to make a living?  12  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Oh I worked for Continental Oil Company.

No, never entered my mind. Course, I never thought about it, you know.  Did any of your brothers or sisters?  My sister   s 101 and my brother was 94, I think it was. So we   re kind of  living the long way.  Yes. What about your parents?  Who?  Your parents?  Well they lived in their late 80   s, I think.  So it   s in the genes then.  Yeah, they had the right genes and we scooped them up and away we  went. (Laughter)  How did you celebrate your birthday?  Oh bout the same that anybody else would it   Well it wasn   t much  difference it was   fingers on a wall, about all it was. You didn   t do too  much at that time. You had to kind of keep your eye on making a  living     Right.     because there was very little money around. We didn   t have too much,  I   ll tell you, for sure. But we made a pretty good living.  How would you do baths?  Huh?  How would you do bath time on the farm?  Wash tub most of the time when I was real small. Then when I got into  14  Finchum  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  high school my folks come loose with a bathtub that had little hole     little places for the   you to put the wash tub you know.  Mhmm.  Yeah, I made just about as good a living as the rest of them. We all lived  about alike, nobody had very much. We all managed about the same  way.  Going back to your service in the war     Huh.  Did you see any action in the war?  Well just a small amount at   dagnabbit, Patton was a general, can   t  even remember his name. General George Smith Patton was his full  name. I was in Reserves. We was in next, in action you know. We   s on  standby. I never seen no action, but I come close, but I never seen any.  And you were in Africa, you said?  We was in Africa a while but my main deal was   well hell, I don   t  remember. We   s at the Germans, we was fighting the Germans I know  that.  Mhmm. Mhmm.  Were you in France? France maybe.  Yeah, or England. I was in England but didn   t see no action there.  France and Germany I guess it was. I got me a little bit of arthritis in that  old hand. I don   t understand it. Hell, I   m only 100.  Only 100.  I guess I   m grown. (Laughs)  Well what   s life like for you at 100?  Same old, same old.  What   s a typical day? What time do you usually get up and go to bed  and what do you do during the day?  Be just an old typical farm boy. Hell, I can   t remember what I done.  15  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  What time did you get up today?  Time I got up to farm?  No, today.  Oh about the same time, when the sun comes up.  Sun comes up..  That   s about what I go by.  That   s pretty early.  Never get in a hurry.  And what do you do during the day now?  Now?  Now.  Nothing. (Laughs) I   ve done my share. After I reached 100 I said,     Whoop, stop the music. Somebody else can take over.     Do you read the newspaper?  Yeah, yeah. I do all things everybody else does, but I don   t do them  quite as often. Yeah, we just had the same old, same old as anybody  else.  How important was religion and church in your life?  Well, not very important. I was a Catholic and married a Catholic but we  never attended church or anything.  Were you a member of the parish in Ponca City?  Yeah, yeah. It was   I didn   t really go to church too much, but I had  church. I was Catholic.  So you pull for Notre Dame.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was in kind of an old foxhole over in France and  Germany. That there   I forget what they call that. There was a deal  16  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  there you could listen to the Saturday broadcast, you know. Of course  boy, my old ear stuck up there about four foot and I could get the   what  the hell did they call that? It was a   where they give all the games or  most of them at certain times. So I was a Notre Dame fan.  And OU too?  Oh yeah, yeah.  Not OSU?  No, I didn   t a   not ever take much time with OSU.  Did you ever visit Stillwater?  Huh?  Did you ever visit Stillwater for a little while?  Oh yeah, I   ve been down there, but I only lived about ten, fifteen miles  from there to Stillwater. Yeah, we was just old folks.  Did your mother sew?  Oh yeah, all the time.  Make your clothes or your sister   s?  Well she started out making my clothes. Got up there about twelve or  fifteen, she would buy them. Somebody else do the sewing. But all up to  that time she sewed a lot.  Did she make quilts?  Yeah, she did the whole thing. Usually when they made quilts several of  them women would work together.  Would the county agent come out to the farm?  He would come around quite a bit, but he went other places more than  we did.  Were you in 4-H or FFA  Future Farmers    of America ?  I was in 4-H, yeah.  17  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  In 4-H.  Yeah, for a while. I didn   t go to meetings very much, though.  Did your father farm with horses or with a tractor?  He started out with horses, but then he kind of got the tractor and we had  a pretty nice farm. It was 240 acres.  That   s pretty big.  Pretty good land. I had a brother and sister older than me. I was the  youngest one. They took out, went to better deals. I   m the only one  standing now in my whole family.  What do you think your secret to a long life has been?  Do what now?  What   s your secret to longevity?  Your parents. That   s the secret.  What was that?  Your parents.  Parents?  You look at your parents and see what they   ve done or what they   re  doing. That   s the best thing in the world is check your parents and we  got a pretty good chance of us doing what they do. If they lived a pretty  good long life, you got a good chance. Now my family did the pretty  good life, up in their nineties   some of them over 100. They done pretty  good. Other families didn   t make it so good, died young. But you always  want to look at the family and see how they did, how long they   re living.  Well how did your parents come to be in the Ponca City area?  Well they was raised there.  They were raised?  Yeah, outside of it.  Well, where had their parents came from? Like your grandparents,  18  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  where did they come from before the Run?  Arkansas City is where they started the Run at, but they come from  Kansas.  Okay. Were they German or English or do you know?  Well, yeah they was English.  English.  Them Germans had a pretty good   they always lived kind of by  themselves and they   s always a cut higher than you were as far as   they  knew how to farm a lot better than we did.  What were some of the things you would do for fun as a young boy?  Oh, about the same old thing as you do now. About the same, not much  difference.  Go fishing?  Huh?  Go fishing?  We fished and we done everything. Just a   yeah we done a lot of that.  Bicycle? Did you have a bicycle?  No, I never could afford a bicycle, but oh I had a real good horse.  What was his name?  Diamond Boy. Had a big diamond in his, in his   boy. He could  ride   he had the sweetest run you ever seen just like a, just like a cradle.  But he only had one eye. My dad paid fifteen dollars for him, but boy he  was a good one. But then after seven, eight years he got that other eye  started by   causing him trouble, so we didn   t ride him or nothing, just  let him go in the pasture. He went blind in the other eye, and we just let  him go out there in the pasture. Then he walked over a big high cliff  there and broke his leg. So none of us would shoot him. So we finally  got a   an old boy that we knew, a good friend of ours. Didn   t bother  him at all. It bothered us. He come over and shot him, because he fell  down in a culvert and he couldn   t get up out this culvert. He only had  one eye.  19  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Did you have any pets, dogs or cats?  No, my brother did, but I didn   t. Me and my sister had no pets, but my  brother, he did. He was older than us.  What was the favorite thing that your mother would cook for you?  Well, about same thing that we   s cooking now.  What were family holidays like? What was Christmas like at your home?  Well we had our get together and they was real good.  Do you have any traditions?  Any what?  Traditions or rituals that you used to do?  No, no.  Like some families open presents early or some can   t.  Well we, we had presents just like everybody else. We   d come out  smelling about like a rose. We done alright.  Did you ever have a favorite gift you   d received?  Well there probably was, but I don   t remember it.  That area had the 101 Ranch     Oh, yeah been there. See that closed down when I got to be about  fifteen. Up until that time we was out there. Boy  That was a big deal.  Really big   Tell us about it.  Well there was three brothers in the 101 Ranch. Oldest one was the  brain. He lived a pretty good life, but he died. Then the other two, they  couldn   t run nothing. They run it into the ground, blew it off and that  was the end of 101 Ranch. It used to be a big one. In fact, they had  shows all over the world, that 101.  What kind of shows?  20  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Rider, bucking bronco, everything you know, calves. It   s an all horse  deal.  Western or whatever?  Yeah, Western. I couldn   t think of that. See, when you getting 100 you  forget something.  You   re doing pretty good.  Well, I   m satisfied with it.  And Mr. Marland, did you ever run into him?  Yeah, yeah, you see, he was the biggie there in Ponca City you know.  I   ve seen him and stuff but I never was in that category because he was  two steps higher.  Do you recognize the name Angie Debo?  No. They used to have a   oh it was a big   what the hell was that?  Anyway, they   d feed him so much, the public would feed him so much  sweets that he finally got diabetic and he died. He was a big   I can   t  even think what he was, but every kid that come in there, you know,  tossed him some sweets and he had a lot of them. But he got too many of  them you know, over the years. He had to pay for it.  An elephant or something like that?  No, he was just a horse, I think a horse.  A horse.  I think it was a horse.  At 100 do you have a philosophy or a motto you live by?  None. I take it as it comes. Go with the flow. Some of that works pretty  good and some of it don   t. As long as you kind of keep it equal, on the  level, well it   s not too bad.  Do you have any health problems or any problems that get in your way?  Nah, nothing. Never had a health problem in my life. Never was sick or  nothing. My folks, I don   t think they was ever sick to amount to  21  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Bishop  anything. I never was sick at all. We had a 240-acre farm, a pretty good  one. It was half a mile from a little old town. My granddad got that in  the Run. They used to have a lot of land set by that they   d have a     people would draw for a Run. So you   d get 160 acres. People from all  over the country would be there to sign up for that Run, you know.  That   s how we got that farm.  Do you remember     Well my grandfolks did, but that   s before my time.  Yep. Do you remember your grandparents?  Oh yeah, yeah.  Did they live with you?  No, no. They lived by themselves, and that old farm did pretty good. It  kept us pretty well going.  Do you have any favorite stories of your grandparents?  No, no, no.  When history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  Well I   there   s nothing to say. I just go with the flow   I went with the  flow, and that was the least thing to do, you know. You just ride along  and go where the people goes. I had a good life in my younger days and  not a bad one, fair, older days.  What advice would you give to others that would like to live to be 100?  Well yeah, but you want to look at your ancestors. That   s where it   s at.  There   s nothing that   they don   t make no magic wand that gives  you   to be 100.  No.  You can look at your ancestors. If they lived to be way up in their 80   s,  90   s, you got a good chance. My mother was 101 when she died and my  dad was 94, I think it was. Not all folks    look at your ancestors. You   ll  come along in there someplace.  Do you have anything on your bucket list you still want to do?  22  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Bishop  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  Gorrell  Finchum  No. I just   well, like I said before I just went with the flow. Easiest  thing was me. (Laughter)  Did you ever go to the county fair?  Oh yeah, yeah. Every year. Yeah, that was one of the biggies.  What   d you do there?  I looked.  Looked. Did you ever show any cattle?  No, we didn   t. We didn   t have a ranch that showed that cattle. We come  pretty close to getting it, but we didn   t.
