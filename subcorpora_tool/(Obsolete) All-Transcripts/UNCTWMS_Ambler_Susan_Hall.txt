JESSICA WILKERSON:  This is Jessie Wilkerson, and I am interviewing Susan Ambler at Maryville College in Maryville, Tennessee, and the date is August 2, 2010. So, Susan, I thought we could just start by talking about your childhood and where you grew up.
SUSAN AMBLER:  Okay.
JW:  So, you could just tell me a little bit about where you come from.
SA:  Well, my earliest childhood--. I was born in St. Louis, Missouri where my dad was going to graduate school at Washington University in St. Louis, but I don&#8217;t remember any of it. So that was in 1947 when I was born. And when I was three, we moved to north of Detroit, Michigan because he&#8217;d got a job at a place called Cranbrook. There was a museum there and he became the--. He was a botanist, or he is a--. He&#8217;s still alive. He&#8217;s a botanist, and so he worked at the museum as their botanist and also their assistant director. The immediate area was a rich community, but they didn&#8217;t pay him very well, so that really, in those early years, that really made an impact on me, being kind of on the lower end, economically. And the other factor that was kind of unusual in my upbringing, because my father worked for this organization, it gave me free entry into a private school. And so I went to this private school for three years, well, really, and plus kindergarten, so really four years. So all these children, except for a few others that were in the same position I was, whose fathers worked for some associated organization who also didn&#8217;t get paid very well, we were with these rich kids and just felt like we were kind of poor. And in some ways, there&#8217;s some truth to that, but it was all this relative poverty, not just absolute poverty. But in the sense that the apartment we lived in, once my two younger brothers were born, I mean there wasn&#8217;t enough room for all of us. So my little, my second brother, his crib was at the end of the hallway type of thing.



And so that was one reason why we moved to the next place, which was Indianapolis. And my father got a job at Butler University teaching there, and that was a more normal kind of environment. And I realized as we were leaving and going to Indianapolis, and I was becoming old enough--. I was about nine years old, you know, realizing that it was really probably a good thing to make that change. And another thing that I remember thinking kind of going back to the rich area, I remember feeling sorry for some of the rich kids because their parents weren&#8217;t there much, and they were lonely, so it just, it really affected me. And I think even to this day one reason why I became a sociologist and studied poverty and so forth, and class makes a difference to me in my perspective. And in Indianapolis, I think that experience there was important for a number of reasons. Indianapolis, at that point in time, I&#8217;m not sure about now, but their school system was excellent, and so really set the groundwork for me academically and I was put into kind of an accelerated class, where we learned&#8212;in what today is called middle school, junior year, I was put into this accelerated program&#8212;we learned how to do research and read classic literature and so forth at that level. So I really got stimulated academically in ways that I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve probably in a lot of other communities. And so that was really good for me, and we stayed there through my ninth grade.











My dad was teaching there at Butler, and he also--. The other thing that was really important for me in his being there was he got grants over two summers where what he did was he went out into the Southwest and his goal was to collect junipers. I don&#8217;t know if you know what those [are], like cedar trees, and he was basically the world&#8217;s expert on junipers at that point in time, and he collected them. And one of those summers, he took us with him, and that experience of being on that camping trip while he was doing that&#8212; and [he] took the whole family&#8212;was also really important in my development. I think one reason why I really became interested in culture, and ultimately became a sociologist, is because we went from Indiana out into the Southwest, and saw all of the Native American, not all of them, but many Native American ruins of the past at some of the national parks and some state parks where we camped out. And I remember, I think it was around the Fourth of July near Albuquerque, New Mexico, we were camping out up in the mountains over, you know, higher up in the mountains near Albuquerque. Well, all of sudden, all these people came up into the mountains for the holiday, and a bunch of them were some Hispanic people, and I had never been around Hispanics. And there was this one girl about my age that I became at least temporary friends with for a few days, and that was just really neat to me to encounter that culture, and just that sort of thing, experiencing more diversity, it was really exciting and interesting and a good thing. And we also went to Mesa Verde, which is in Colorado, and it&#8217;s a national park where native peoples&#8217; dwellings were just on the side of the mountain of the Mesa, not on top, but on the side, as well. I mean there were some on top, but--. And that was just so intriguing to me, and I remember buying one of the books at the park and then taking it home, and I made my eighth grade report out of that. And that was the start of my wanting to be--. At first I thought I wanted to be an anthropologist, and then I kind of moved into sociology. So that trip was really formative for me.

So my dad&#8217;s work, even though I didn&#8217;t become a botanist, it really influenced me in another way. And then he took a job at University of Oklahoma, and that&#8217;s where I went to high school. And he moved around a lot, just trying--. It wasn&#8217;t easy being an academic in those times. It didn&#8217;t pay very well, so one year he went to Ann Arbor and then came back to Oklahoma, and so my high school was running all over the place, but I ultimately graduated from high school at Norman, Oklahoma, Norman High School. It was kind of hard not being in the same high school. I didn&#8217;t care for that, so I didn&#8217;t have many friends, kind of like what you were talking about earlier in our conversation about your college, but I went to University of Oklahoma at first thinking I wanted to be in history because when we were in Ann Arbor my junior year, I had this wonderful history teacher, and when I look back on him, I think he was a sociological history teacher because he did what in sociology we&#8217;d call myth breaking. He talked a lot about, you know, that a lot of what we had learned in our earlier schooling about history were myths, and so that was really neat to me, to say, &#8220;Oh, that wasn&#8217;t quite right.&#8221; The early American, the founders of the United States were really very classist people, so that was very interesting, kind of fit into the class issue type of thing.


Anyway, I ended up--. When in college I was taking history, and sophomore year when I took my first sociology course, and I had no clue what sociology was. I thought it was kind of social work-y type stuff. Well, at first I didn&#8217;t like it because it wasn&#8217;t what I thought it should be. It was the science kind of, science-based field. And I thought. &#8220;Well, this should be help-oriented. You should be helping people that have problems.&#8221; But by the end of the course, I kind of got the point. Okay, you&#8217;ve got social problems, but it helps to get the facts about them if you want to fix things. And so that made sense to me. And I&#8217;ve kind of gone from there, since that course, and yet, there&#8217;s a limit to the scientific approach. Because I think one of the things that I&#8217;m still on, kind of on a cause with regard to my field right now, is I think we carry this scientific thing too far where we want all the sociologists to do the research and to publish in the journals and basically talk to each other instead of some of us doing stuff like what you&#8217;re doing and studying problems in the community and making change. And that&#8217;s what I think some sociologists should be doing, and it should be valued. And the field doesn&#8217;t value it, and that&#8217;s my cause. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing these days. I&#8217;m trying to change my field.
JW:  That&#8217;s right. So, what about your mother? What did she do?
SA:  My mother, she went to college, and her major in college was home economics, and her original thought was she was going to teach it, but that never happened. She ended up from time to time working and basically doing office management type work, which she was really good at. She&#8217;s a very organized person, one of the most organized. She can organize things, and so at different points in our family life, she would work. And then at other points when just children needed to be taken care of, when we were young, then she wouldn&#8217;t work, so she was a stay-at-home mom some, but she also was a career woman. So it kind of went back and forth. In a more recent time, her interest has been in genealogy and looking up stuff related to, doing historical research related to her side of the family. And what&#8217;s interesting is there are ties, her side of the family, which are the Garners, through her mother, actually are tied to her. And I really never knew that until about the time that we moved here, about the time that I got this job, I should say, which was about twenty years ago, very coincidental, kind of weird. [Laughter]
JW:  Yeah, it is, because I&#8217;m assuming your parents didn&#8217;t ever move here.
SA:  Right. My parents didn&#8217;t live here until after--. I mean they live here now, but they moved here because we lived here, to be near us.
JW:  So did your parents expect you to go to college? Did they inspire you to go the academic route?
SA:  Well, I think they expected me to go to college. I mean I was always very interested in school. I mean that was just the way I was all along. I was very introverted and very oriented toward academic achievement all along, especially once I got in that program, starting really in the fifth grade, that I mentioned that was sort of the program that was accelerated. I was very focused on grades and all of this, probably to a fault, but a lot of that was kind of within me, but some of it was just the environment that I was living within because my dad was a professor, so it just kind of, you know, it just seemed natural to me. Maybe natural isn&#8217;t the right word, but it just was a good fit. And since my dad had students around a lot and since what he was teaching, the botany, he would take them on field trips and sometimes we would go with him and the students, that would encourage me to think in terms of the culture of college, what it would be like to be a college student, and that kind of thing. So it wasn&#8217;t a foreign thing to me to think about going to school and going to college.
JW:  When did you decide to move to Tennessee?
SA:  Yeah, well that happened because in graduate school--. Okay, maybe I better go back to the fact that--. After undergraduate, I got married, and I met the man that became my husband as an undergraduate in the library at University of Oklahoma. We were both working in the reserve room, and he is four years older than I am. At that time, I was a freshman and he was a senior. He had changed majors, so he was a little bit behind because of that. He&#8217;d gone from engineering to speech, so that&#8217;s a big change. This was in the sixties, so the Vietnam War was going on, and he was a poor kid. And to go to school, he had gotten in the ROTC program to help him pay for his college. Well, okay, so if you&#8217;re in the ROTC program and it&#8217;s in the Vietnam War, you&#8217;re going to have to go to Vietnam, so that&#8217;s exactly what happened. And he spent, he got his undergrad, and then he started working on his master&#8217;s, but didn&#8217;t finish it, and then they called him up to go. When he went, it was the most active year in Vietnam, and actually, it was right when they were starting to, beginning to wind down. So he applied to come back before his twelve months of service, and they let him do it, so he could finish his master&#8217;s, and then go on to--.








Because what we did was we figured out where we wanted to go for him to do his PhD and for me to do both master&#8217;s and PhD together, and we figured [it] out, while he was in Vietnam and I was at University of Oklahoma. And that was difficult because mail took a week, and to try to meet the deadlines, you know, and making this agreement about where we were going to school together. But anyway, we figured out it would be Iowa State, where we&#8217;d both get financial aid. And so then he got back in June, I think it was, and we got married in August and went to school in September. So we went there, and he finished before I did because he was a degree ahead of me and got a job at UT, the University of Tennessee. And so that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here, that job. And I wasn&#8217;t done. I stayed. I still had to finish my course--. I have some courses. They were on a quarter system, and I had really two quarters, I think this is right, that I had to complete. Or was it a whole year? Anyway, I was commuting, long distance commuting, for I guess it was a year. And I was teaching up there on a branch campus and doing some courses myself. Then the following year, I did my dissertation, but I didn&#8217;t have to be up there. So I was down here in--. The sociology department at UT let me teach a course, and I was able to do my data analysis on a UT computer. So that worked out. That was good, so we didn&#8217;t have to be doing that back and forth where basically either--. And we just had one car, so that was a trip. [Laughter]
JW:  [Laughter] So, what were the politics like, given that you were there during the war, your boyfriend and then husband was in the ROTC, what was that like in Oklahoma? And I guess it was still a part of the campus [when you were] at Ohio State.
SA:  Yeah, well, at Oklahoma, there were demonstrations, although the demonstrations that I&#8217;m remembering there were, they were more--. A lot of the demonstrations at Oklahoma were more about fraternity, sorority kind of issues. They were of what I would call frivolous things, although I&#8217;m sure they seemed serious to people at the time, but there were also issues related to race. By race I mean black, white, but also Native American because there were very few Native Americans going to college, so that was an issue. The war was just becoming an issue right about the time when I was graduating. It really, it didn&#8217;t so much get into the politics of that campus. It was more at Ohio State. So it was kind of like after Bob got back, and that first--. So what I remember more is what happened that first year of graduate school at Ohio State because that was the year of the Kent State shooting. We had the same thing going on at Ohio State. It just didn't get the attention because Kent State was just up the road, and it was the same National Guard, the Ohio National Guard, that was just very ill prepared to deal with crowds. But there were the same kinds of crowds of people, and I was part of it. There were just a lot of students that were unhappy with various--. It was a whole bunch of issues, and it wasn&#8217;t just the war. It was again, it was people were unhappy because of the war and there was a demonstration related to the ROTC program. And it was kind of funny because my husband had been in it, you know. So there was a way I kind of had mixed feelings, and yet still I was against the war.
JW:  Was your husband also against the war?
SA:  Not as much as I was, but he wasn&#8217;t exactly for it, either. I mean I don&#8217;t know that I can totally explain--. He was not really anxious to go over there, but he had to because he&#8217;d signed up for ROTC.
JW:  Which got him to college.
SA:  Yeah. You kind of get the picture. And when I talked to him about, &#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you just not go, like refuse, you know, take a stand?&#8221; Well, his answer was, &#8220;Well, if I don&#8217;t go, then that means somebody else is going to have to.&#8221; And he didn&#8217;t want--. He felt like he didn&#8217;t want to make another person take his place. Does that make sense?
JW:  Yeah.
SA:  So I felt like, you know, I can see the moral position on that, and then when he got back, this is another thing that kind of always bothered me about the way we responded after the war, is he felt a lot of anger because people were so rejecting of the men and also women, but more the men, that were in the Vietnam War. And that&#8217;s another side of the issue. We didn&#8217;t treat the men that went to the war very well. It was like they were evil because they were there, and that didn&#8217;t make a whole lot of sense because a lot of those men--. Bob wasn&#8217;t one of them, because he did sign up, but all those men that were drafted, you know, there was a lot of illogic. There&#8217;s a lot of emotion that just didn't--.
JW:  So did that cause tension when you were demonstrating, but he was not completely--?
SA:  Some, and so there was a point where we just didn&#8217;t talk about that a whole lot in our marriage, so that was something that we just sort of had to not discuss it to avoid conflict.
JW:  Were there other campus organizations that you were getting involved with during that time?
SA:  Well, I mean I was mostly doing this with the sociology grad students, so not really. I was aware of other campus groups during that time that were also, had their concerns, and it was like at Ohio State all these different groups had issues that were almost kind of separate issues, like there were some social work students, I think they were grad students, that were concerned about voice in their program. And so they were demonstrating. The Black Students Association were concerned about representation on campus, the numbers, and so that was an issue. There were also, once the Guard came on campus because of the demonstrations, well they caused, in my opinion, they caused all kinds of ruckus. They were throwing tear gas, and so eventually what happened was it closed the campus down. And this was in the spring and classes were cancelled. The spring term was ended prematurely, but what happened was there were some outsiders that came on campus that seemed like their goal was to create chaos. I mean I don&#8217;t know for sure, but that was the conclusion that I drew.





And I remember in the building where the social sciences were, it was a very large building. It had multiple doors around, and I remember trying to go into the building because I was a teaching assistant and I needed to go into where my office was that I was sharing with some other teaching assistants. I was walking up and there were about three or four people standing in front of the door that I was intending on going in, and I realized that there was this female that was standing there, and she was not looking real friendly. And she started yelling at me, and I thought, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to be getting in this door with her standing there.&#8221; And so I decided I&#8217;m going to go around the other side of the building, and so that&#8217;s what I did. And then I decided I was going to try--. I was going to go in the inside hallway to see how many, to see if there were a bunch of people inside. Well, there weren&#8217;t. It was just that little group, and I just thought, &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be kind of neat to go and tap on the window, the door, and go, &#8216;Hi, I got in,&#8217;&#8221; but I was too cowardly.
JW:  Well, why were they trying to keep people out?
SA:  I don&#8217;t know. I think it was just, like I said, they were just trying to disrupt, and there got to be a point where they were--. I don&#8217;t know about those particular individuals, but these people from off campus, they started throwing rocks and breaking windows. So it was just kind of causing disorder, and I think part of that was why eventually the campus, the quarter was declared over. It was a real lesson for me about what it is that creates order in the way we do things. It was a good sociological lesson. You know you don&#8217;t think about it. You just sort of take things for granted, that most people most of the time, you just sort of follow the informal rules. You don&#8217;t go around throwing rocks in windows. So it was just really interesting how that experience was so different from what we normally experience in this society. And you know you see things on the news where in other societies where things start to fall apart and there&#8217;s a lot of disorder and people get hurt and buildings are destroyed, you know what I&#8217;m saying?
JW:  Yeah.
SA:  It was really a good lesson for me, and we couldn&#8217;t even get on campus at a certain point. It wasn&#8217;t free anymore. There was not freedom to move. Anyway, you probably didn&#8217;t want to get into all that.
JW:  No, I did. That was all really great. When did you, since we&#8217;re thinking about the late sixties and period of movements, was there a point when you became aware of--? Well, I guess to go back a little bit, did you become aware of the civil rights movement in the South at a certain point? Do you remember hearing about it or thinking about it?
SA:  Yeah, I did at University of--. I remember hearing about it. I never really got involved in it, but I remember hearing I think when I was at the University of Oklahoma as an undergraduate, one of the ministers at the United Campus Christian Fellowship, which was an on-campus kind of church center that was a cooperation between the Presbyterian church and the Christian--. What is the Christian church? It&#8217;s more common out in the West.
JW:  Yeah, I don&#8217;t know.
SA:  There&#8217;s one church just down the street, but it&#8217;s not very common around here. And I went to that some, and there were two ministers there, and I think one of those ministers had gone to some demonstrations, civil rights demonstrations in some of the southern states closer to here, but that&#8217;s pretty much it. I was a little bit young. I will say this though, and I almost forgot this. This was another important thing in my sociology upbringing. The professor at the University of Oklahoma that probably influenced me the most in sociology was the third black professor to come on that campus. And he came from--. He came when I was a junior from Detroit, from the Detroit riots, and his name is George Henderson, and he really influenced me. I mean he had a lot to say about civil rights, and he was very--. He taught urban sociology, and that&#8217;s what I ended up specializing in in graduate school. And he took us to Oklahoma City, which wasn&#8217;t really that far from the university. It was south of Oklahoma City in Norman, and I remember one field trip where we got to talk to some grassroots people in a neighborhood, and then we got to talk to the urban planners in downtown and kind of compare the two, which was really pretty interesting. And then the fact that I ended up, my first job was as an urban planner, and then later on, I&#8217;d do a lot of--. I mean what I&#8217;ve done more of really is work with grassroots people. I didn&#8217;t really like the urban planning job. [Laughter] It was too technocratic, too political.
JW:  What about the women&#8217;s movement? Did you join any consciousness raising groups or was there a moment where you began to think about gender issues more consciously?
SA:  You know, I think that the women&#8217;s issue were really kind of underlying everything for me, and I got--. When I started joining groups, it was more when I got into sociology, into the sociological groups as a gradate student, there were new--. There were sociology organizations that were being developed when I was a graduate student, and so I joined those. And I paid attention to some of the magazines that were available, the popular magazines on the market, that sort of thing.
JW:  Do you mean like Ms. magazine?
SA:  Yeah, that kind of stuff. I wasn&#8217;t as much of an activist as some, though, with regard to the women&#8217;s movement, but I definitely was mentally supportive of it and still am. There&#8217;s been a point where being a feminist has kind of, became a dirty word, well, I don&#8217;t--. I&#8217;m a feminist, you know, I don&#8217;t have a problem with it.   JW:  How would you define feminist?
SA:  Someone that believes that women should have equal rights and live your life consistent with that, as much as the power that you have to do so. I don&#8217;t think that it means you have to--. I think where people get upset with feminism is thinking that it means you have to do very extreme things, and I haven&#8217;t done that, but I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s what a feminist has to be. I&#8217;m a feminist because I think we deserve and should receive equal pay when we do work, and that people should pay attention to our views, and I think that sometimes we can actually do things better than men. I support women&#8217;s organizations. I&#8217;m in the League of Women Voters, and I&#8217;ve been very involved in the local group. I helped start a local league right here. So there&#8217;s a lot of grassroots work that women can do to improve the conditions of women, and so I think this work that I did with the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange would be a good example of that. Those women, what they did, and so what I did to try to support their work, and I don&#8217;t want to take credit for what they did. That would be wrong, but just to help support them and to kind of be--. Oh, what word should I use? A vehicle between their community and the urban, you know, like Knoxville, because that&#8217;s where I was when we first doing it.
JW:  Do you want to say a little bit about the mission of Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange and even how you got involved?
SA:  How that happened?
JW:  Yeah, yeah, how that sort of began.
SA:  Yeah, well basically how that happened was the person that got me connected with Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange was Jane Weeks. Have you been--?
JW:  One of my colleagues has been interviewing her.
SA:  She is an older sociologist, and she actually lives here, so if you wanted to connect with her, she&#8217;s here in Maryville in one of the retirement communities. She even taught at Carson-Newman part-time, also. She taught a course for several years, and that&#8217;s probably how I first met her. And then she connected me with Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange, but the reason why she did was because when I was getting--. I had gotten a faculty position at Carson-Newman after I taught part-time, and one of their faculty members left, and so they offered me that position. I taught there for five years and was doing reasonably well, although they had me be the coordinator of sociology, and there was one other person, another woman, but they never made me permanent coordinator. So that probably should&#8217;ve given me a clue.




So during my sixth year, the dean called me in and told me he was not going to put me through the evaluation process to be considered for tenure because he would never approve me in the end, and gave me a bunch of, you know, listed some reasons that seemed kind of flimsy to me, things like, just things like--. I don&#8217;t know if I can even remember them now, things like I wouldn&#8217;t teach enough upper-level courses, I mean some things that really weren&#8217;t even true. And so I responded with, &#8220;Well, okay, have me do it then.&#8221; It was the kind of thing that one could address if you knew, but he just wasn&#8217;t interested in doing anything about it. And so he basically told me that at the end of the spring semester I would be gone, and even that was against their policy because the policy in their faculty handbook was once you&#8217;d been there for two years, you would have a whole year&#8217;s notice to find another job, and so I mean I was just kind of--. [Sighs] What do I do?










I was kind of totally dumbfounded what to do and tried to figure out what to do, and then eventually talked to a few people on campus. And there was an appeals committee, and so I eventually went to them, and they held a hearing on my behalf, and they basically ruled that--. And what I asked for through that appeals committee were the reasons for my dismissal. And basically what they said was that I was due reasons for my dismissal, but I never got them. I mean I never got any from the dean. He refused to give me any beyond what he told me in that meeting. Basically what the position of the school and other people that supported him was that he could do what he wanted. He was in charge, and it didn&#8217;t matter what was in the policy. You know it was kind of like, they&#8217;re the authority. And so ultimately what I did was I went to UT--. Okay, before this happened, that fall, a group of faculty who were kind of upset with this dean started an AAUP chapter. I don&#8217;t know if you know--. Do you know what AAUP is?
JW:  No.
SA:  It&#8217;s the American Association of University Professors. It&#8217;s an organization that has recommended policies for universities and colleges related to tenure and promotion and rights of professors.
JW:  So is this organizing at the same time that you&#8217;re finding out--?
SA:  I ended up being the first issue for this new little group, and so what I did was I went to UT&#8217;s committee that relates to people with problems, because the Carson-Newman group didn&#8217;t know anything, since it was brand new. So I went to UT and I talked to them, and they had a professor on their committee that was versed in labor law. So I just basically asked their opinion. &#8220;Do I have any--?&#8221; I told them my situation. I said, &#8220;Do I have any chance of going to court and winning a case? I mean am I being discriminated against?&#8221; And they said, what they said is, &#8220;You clearly have been, have personal discrimination, but the question of whether you can argue that there&#8217;s gender discrimination, you would have to, you and the lawyer, would have to get other women involved. Have there been other women in the past who have left?&#8221; And there had been a woman in English who had left, gone to another school, but I just thought, &#8220;What chance is it going to be that she&#8217;s going to want to come back, go through a bunch of hell?&#8221; You know what I&#8217;m saying?
JW:  Well, it sounds like you were trapped because there weren&#8217;t--. There has to be some precedent set.
SA:  Yeah. Well, and I also went to the law library and started researching cases of women at different universities. And at that point in time, there were hardly--. I didn&#8217;t find anybody that was winning a case, and so I just thought this is not going to work. I mean I also kind of learned something about the law that it becomes very specific. It&#8217;s not a matter--. There&#8217;s a lot about the law that it&#8217;s not a matter of what is right. It&#8217;s a matter of what is, how you specifically interpret what is in that specific piece of legislation. It was a little disappointing in my understanding of what law is about, but you know, it just teaches you something realistic about the way we set up our society. So what I decided is that it probably isn&#8217;t worth my spending time on trying to go to court, and I also realized there were people in the situation, including the lawyer, including other faculty that didn&#8217;t know me very well, including students that never heard of me, but were on campus, they were making up stuff about me that just weren&#8217;t true, and I thought, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t going to be worth it. I just need to leave and go do something else.&#8221;
JW:  Do you mind saying what sort of things they were making up?
SA:  You know, I&#8217;m not sure I can even remember. They were getting into things like, that I was teaching certain kinds of things. There was some big issue about human--. What was the terminology that they would get upset about? I don&#8217;t know if you can help me with this, but human--. I&#8217;m not sure I can remember at this point. I might have to think about it a while. Maybe some other time we could come back to that.
JW:  But it is interesting how the gossip occurs around a woman who, you, who is fighting for a job.
SA:  Yeah.
JW:  That it&#8217;s a gender politics that get--.
SA:  Right. I do remember though that there were students that were making up things, and there were faculty in other, like in music, there was a faculty member that just basically came up to me and asked me, &#8220;What did you do?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. What did I do? I don&#8217;t know what I did,&#8221; that sort of thing.
JW:  And your sense all along was that what you did was be a woman and trying to get a job.
SA:  Yeah. You know, I taught my classes. I mean I don&#8217;t know what I did. The implication was I had done something wrong that warranted being removed from my job. And then later what worried me was my job ended and that other people would interpret it the same way. I was fired, and it would affect me the whole rest of my life in a negative way. And so I worried about that a lot.
JW:  Were there other women faculty at Carson-Newman who were there at the time who had a sense of what was going on?
SA:  Well, there may be, but they didn&#8217;t talk to me. I was pretty much ostracized, and there were some people later, years later, that, actually a couple of men who apologized for letting me, for not helping. But there were some people who helped. I need to not let it be that way. The people that were on that appeals committee helped, but those people were already tenured, but I can&#8217;t say there were any women that stood up, no. And my colleague didn&#8217;t, but it&#8217;s kind of the nature of the institution there, too, that women are not--. Their role is not to do that.
JW:  Right. And you think that that--. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve actually said on record that it is a Southern Baptist affiliated college.
SA:  Right.
JW:  I think that affects the way women act in that institution.
SA:  Right.
JW:  And what their place is.
SA:  I mean it could be not that I was so much out there as a strong feminist, but it could be that that dean was kind of seeing a little bit of that in me, and he didn&#8217;t like that. I don&#8217;t know. You know, I think I&#8217;m a quiet feminist. I don&#8217;t know. Somebody else would have to tell me how I come across.
JW:  And then when you were there, is that when you started getting involved with Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange, as that ended?
SA:  It was after that. When I left there, I actually tried another job that just totally flubbed. It was in the local area. It was kind of a semi-government job that I did for about a month, but they were cutting their budget and turned the air conditioning off and had to turn the fan on, and immediately gave me asthma. And I just said, &#8220;I cannot do this. I&#8217;m going to die.&#8221; [Laughter] So I quit, and that was when Jane Weeks connected me with Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange, and they came, I remember. And so I did that for almost two years. I worked on basically adapting a typical college curriculum to the needs of rural women. And what Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange had been doing was they had been working with Roane State Community College, which has that, has Campbell County as part of their service area. And they had talked Roane State into teaching a few courses up in Jellico because it was really hard for women on that side of the mountain to be able to go to where they normally taught the courses over in LaFollette, [TN]. Because I mean [the mountain is] a huge natural barrier, and especially in the winter when there are a lot of winter issues to overcome.








And so women had taken some courses there in Jellico and gotten some credits, and they&#8217;d already--. See a lot of people don&#8217;t finish high school there. And they&#8217;d already gotten their GEDs. It&#8217;s like their appetite was just made even greater and greater by getting this education. And they were doing this because they saw education as a way to develop their communities and to do their community work. And so then they were taking these courses through Roane State, and some of them did their two years&#8217; worth, and then they wanted more. And so at that point, they got this grant to see if they could get a whole college degree. And guess who they wanted to do it? Carson-Newman.
JW:  Oh, I think I&#8217;ve seen that in the papers.
SA:  Yeah. I mean they looked at some other colleges, like Cumberland College and some others, but Carson-Newman, and that same dean that screwed me over--. Sorry.
JW:  No, it&#8217;s okay. [Laughter]
SA:  He was actually interested, and I interviewed for the job, and they wanted me to do it. And it actually was a perfect fit because I&#8217;d been teaching at the college, and so I knew the curriculum and what I needed to do to be able to do the job was to understand the women. And so I spent time getting to know the women, you know, just being at the Exchange. And we did some focus groups to get at what do they do in their lives, what do they see as their needs, and that sort of thing. And I taught a class, and then we had meetings with the dean. And this was so cool to be with the women, and this screwy dean, although he was better in this situation, he was interested in this. And it was just sort of funny.
JW:  Yeah. I mean how can one explain his--?
SA:  I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t. I guess the way I explain it is kind of in, going back to the church thing, that he probably saw this as part of mission work, this is one way that the church can work with people who have needs. And it is, but what is different and what was different at that time was those women, they were calling the shots. That was what was totally unique that you don&#8217;t find very often. They knew what they wanted, and they were telling him that. And I think it was different for him, but he was going along with it. And also, I think it helped that one of the women in the room was Anne Hablas, who is a Catholic sister, and she was older, articulate, had a college degree, and pretty much knew what he was going to be interested in. So I think if she hadn&#8217;t been there, I&#8217;m not sure this would&#8217;ve worked, and she was basically the director of the RCEC. She was in that position.
JW:  How did being involved in Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange change or did it change your ideas of feminism or what the women&#8217;s movement could do for people?
SA:  Well, first of all, it made me--. Yeah, it made me see that the women&#8217;s movement is not just middle class, and how lower class women can really be strong. That just so impressed me and still does to this day, but it also--. I guess just over the years, that isn&#8217;t there now. So I also understand--. I think that there are individual women that are very strong women, but having kind of that group dynamic isn&#8217;t always there. And that was kind of a rare situation or an uncommon situation, and I would just love to see that bubble up over and over and have that strength that those women coming together and making those demands and other people in more established institutions paying attention to that. I would just love to see that happen more and more. And we don&#8217;t see it. I mean it&#8217;s not there, and I kind of mourn that. I wish it were still there.
JW:  Can you say a little bit about your idea of--? I mean I know that you&#8217;re working with Just Connections now, and Helen Lewis I think was involved with Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange and then helped with Just Connections. And there&#8217;s this category, Appalachia, comes up. Can you say a little bit about your own ideas about Appalachian studies or where you see your work fitting into that, if it has been a part of your career?
SA:  Well, I&#8217;m not sure I totally understand your question, but I guess I could say this, that I probably wouldn&#8217;t be here if I hadn&#8217;t done the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange work because when I came here, the job description was to teach an Appalachian culture class, and it wasn&#8217;t in my repertoire. I mean I hadn&#8217;t done that before, so in order to argue that I could do that, I said I&#8217;d had that experience with Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange, and then what I said I would do was that I would develop a course the summer after I started, and I got a fellowship to do that through, at that time it was a pretty new organization, of the presidents of--.
