Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you about your family history.  How far back can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: On my--I can't very far on my dad's [Salam Hassan] side.  My dad was deported when I was not quite six years old.  He never took our--well, he came here on a, on an Italian ship.  He was a merchant seaman, guess that's what they called them in those days.  And my mom is--was from, born and raised in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Her father was from Kingston, Jamaica.  And they--I go all the way back on her side.  I had a great-grandfather who was born in slavery, and he was from a little town in Virginia called Danville.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: But my dad, I don't know anything too much about his folks, having never been there.  All I know is what that I have been ta--told as a, when I was a little youngster and what my mom had told me.
Speaker 1: Now what did--where, where did she say that he was from?
Speaker 2: He was from a place called Eritrea.  I think I'm pronouncing it correctly.  But it was a part of a, an Italian Somaliland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At that time, when I came along, it was under the rule of [Benito] Mussolini.  He spoke Italian and about six other languages very fluently, having traveled as a youngster, you know, all the way around in that part of the country.  And then he finally came to America in 1920--
Speaker 1: So he was--
Speaker 2: --when he met my mom.
Speaker 1: He, he was a seaman?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: I guess they call 'em merchant seamen.  I know when my brother, my brother, Osman [ph.], who went into the, that phase of service when he was a youngster and that's what they called him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 179710

Speaker 2: I had three.  My--I have, well, my oldest brother passed, and it was me, and then it was my brother Osman [ph.], who is now living in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He was the one I said was a merchant seaman, and he's been all over there, by the way, all over in the Far East.  When he was a youngster, he was in the military, then he came out of the [U.S.] Army and joined the Merchant Marines, trying to look and trying to obtain information about our dad [Salam Hassan].  And then I have a sister, the one sister, Zara, who lives, resides in Williamstown, New Jersey.  But my mother [Elizabeth Walker] had eventually married after my dad was gone about twelve years.  And she married and had other children.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you have other half (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I have, have half brothers and sisters--
Speaker 1: All right.

Speaker 1: --and two full siblings, right?  And you--
Speaker 2: Yes, with myself.
Speaker 1: And they say your, say your father's [Salam Hassan] from Eritrea.
Speaker 2: Eritrea.
Speaker 1: --which was then part, part, part of Italian Somaliland.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And you know, the Italians invaded Ethiopia and Eritrea--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.  In fact, I'm named after my grandmother, who was from out of, out of--was from, was from Ethiopia.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And my name Ayesha, which is really was my first name, but I was so ashamed of it when I was a kid, I changed it and put the fir--and put the middle name first and, and (laughter)--'cause nobody there never heard of nobody's name being Ayesha.  People would say oh, you're named, you're named after the country.  You know, in those days, you know there was a continent.  And I said yeah, well.  So then I got so I started writing it, and then it just caught fire and caught on.
Speaker 1: So your name was Ayesha Hassan, and--
Speaker 2: Hassan, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Wasn't too happy about being, you know, there, 'cause in those days they said those people were beggars, you know, the propaganda was so, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--
Speaker 2: --about Arabs and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Now, so your, your father was a Muslim--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: --apparently.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: --and--okay.
Speaker 2: Now, so, so who, who named you Bernyce?  How, how did you--

Speaker 2: --get Bernyce?
Speaker 1: --my mother, and she named me after a girlfriend.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and--but daddy wanted all of us to have those Arabic names, but I wasn't happy with mine (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, it's funny, people now are naming themselves--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Isn't it funny.  I've found, found more little kids with that name.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's very common now.  And I say to myself, well, you know, I didn't wanna tell anybody that was my name when I was coming alone.
Speaker 2: Right.  Stevie Wonder even named his first child Aisha--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a song--
Speaker 1: I have found more--
Speaker 2: --"Isn't She lovely?"
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, sure was.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Now, so, so your, your brother's name is Osman [ph.].
Speaker 1: Osman.
Speaker 2: Osman.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And so it was just the two of you.
Speaker 1: And Zara, Z-A-R-A.

Speaker 2: --so three of you--

Speaker 1: --right, my--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --by the Hassan.
Story_ID: 179712
Speaker 1: And--okay, so he wasn't around that long, right?  He--
Speaker 2: Daddy [Salam Hassan] was deported.  My last picture that I have of my father was when my mother [Elizabeth Walker] took us over to Ellis Island [Upper New York Bay], where they had rounded them up, and they were there.  And I, I--the mental picture that I have he was in this big room where they brought these people in.  And they seemed to be all people of different hues, of different--mostly all darker colored people from some other, other countries.  And I remember--the reason why I remember it so distinctly, I got a bad spanking because I didn't wanna leave my dad, being his oldest and his first daughter, and, and he and I were very, very close.  He would take me to the mosque with him when he was here in this country, and we were just inseparable.  So, I couldn't understand why we couldn't stay with him, or he couldn't go with us.  I remember my mom taking me in the restroom giving me a spanking (laughter).  She was noted for that (laughter), right on the spot.  But, but so he never took out his, he never took out his naturalization papers, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, it was tough in those--U.S. Immigration was--
Speaker 2: It wasn't--you know--
Speaker 1: --always tough on--
Speaker 2: --the immigration laws were--
Speaker 1: --darker people.  They--
Speaker 2: Yes, for--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it was very tough in those days.  And daddy couldn't understand.  He would talk about it.  The thing that bothered him so much--and I remember this distinctly 'cause I was always very alert about the racism in, in America.  And he wanted to take my mother home with, back with him, but she didn't, you know, she didn't wanna go that far, having been very close to her family, you know.  And I couldn't understand.  I used to tease her all the time, said why didn't go with him?  You, you said you loved him, you know.  And my mother said, say like they say now, what, what's love got to do (laughter).  But I, I couldn't--I was in a fog for quite a while after he left, you know, not being able to, to understand why, why he had to go.
Speaker 1: Okay, you said your brother tried to find him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Osman, when he became sixteen he joined the military.  And then he didn't stay in the Army too much.  He got out of the Army, and then he went into the Merchant Marines.  And he traveled all over the Middle East and different parts of, of, you know, of, of that part of the world.  And he--people could always--he looks a lot like those Arabs, you know.  And but they--and with his name being like it is, but they couldn't understand why is it that he didn't speak Arabic.  But they--I understand they treated him royally.  They knew Osman, from the name, and you know, the Hassan, which is very common, like Smith and Jones here in this country.  And he, he never could find anything, you know.
Speaker 1: Did your father ever write?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.  He wrote for a while after he left, and he would write to my mom, and he would write mostly in Italian because he couldn't speak that English that well.  And, and we used to have--out where I lived, outside of the city of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and--well, they call it suburbs now, but we called it the country and the sticks when I was a little girl.  And he'd write, and we had an Italian shoemaker that mother would take the letters there, and he would translate it, you know, for her and whatnot.  Then all of a sudden, I understand that the letters just stopped coming, and that was in the '30s [1930s], in the mid-'30s [1930s].  And that was--as I remember, I've done a little research on our--I just found out in the last twenty years that when [Benito] Mussolini had taken a lot of those, the people--they were citizens I guess of the country--and they had gone to Russia, and not knowing that part of, the history about that part of the country.  And they said--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --they sent a lot of them over, those youngsters.  And my daddy being such an--they tell me he was such an activist, you know, that he probably might have been, you know, one of the ones.
Speaker 1: He might have been in trouble (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My mother always felt that something had happened to him when she didn't hear from him anymore.
Story_ID: 179713
Speaker 1: There was a, there was a great Ethiopian movement in this country--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: --too in the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: I remember reading--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --about that 'cause I was just in junior high school and when the '30s [1930s] I was going into, so--
Speaker 1: When black people raised money in churches and in organizations all over--
Speaker 2: Right, they were.
Speaker 1: --the United States.
Speaker 2: And see, my mom [Elizabeth Walker] was very active--
Speaker 1: And some when over and fought actually on the side-
Speaker 2: They did.
Speaker 1: --of the Ethiopians.
Speaker 2: My mom was--
Speaker 1: J. A. Rogers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --very--she being--her father being from West Indies, she was very active in, in that Marcus Garvey movement in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I always felt as though that might have something to do with them, you know, with her being married to him, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She was out there visible and now, 'cause she, politically, she was very actist--very active.  In fact, she was going to business school when she met my dad [Salam Hassan], and she--they ran away and got married.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're right, the Universal Negro Improvement Association was, was a multinational, you know, it was an international organization--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --with members all over the world.  And somebody from Somaliland, or Nigeria, or anywhere would know--
Speaker 2: Would know--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--when they came into the port of New York--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and they would know.
Speaker 2: They would know about it.
Speaker 1: They would know to find it, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So and--
Speaker 2: And so we--she, she always felt as though--I know I used to find myself, when I was a youngster still in grade school, so to (unclear)--I would find myself when I would see some of them--you know, they have a look about them, you know, and I would find myself looking at--oh, my God, I'll go crazy if I keep this up (laughter).  Maybe, I said maybe he'll come back, or maybe I'll see him.  And it was, it's awfully, it's strange though that it, it's, it's sort of a a bond or something when you meet 'em 'cause, even in Washington, and I've met a lot of the people there, and they'll tell me: Are you Ethiopian or something?  And I said am I what?  You know, I'm American (laughter).  And they say no.  Then I well, yes, I am.  I said my grandmother is.  And they said well, you look my aunt or somebody or whatnot, you know.  I said well, we're all related, what the heck (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's true, you, you do look like, you know, a lot of Ethiopians I've seen in town here.
Speaker 2: Do you?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah?  My husband [HM Arthur Fletcher] told me tonight when I came out, he said, boy, you really look like one of them Arabs, 'cause I had all my hair cut off just recently, getting ready for the summer.  I call it gas and go.  I get in the shower and (laughter).
Story_ID: 179714
Speaker 1: Now, your mother's [Elizabeth Walker] side of the family, they're from Virginia?
Speaker 2: They're from North Carolina.
Speaker 1: North Carolina, okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at preschool age.  And she was from--born in--her mother was born in North Carolina, and her father was born in Virginia.  In fact, my great-grandmother was, was the woman, she was a midwife also, and she attended, attended at my birth, I understand.  She passed when I was about two and a half.  And a doctor who assisted her, 'cause I know she, she didn't assist him.  She knew more about it.  My mother said then ha--(unclear)--children than he did.  He was married to Paul Robeson's sister.
Speaker 1: And who, who is that now?
Speaker 2: The doctor who was--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --there.  So I've got like--they tease me about Mr. Fletcher and the (unclear.  I said well, I've always been around African Americans or whatever you wanna call (unclear)--I've always been around those type of people that were, you know, that were visible and--
Speaker 1: Were activist (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Very act--or activists, you know, and I guess that just been a part of my life.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, Philadelphia really had an active black community--
Speaker 2: Yes, they did, had very active--
Speaker 1: --in those days, right.
Speaker 2: See, and my grandfather came, came--my great-grandfather came to--only father really that I really knew, 'cause he, he--I didn't--I had him until I was eighteen years of age.  I was very fortunate.  And he was very active in the community there.  And mother always was active, you know.  And so, I, I've always been thrown in with, with those type of people, you know.
Speaker 1: Now is there, is there any history about the Underground Railroad in your family at all?
Speaker 2: I don't think there's any in my family that I, that I remember.  Mother, mother used to comment about--and she said her grandfather, who used tell her about incidents and what have you when he was a youngster in slavery time, 'cause he was born in slavery time, you know.  And she would tell me about some of the things down there in Virginia and where he was from in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: In Danville, Virginia, you were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, Danville.
Speaker 1: Now, now do you remember any stories there were, that, there, that your mother--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't, not, not too much, so I can't say that I really remember.  Mom's been passed now about twenty-eight years.  She passed in the early '70s [1970s].  But she was in the process of doing a lot of writing, which we never published about some of the stories and things that had happened when she was a youngster, she would relate about.  He said that they would hear slaves being beaten, you know, there and things like that.  She said he never wanted to talk too much about it.  And the oddest thing was, not as long as I can--I don't ever remember them going back there, you know.  And now, now as I've asked around, that's happened with a lot of them.  They said once they got up here, got away from down there, they didn't wanna.  I guess it was too many unpleasant memories.
Speaker 1: Yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They didn't wanna, didn't wanna go back.
Story_ID: 179715
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Elizabeth Walker, and her father was from Kingston, Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and when was she born?
Speaker 2: Mother was born--she just had a--if she'd of been living last Sunday, she'd have been a hundred years old.

Speaker 1: Okay, 1903.  Okay, now, can you tell us about your mother?  What was she like, and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, during the time when, when I was a youngster, when dad was, you know, was in this country, she did nothing but just stay home and, and, and raise her family.  But, like I said, she was very active in the community, and in politics, and in community affairs.  And she liked working with young, young people.  And mother was quite a writer.  She used to write at times for--they used to have an African-American newspaper.  I would guess you've heard of that one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, African--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, African American, yeah.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And she would correspond lots of times with some of the students over in some of--in Liberia and some of the African countries.  And that's how we got to meet quite a, quite a few of them.  They would come to the little old town that I was raised up in Eastwick, Pennsylvania, right outside of Philadelphia proper.  And then they would come to our home, and mother would, you know, correspond and fellowship with them and what have you.
Story_ID: 179716
Speaker 1: Now what's the name of that town that you were raised in?
Speaker 2: It's, I was Eastwick, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Eastwick?
Speaker 2: E-A-S-T-W-I-C-K, Eastwick, Pennsylvania.  It's now, now it is no more than probably they've had a whole--they had an urban renewal.  Now it's out there where the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] airport is, Philadelphia International Airport.  In fact, my, my great-grandfather, they built a home there, and I was born in there, was born in, in, in their home there in Eastwick.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you were--were you--okay, so, you weren't actually born in Philadelphia, but in Eastwick.
Speaker 2: In Eastwick, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they got Philadelphia on the birth certificate.  They still included that.  It's just a little suburban part of East--it was between Philadelphia and Chester.  You've heard of Chester, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I know, that's where they had a big ship, shipyard.  Everybody knew about that Sun Shipyard down in that area.  In fact, my father [Salam Hassan] worked there, I understand, when he first came to this country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was your mother [Elizabeth Walker] raised in Jamaica or was she raised here?
Speaker 2: No, she was born and raised in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was born in Philadelphia (unclear) right downtown in South Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And then she just went--they moved there when there when they built a home out in Eastwick when my mother was like in, in elementary school.  And from that time on up she resided there in Eastwick.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 179717
Speaker 1: And did, did you tell us your, your father's name?
Speaker 2: His name was Salam.  His name was S-A-L-M [sic, S-A-L-A-M].
Speaker 1: Okay, S-A-L-A-M?
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: Salam Hassan.
Speaker 2: Abdul.
Speaker 1: Abdul, okay.
Speaker 2: Abdul, un-huh, and I don't know how to spell that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Salam Abdul--
Speaker 2: Hassan.
Speaker 1: Hassan.
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And do you know his birth date or--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't and I feel so bad about that.  And I was asking my sister.  She's about five years my junior.  And she always asks so many questions with mother [Elizabeth Walker], you know, inquiring about our dad.  She, she says you know I don't--he never did share that part with me, you know, but so many other things she was asking.  And I really feel bad about that because all I have--in '92 [1992] [HM] Simeon Booker with Johnson Publications [Johnson Publishing Company] did an article on me with--it was during the when number forty-one, President [George H.W.] Bush, Sr., who my husband had been politically involved with in a number of ways, they were getting ready to go to Somalia, I think that was.  And I had written him a letter asking to be a member of the, the entourage that was going over, because I have, for the last twenty years, have adopted, more or less--through the Children's Christian Fund, I've always had one of the youngsters from Ethiopia, had a girl for about ten years, and now I've got Abraham.  I've had him for about twelve years.  I always send him a little some--you know, you donate a certain amount of money each month.  And I, I always wanted to, if I could go over there, you know, would really like to maybe be fortunate enough to see him or something.  But I still have, I have--I'm kind of reluctant about giving him up, although I've had him and I should go on and try to find another, another, you know--be a sponsor for someone else.
Story_ID: 179718
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about growing up?  Can you kind of reflect about growing up?  Now, what neighborhood did you grow up in?  What was it?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived with my grandmother until I was about thirteen.  That's when my mother [Elizabeth Walker] remarried again, at that time.
Speaker 1: That's in Eastwick [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: That's in Eastwick, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother lived there in Eastwick.
Speaker 1: Well, what was Eastwick like?  Did--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: A small town, something like a Peyton Place, if you ever--(laughter)--
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of black people there?
Speaker 2: Yes, there were quite a few.  And, and it was integrated though, because we lived next door to people who were other than black.  And we went to school with them and all that.  We never really had any, any problems or anything.
Speaker 1: No segregated schools or anything?
Speaker 2: No, not down there in that--at that, at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what, what are some of the sights, and smells, and sounds that you remember from growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I re--let's see, smells I remember 'cause outdoor bathrooms, 'cause I had to clean 'em (laughter).  I was the oldest, so being the oldest, you know, the boys were all under me.  My grandmother was fastidious about everything, and they would come in the summertime to, you know, haul all--like they'd bring things to clean out there.  And we'd have to take hot water and, you know, when she would just go on, and then we'd take the hose and, and do that.  And then we had to sit there and make toilet tissue out of brown paper (laughter) bags.  I was telling something that was asking me because I had started on a book that I wanted to finish, hopefully, "From the Outhouse to the White House."  And they said why you calling that?  I said 'cause that's where I (unclear)--when I was born, we didn't have an indoor plumbing, you know, when I was a little girl.  And I don't remember having that until I was about, oh, say about thirteen, when my first got married.  And we'd have to make the little strip, you know.  And my grandmother, she was met, meticulous housekeeper, and she'd have me--and I said (unclear)--(unclear), you know.  In those days, you do what you were told.  You didn't question it, but I was thinking, you know.  And she'd have--everybody would like to come over to my house to go to the bathroom because it was so nice and clean, and nana would have a, a picture, you know, she had some kind a painting or something (laughter) in there.
Speaker 1: In the bathroom?
Speaker 2: In the bathroom.  And these little papers, you know, all cut, and you'd put a string--you'd put a hole in 'em.  And she'd take a string and tie 'em up on the wall.  'Cause a lot of people, all they had was just plain old newspaper, you know, you know.
Speaker 1: The toilet paper really wasn't invented then.
Speaker 2: No, honey, I don't know if it was invented--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --all I know, we didn't have (laughter)--
Speaker 1: So--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --especially during the Depression time.
Speaker 1: I've heard, I've heard my relatives talk about making toilet paper--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Had they told, had they?  But you--
Speaker 1: Explain how, how you do it.  How do you do it?
Speaker 2: Well, we would--she would get the brown paper bags.  They were--you know, and then she would cut 'em out.  And then we would make 'em in like small--I imagine about three by five or something, you know me, and you'd take 'em and they'd want you to--especially for the younger kids, you know, you'd have to roll 'em up and whatnot, you know, to make 'em kind of soft and whatnot.  And I thought about that, when I had forgotten all about until someone was questioning me about it not too long ago.  And I said yeah, we had the prettiest little outhouse in Eastwick (laughter).  The kids would always wait to come over to my house, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 179719
Speaker 1: Well, what else do you remember in terms, terms of sights, and sounds, and smells?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I remember, you know, growing, and everybody mostly had gardens out there in the backyard.  And you would go out and, and, and pick your--have to--the boys mostly.  They didn't--in family, they didn't make the girls do too much, but the boys would be out there showing 'em how to plant and to do all this type of thing.  I always liked the flowers 'cause my grandmother always loved flowers, you know, roses and all that.  So I kind of learned a lot from her 'cause we live--like I said, we lived with my grandma.  And she had always worked for millionaire people in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  In fact, they had taken her to Europe on several occasions.  The lady that she lived with was from Belgium.  And in fact, when daddy [Salam Hassan] was deported, they wanted to adopt me for, for one.  You know, she was very, very fond of me.  She sent me to dancing school and all the little entities that--amenities that other people, you know, kids I was, I was exposed to 'cause she was very fond of my grandmother.  They had been raised up together, more or less, and as a result, I was very fortunate in, in that area, you know.  But I (unclear)--(unclear)--nothing else that I can remember too much, other than the fact that I always liked to go to church.  And I was--my grandmother was very active in church, and I would be right there with in the revival meetings and all this type of thing.
Story_ID: 179720
Speaker 1: Well now, ma'am, tell me what the community looked like.  I mean what--was it--were the houses close together or far apart or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, they were--you could see some of them were like they were built--I guess you--I don't what, what you would call them.  Most of them were single homes, you know.  And they would sometime like have a duplex, two houses together, then space, and then two more, and then a lot of singles in between, you know, but not too many row houses, so to speak.  They did one of--I think one of the first ones they had was the one that my great-grandparents had, had bought out there, and that was in like a row of homes, you know.  But I don't remember seeing too many of, of those type of homes.
Speaker 1: Did people have a--most people have a car or--
Speaker 2: A lot of the ones who could afford it, you know, but it wasn't too many automobiles there.  They had trolley, they had, they had trolley cars and no buses, just, just the trolleys, you know.  And boy, you'd have those long blocks that you had to (laughter) have to walk in order to get your trolleys, you know, and to go in town to West Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and in Downtown Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 179721
Speaker 1: Okay, now you were telling us about church.  Now what's the name of the church that you attended?
Speaker 2: I attended, I used to attend the mosque when my dad [Salam Hassan] was in, was in, in the country.  I don't remember the name.  But I attended Beulah Baptist Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and that was the church where I was baptized when I was nine years old, and that was quite a church.  And in fact, I, I understand now that that was the church that Patti LaBelle used to sing in the choir there.  And the young lady that, who used to be minister of music, she, who is now deceased, she and I were in, were both members of that church when we were coming up.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did, now did you have any special roles in the church?  Were you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, no, I was active in the church, you know, in terms of being in plays.  And I always wanted to singe on the choir with my best friend, but when they found out who was out of tune, it was me (laughter), and they put me out.  So I wound up being in the, in, in some other area.  They would make me like an usher or doing some other chores.  But I just enjoyed going to church so much.  Yeah, it was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it was one of my favorite pastimes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --even up until my teenage years--
Story_ID: 179722
Speaker 1: When you were a little girl, what did you like to do, and what kind of a little girl were you?
Speaker 2: Well, for one thing, I always liked cooking (laughter).  And being the oldest, you know, when my mother [Elizabeth Walker] had--there were times when my mother, although she had a good education, she couldn't find work, you know, and she'd have to go to work, like doing days work and things of this nature.  And when I got to be around ten, I was able to--with the help of my great-grandfather, you know, I would--my helping with the kids and whatnot, 'cause he was the chief, the chief sitter.  And I always did like to cook and, and do it.  He would let me experiment with things.  I never forget the first time I made a cake, I forgot to put the baking power in.  And when they, and when they came home, my mother, which is his granddaughter, and, and my grandmother, and we had--I had made the cake and the cake had three layers and (unclear)--(unclear) being that.  And they took way--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --and he was just praising me to the highest.  And they looked at each other, and they--they called him papa--and they said well, papa, did you eat that?  Yeah, and so they were worried because, I mean I (unclear) he was up in age, you know, and they felt he probably was gonna get ill or something for that.  But I--those were the kind of things, and look at after my brothers and sisters.
Story_ID: 179723
Speaker 1: Okay, now where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to school in--well, after, after my mother [Elizabeth Walker] married, we moved from (unclear) and went out to West Philadelphia, and that's where I went to school, in, in West Philadelphia, West Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Well, I'm talking about grade school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, that was McKean Elementary School [Edinboro, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: McKey?
Speaker 2: McKean, M-C-K-E-A-N.  That was the same school that my mother had gone to, there in Eastwick.
Speaker 1: How did you like school?
Speaker 2: I was very fond of school, always was, and did very well in school.  In fact, I skipped a couple of grades when I was in elementary school.  And I--something like--they didn't have to--if I--if, if it was some reason that I had to stay away from school then I was just out of it, you know.  For any reason, if I had to miss school I was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: My favorite subjects were history and math.  And I didn't do as good in English, English as I could have because I had problems with my enunciation, you know.  And again, when I was little, I used to speak--my dad [Salam Hassan] spoke to me in Italian most of the time when he was in this country.  And in fact, up until I was about five years old when he was deported, I spoke mostly Italian with him.  And I found that when I got ready--after he left, you know, I had no one to speak it with, and my enunciation was very poor, you know.  And I think I went, kind of went in a shell, so to speak, after my dad was deported, you know.
Story_ID: 179724
Speaker 1: --Can you speak any Italian now?  Do you, do you remember--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Very--not really, you know.  And I--when I, when I was in junior high school, I attempted--my mom [Elizabeth Walker] wanted me to major in, in languages.  And I guess, just to be rebellious, you know, (laughter), I said no.  I took French for about a year, and I said oh, the heck with this.  I'll never have--why will I--when will I ever get to use it, you know?  And she used to tell me all the time about how the small the wor--she was such a brilliant lady--how small the world would be getting.  She says, and you know, she says not that you'd wanna pass for anything else, but if you knew, you look like one of those people.  She says and if you can speak their language--and it was so true because late--later on when I came here to, on the East Coast, I worked at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  And I know when they were having some problems in trying to get something done--they had this big King Tut exhibit out in San Francisco [California], and we had, you know, communication with the people, and, and they couldn't seem to really come to--[clearing throat]--any type of agreement over the phone.  And I agreed to go over and talk to them.  And I went over to the embassy here in Washington, and when I got through, they offered me a job (laughter).  They wanted me to come.  And, and although I told 'em, I said well, I don't speak any, any foreign language at all.  They said well, you know you can always go to school, you know, and, and learn.  I said oh, true, I could, you know.  But I just seem to have a, kind of a, camaraderieship with, with some of those people and whatnot.
Story_ID: 179725
Speaker 1: Now are there any teachers in grade school that stand out as being, that you (simulteanoues]--
Speaker 2: I had a couple of teachers that--one, Mrs.--I never will forget.  I think she was Polish, Mrs. Oleansis [ph.].  She was--I don't even know how to spell that.  But she was very fond of me and, and I of her, and I would--she would always let me stay after school with her, do little chores and those type of things and whatnot.  But I never had too much problems in, in going to school with any of my teachers.  Only one I had any, really problems was when I high school was the art teacher because I could never draw, and I didn't even try (laughter), wouldn't attempt.  I knew I wasn't gonna get a, a--that's what kept me off the honor roll.  I never was gonna get a P in art, you know.  So I got so I didn't even try (laughter).  But no, she and there's another teacher.  I'm trying to think of her name.  But that one stands out in my mind 'cause I had her for the second and the third grade, and those were very important times in my life.
Story_ID: 179726
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about high school now.  You went to--
Speaker 2: I went to West Philadelphia High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And at that time my mother [Elizabeth Walker] was, had remarried.  And when I was in my senior year, my mother had to take me out of school because she was pregnant, and at the time, she needed someone to be at home to kind of look after the kids 'cause she couldn't depend on my stepfather, you know, when he would be there or not.  And I came out in the twelfth grade, and I didn't graduate.  I really had enough credits, I understand, to, to have graduated then.  But I went back, but I--for about three months and then I stopped.  My class was graduating ahead of me, so I really never got my diploma, and it never did make any difference 'cause I've gotten--well, I did, I lied on my--you know, when you put down, you say that you graduate, and I put it down there.  So evidently they--I said well, I don't know if they'll find.  If they do, I'll just have to come and tell the truth.  But all that time that I've gone I've always been like a self-starter, could teach myself, you know.  And I said to myself, now what if I'd have really--my mother kept saying why don't you go back to school and get your, you know?  So I said well, why did you ever take me out and let me miss (laughter)--not graduate with my class, you know.  But I've been very fortunate about being able to pass tests and to be able to get positions, you know, that really put me in--and to teach myself.  Like I said, I went all the way up to the White House, working as an administrative assistant, you know.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that stand out at West Philadelphia High School that really took an interest in your or that you really admired?
Speaker 2: I can't even remember, to tell you the truth--that there was a Mr. Tatum [ph.] who was my French teacher in junior high school, and he was quite a fun guy to be with.  And he was so disappointed with me when I didn't continue on taking French.  But in high school, per se, in West Philadelphia High School there's none that I really remember that well.
Story_ID: 179727
Speaker 1: So what did you do after high school?  Did you have any career objectives already?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was always interested in business.  You know, I took commercial--and that's just like business management.  And then I went on to work for the--I went into the government to work, and worked there for a while, was able to--as a result of taking a test, they gave me a good position.  And then I stayed in the government for a couple of years, and then I went to work for an African American newspaper there in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], 'cause I always liked writing and this type of thing.  And I worked at The [Philadelphia] Tribune, and I also worked at another paper called The [Philadelphia] Independent.  And then shortly after that, I got married and had my daughter, and then I kept on working, worked--and went into government and worked at the Philadelphia Quartermaster Depot, and worked there until I went to California in 1950.
Story_ID: 179728
Speaker 1: Now how did you meet your husband [HM Arthur Fletcher]?
Speaker 2: Well, I went out to California.  I had married before, and I went out to California.  And then I was married about eight years, and then we divorced.  And then I was just single working, and I met--
Speaker 1: About what year is that?
Speaker 2: That was in 19--in the, in the early '60s [1960s] when I met him.  And then he was teaching school there in, in Berkeley, California, and I was a, a bookkeeper at a large food store.  And as a result, he was a widower with five kids.  And he would come to the store, and, and I met him through a mutual friend, really, friend of his that knew me also, and that's how we met.  And I became friendly with his little boys.  Baby boy was about twelve years old, and he was the one that really put us together (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you got married in what year?
Speaker 2: We got--'64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right, and you didn't have, have any children--
Speaker 2: Just the one.  I had one daughter--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --twenty years-old, yes, with two little grandchildren at the time that--and one was a year, one was one was two; mm-hmm, they were just babies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was a young grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I'm a great-grandmother now.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I've got nine great-grandkids.
Story_ID: 179729
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you've been civically involved in a lot of different things and even--
Speaker 2: I have.
Speaker 1: --worked in the White House.  So, can, can you give us some of the highlights of your, of your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to--when I married Mr. Fletcher [HM Arthur Fletcher] we moved up to the state of Washington.  And he--I went to work up there from Batelle Northwest [sic, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington], one of the atomic energy business in Richland, Washington, and worked there for quite a while.  Then he had elected to help him to get elected to--well, let me backtrack.  We went up there, we went up there.  I had worked as a--in the co-op as a bookkeeper and as an educational assistant.  So we, together, he and I, we organized this self-help co-op, and I was able to be of invaluable, he says, help to him by my background in the education department while I worked at the co-op.  So, as a result, I worked side by side with him in this, and then he got elected to the city council there, and then went on to run in 1968 for lieutenant government of the state of Washington, so then I became a candidate's wife (laughter), and worked very hard.  That, in fact we were in Seattle [Washington] last month.  The governor [Daniel Evans], who served three terms, and when the governor who Mr. Fletcher ran on the ticket with was the only--he, Mr. Fletcher was the only member of the team that didn't get elected.  That's one of the few states in the United States that have, can have a governor and a lieutenant governor of different party affiliations.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: I think Ohio used to be like that too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I think Virginia is.  You got just a few.  I don't think they have more than six.  I don't--I should do some research and find out 'cause people are always asking me.
Story_ID: 179730
Speaker 1: But that was one of the things, and that was quite a, quite a tenure for--so as a result of that, by him being active in politics even before he met me in Kansas, where he was from--because he was very active in board, Brown v. The Board of Education [1954] and raised for money for them, so as a result, we've been a, just on a fast track ever since he and I have been married, you know.  We came back here in '69 [1969] here, I mean Washington, when he was in the [President Richard] Nixon Administration.  And I didn't do anything at that time; I just stayed at home, and I traveled with him quite a bit when he was, you know, traveling and whatnot, and then went on--I did go back to work.  I worked at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for a while, for a couple of years, went in there on a special project.  And they liked me so well, and liked the work that I did, they, they kept me there, and then I came out because I had to go have surgery.  And then when the Reagan and Bush ticket--I mean [Ronald] Reagan-[George H.W.] Bush team was elected [1980], they asked me to come in, and offered me a job on Mrs. [Nancy] Reagan's staff, you know.
Story_ID: 179731
Speaker 1: They knew--well, I should backtrack.  We started--we opened our business in '63 [1963], Mr. Fletcher [HM Arthur Fletcher] and I, after he left the United Negro College Fund, and I ran our, I managed our office.  We had a la--government relations firm.  And then from there we went into government contracting.  So I was manager of that, and then I, in '81 [1981] I went in to work for Mrs. [Nancy] Reagan as her administrative assistant.  And I understand I was the first black women to ever hold a job of this nature.  And it was quite an enjoyable time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, so you were--how long did you work for Mrs. Reagan?
Speaker 1: I worked--first I went into help organize the private sector initiatives for President [Ronald] Reagan.  And as a result, we, Mrs. Reagan's chief of staff, the young man she had brought with her from California, he left, went back, and then my boss was, was sent over to be the chief, and I went with him to help him organize that team.  And I stayed about almost two years, then I left after two years.
Story_ID: 179732
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was--did you get a chance to interact much with Nancy Reagan?
Speaker 2: Well, not too much, I hate say; I really didn't.  I was the only African American in the position that I had; had another young lady who was just a secretary to the social secretary.  And I more or less just was assistant to my boss who was chief of staff.  And he was gone a lot, so I managed the office.  And I had a, oh, about--volunteers, I had about ten volunteers that I had set up to come and help me with my work.  But I was mostly on the phones with the [U.S.] Congress and whatnot and back and forth.  But it was a very learned position, and I enjoyed it very much.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have any sense for what [President Ronald] Reagan was like?
Speaker 2: I, only thing I can say is he's a very pleasant gentleman.  I used to see him in the halls all the time.  And for some reason, and I don't know what he thought I was, but he always would speak to me (unclear)--like he's seeing me for the first time.  But he was a very pleasant, pleasant person, yes.
Story_ID: 179733
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now are you a lifelong Republican?
Speaker 2: I'm neither.
Speaker 1: Neither, okay.
Speaker 2: I've been an Independent all my life.  I'll never forget the first time that I went to register when I was eighteen.  And my mom [Elizabeth Walker] wanted to question me.  You know, I told you she was very active in politics.  And when I came back I would tell her, but I said it very nicely.  I didn't say it smart.  She said, "Well, did you register to vote?"  I said I sure did.  And she said well, what did you do?  I said I don't think I have to tell anybody what I am (laughter), but I had registered.  I was an Independent.  I don't believe in party labels.  I believe in voting for the individual, you know.
Speaker 1: That makes sense.  A lot black leadership--well, since the nineteenth century, black leaders have been calling for that stance, that we shouldn't be--
Speaker 2: That's right.  I think so.  That's the problem now.  We've got more--if you got them all in one party, they just take it for granted, right?  So, I tell 'em when, when (unclear)--whenever I meet with any of them or they wanna know my feelings, 'cause I'm a very outspoken person because I believe--I don't like people guessing what I'm say--you know.  And that's just the way I feel about it, and I think people have more respect for you.  You don't have to like me, but you do have to respect me, you know.
Speaker 1: I think 19--the 1960 election, as far as I can remember--correct me if you think I'm wrong--is probably the last time that the black community was split on a candidate, I mean was kind of split between Republicans and Democrats.
Speaker 2: Right, it was in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: And prior to that, most black folks were voting for FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], you know.
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: That's what he came to change.
Speaker 2: I remember that distinctly because I remember the Depression time.  Although I was a youngster, I remember, you know, because we had to go and, and get food, you know, that they were giving out, this free food and stuff like that, (unclear) cans that didn't have no labels on 'em, you know what I mean, and all this type of thing.  So a lot of people went for--they thought Franklin--DR was the savior, you know, more or less.
Story_ID: 179734
Speaker 1: Okay, and--well, the '60 [1960] election, I know black people were, were debating about [Richard] Nixon and [John F.] Kennedy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, they were, they were.
Speaker 1: Where in the subsequent years there was no debate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't any debate.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know why they were so, they were so anti about Mr. Nixon, 'cause there was a lot of good things that Mr. Nixon did.  In fact, my husband [HM Arthur Fletcher] was a part of the subcabinet when he was able to get the affirmative action through, you know.  But I don't--they seemed to wanna keep it quiet.  They didn't want people to know what they were doing or something, you know.
Speaker 1: But he was trying to court a different constituency (laughter)--
Speaker 2: That's true (laughter).
Speaker 1: --I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That might be it.  I'm just offering--
Speaker 2: I, that's all I can say.  But I know that he was--my husband could not, not have done what he did if it hadn't have been, you know, if the president hadn't been aware of it, because he told Artie, says, "Art," for one thing--he had a lot of respect for my husband.  And my husband is a, is quite a, a man of integrity, and he had been a football player also, you know, and Nixon was crazy about football.  And they'd tell me that lots of times when Fletcher would go over to the White House--because you're only allow a--you know, with all the people that the president has to see, and I know how that was after I went over there to work.  You know, if you stay fifteen minutes or half an hour, you know, you have to kind of let him know 'cause you have other appointments.  And the thing of it, of course of the matter was they said they'd have to probably drag Fletcher out 'cause President Nixon would wanna talk to him about other things, about football too, you know, (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you get to know Nixon very well?
Speaker 2: I did.  We went there--of all the presidents that my husband (unclear), we were there on different occasions, for dinner and for performances while Mr. Nixon was president.  And I liked, I liked Mrs. [Pat] Nixon very much, very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 179735
Speaker 1: Now did you know [President Dwight D.] Eisenhower at all--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, that--my husband knew him because he played football with President Eisenhower's nephew.  See, they were all from Kansas and whatnot.  I didn't meet any of the presidential folks until I came here in '69 [1969].  You know, I was just a little peon, a little worker there in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], before.
Story_ID: 179736
Speaker 1: Let's see, so, so you were, you were with--did you serve in the [George H.W.] Bush Administration at all, or did--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't go in to the Bush at all.  My husband [HM Arthur Fletcher] went in.  He served as the U.S. Chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission [sic, United States Commission on Civil Rights].  He was the one that, that went out, you know, to Los Angeles when they had the Rodney King Hearings and all these type of things.  And they were trying to revitalize that at that time, because it had kind of gone downhill, you know.  And then some of 'em were--the guy, the person who was there before, he didn't wanna step down so my husband could take over, you know, over the, over the commission.  But see, my husband and, and Bush had known each other since Bush ran for, I think it was the Senate in Texas, 'cause they go all the way back to the--when Bush was head chairman of the Republican Party, Mr. Fletcher served as a consultant to him.  Then they went over to the UN together.  They were at the United Nations together.  In fact, they were there the year the People's Republic of China came in.  I was fortunate enough to go over to the United Nations and stand up there, and, and was able to see them when they drove up, and the People's Republic of China came in and was entered back into the United Nations.   So it's been a lot of, a lot of interesting things that I've done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 179737
Speaker 1: What's the-what's your favorite story about--
Speaker 2: Well, I think one of my favorite stories, when I think back on it now, is when my husband [HM Arthur Fletcher] was running for lieutenant governor in the state of Washington.  And he won the primary, oh, by a, a huge margin, and, and, and, and was not elected in the general by less than about two percent.  And I forget the exact number of African Americas were in that state, but it was a very minute number that were in there.  And that--the late--I know you've heard of Ted Bundy.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well, Ted Bundy was one of the young men who drove my husband around when he was campaigning for lieutenant governor.
Speaker 1: Now Ted Bundy was a serial killer, wasn't he?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that was, that was after he was with us.  But anyway, Ted Bundy had even stayed at our home in--
Speaker 1: What did they call him, the, the Hillside Strangler--
Speaker 2: Or something.
Speaker 1: -or something like that?
Speaker 2: Some name, and it was shocking to me because the young man had stayed in my home, you know--and very respectful young man, and he was quite fond of Mr. Fletcher, you know.
Speaker 1: He's a, from what I understand, Bundy was a handsome guy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, he was a hand--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and the girls were crazy about him (unclear); he was handsome, yes he was.  And--
Speaker 1: Even when he was on trial, women were trying to date him.
Speaker 2: They were, they really were, and I was just shocked when I heard about it.  You know, we were back here, and people even--I think the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] interviewed Mr. Fletcher about it because they saw his name in some of his writings and, and whatnot, you know.  They interviewed me.  But Ted did, he, he, Ted slept in my home, you know, and that's why I said I can't see this kid being--he was so mannerable and what have you.  And I told my husband, said them girls, I said they might have been asking for a little trouble because they were after him like, like nothing, you know.  But we were--when I, when I reflect back on, on some of the things that we've done, you know, and it was kind of a danger time because we used to get all kind of threatening calls when Mr. Fletcher was running up there, 'cause there was not that many African Americans in the whole state, you know.  And they used to get a lot of threatening calls about people were, what they were gonna do to us.  We used to lay on the floor at the house and all kind of crazy stuff, you know.  But he did, he really, he drove Mr. Fletcher all over the state.  He belonged to this Action for Washington group.  He was a member of that.  In fact, a lot of those youngsters over in school, they were the ones who really got Mr. Fletcher through the primary.

Speaker 1: When did you retire career-wise from--
Speaker 2: When did I retire?
Speaker 1: Yeah, from, you know, a career?  I mean you were actually working in the White House and that sort of thing, did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I came--after I came--[clearing throat] from the White House, I went back to work with Mr. Fletcher [HM Arthur Fletcher] because he had a, had received the government contract.  And I worked there with him for a while.  And I'm supposed to be retired bow, but I'm not.  If you come over to my house you can see how it looks like--(laughter)--I talking about the Library of Congress (laughter), that's what it looks like, trying to get situated and what not.  Well, me, I enjoy working with my husband because he's a very interesting person, and I respect him to the highest, and I'm in tune with what he's trying to do, you know.  So, and I like working with young people.  So, I say I fuss at him sometimes about my house not being like I want it when--but I've overlooked that now, you know.  Oh, it's gonna be here when I'm gone.  Look, it's more important things to do.
Story_ID: 179739
Speaker 1: All right, what are some of your favorite causes?
Speaker 2: Youngsters, children really are my favorite.  There's--my favorite, little ones, you know preschoolers and up until they get about in the fourth, fifth grade.  'Cause once they get, get past that, they're not easy to deal with.  But I love little children.
Story_ID: 179740
Speaker 1: Could you name some of the organizations you, you volunteer for?
Speaker 2: I belong to the Children's Defense [Fund], Ms. Edelman's [HM Marian Wright Edelman].  I sent money to them, and I sent money to a lot of different organizations.  It's not a lot, but I try to spread it around to the little ones.  But I have so many of my own, and I have so many children who have adopted me as a grandparent and a mother, so I told Mr. Fletcher [HM Arthur Fletcher] we don't--I'm like a universal mother really and that it's an honor.  A lot of my friends say why do you have somebody like that calling you mother?  I said well, none of--I didn't ask them to call me mother, but if they thought enough to call me mother, that's an honor, you know.  And I spend a lot of time with my, with, with my family 'cause together we have about--Mr. Fletcher had five children when I married, and he has--three of his children have predeceased him.  But we, together, we have quite a number.  I don't even know how many we have, to tell you truth.  But we have quite a few here on the East Coast.  And I had come up from a large family with my mother's [Elizabeth Walker] second husband and her (unclear)--their, their children, and they have children, so I've got quite a, quite a conglomerate of, of youngsters to deal with.  In fact, I need--I told him I have no more discretionary money.  That little bit of Social Security (laughter)-what-not have, well, I try to spread that out as much as I can.  But I enjoy being with children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 179741
Speaker 1: --I wanted to ask you about the Civil Rights Movement in 19--well, let's start with, well I guess you can start where, wherever you want, but like what--how, how do you feel about, did, did you feel about that, 'cause you lived through the whole--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I--in my way--in our way, I should say, with my mother [Elizabeth Walker] and I, we were always involved in civil rights to a degree, and we always tried to get along with people, and, and we always had people--our house was just so much like a United Nations.  We have all--'cause I have, right now I have several girls who are other than, than, than African Americans.  They call me mom.  The little girls who's running the mayor of Renton, out in Renton, Washington [Kathy Keolker-Wheeler], I help to raise her up, really.  I met her when she was about ten, and her mother and her were always at odds, 'cause I used to keep her at my house all the time.  And after her mother passed, she, she (unclear), she'll come all the way from Washington State to visit me.  And I've got other in other parts of the country.  They just gravitate toward me.  And I say I'm colorblind.  I don't see colors.  I see people, you know, and that's one of the reasons why they were teasing me.  Not too long ago, they were start teasing me about the fact some, some of 'em knew my dad [Salam Hassan] was Arab, you know.  And I said well, I can't--you know, you can't, you can't pick, you don't pick your father, you know.  They pick you.  So I said but the thing about it, we all have to live in this, in this world together.  And when we say love, and when God says love, He mean, that means you respect and love people like you love yourself, and then we can be able to get along, you know.  And like I said, I was just hoping--this war over there is a holy war that's going on over there.  And see, I read--I try to read some parts of the Bible every day, and I read it, and when I read the Bible, all this comes back to me as to what's going on.  And as a little girl, having been around, around religious Christian women and a great-grandfather who was a Christian, see, this was always instilled in me, you know, irrespective of the fact that my dad was, was Muslim, you know.  And I don't know what his feeling was.  All I knew that he, he, he was disappointed because he said there was so much racism in the country.  It tickled me when I, and I'll never forget when I went over to South Africa.  I've only been to one part in African, and that was South Africa.  We went over to--Dr. Fletcher [HM Arthur Fletcher] and I went over to--I went over to assist him with, with a conference, and it was right before [Nelson] Mandela was, was inaugurated.  And we didn't have time enough to stay over thee because Mr. Fletcher had to get back to the United States.  And I look and people would say to me, they would tease me.  They wanna know where are you from, you know?  I said I'm from the United States, but I knew they were wanting to ask me something else, you know.  So I said no, I'm not from--I'm from--my father's from Africa, but he's from East Africa.  And I said, you know what, I said I, I always said that I always wanted to visit that country one of these days, you know, see if I could maybe see some of my father's people, you know.  But I said you know, I've come to the conclusion that we're all God's children, so don't make that, don't make that difference.  Wherever I am, I'll try to do some of his work, you know, and that's one of the reasons why I took it upon myself to adopt, so to speak--saying it's not much that I send to those kids monthly, but it's just as much as that I can afford with all the other kids that I have, you know, in my family.
Story_ID: 179742
Speaker 1: Now what did you think about [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.]?
Speaker 2: I thought he was a remarkable gentleman.  I really did have the utmost respect for him and what he was trying to do.  It took a lot.  You know, we in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], we're doing our own little way of doing things, you know, in terms of, of civil rights, you know, trying to educate people.  But what you gotta do, you gotta communicate.  In order to know a person, you've gotta communicate with them; you've gotta talk with them, you know; you've gotta socialize with them to a respect.  But we were always taught about respect as little kids, you know, and we always had kids of all colors running in and out of my house, and I guess that was a lot.  Because when my dad was a seaman, I remember all nationalities coming in, you know.  And, and you've have, you'd, you'd have those people of all different colors, you know, and they all got along fine, or appeared to get along fine.
Story_ID: 179743
Speaker 1: Who are some of the more remarkable people you've met along the way?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had the good fortune of meeting Fannie Lou Hamer.  Do you, you remember her?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, Mrs. Hamer, I really--I met her when I was out in Washington State, and I thought--
Speaker 1: She was made organizer in--
Speaker 2: Organizer there in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: --Mississippi for--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the Democratic Party--
Speaker 2: That's right, right.
Speaker 1: --in '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: I've had to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I've, I met Jackie Robinson in person.  I mean, when I say met 'em, to talk to them, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and they were--I knew of them because I had, you know, I had been exposed to them.  My play brother-in-law, the late Earl "Fatha" Hines, who was quite a musician as--knew him from--his wife and I were raised up together, and I lived with him for a while.  And in fact, my oldest--
Speaker 1: In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?  In--
Speaker 2: Yeah, un-huh, my oldest grandson is his godchild.  And I was the one who went out when, when Fatha passed, I went out and buried, took care of all the burial arrangements for him.  He was a very special person in me--in my life.
Story_ID: 179744
Speaker 1: So I've met--oh, God, who haven't I met?  I've met a lot, I met quite a few of 'em, some of 'em I didn't care too much for, but I respected them (laughter).
Speaker 2: Who, which ones--
Speaker 1: I just don't like--
Speaker 2: --that you didn't--
Speaker 1: --phony.
Speaker 2: --care for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I ain't gon' tell you.  You know, I, you know, I--
Speaker 2: This is history now.
Speaker 1: I know, but I just can't--you know, I think that people want--young people want you to be, they want you to be honest with them, you know.  You know, you don't sit up and tell them don't do this, when, you knew--when, you know, I was your age, and I did such and such a thing, and I can relate to that, you know what I mean?  Like I tell my kids, I wasn't born as old as I am.  Grandma, you know, said I was rebellious, and you know, I did things I wasn't supposed to do.  But the thing is, what I think they want, and I think to why they gravitate toward me and care for me, 'cause I tell 'em the truth, you know.  So, I mean I don't get down on 'em.  I said I just wanna try to make your life easier for you.  If I can share some of my experiences, you know, 'cause now I wish that a lot of things my grandmother tried to get me to do I wish I had of done.  I'd have been that much further down the road, you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And I was--and I think about it, I've been quite fortunate because my father was taken away from me, but God--I always find He never takes one--if one thing goes, He's always--how do, how do I wanna put it?  He always surprise you with something else.  Like I had a great-grandfather, you know.  And, and the kind of person that I was, outgoing, and I loved people--'cause mother [Elizabeth Walker] used to say daddy [Salam Hassan] said he was gonna pick a husband for me, you know, when I got to be a grown--she said oh, my God, your father would have killed you (laughter).  I said why?  You are, you know, you're so opinionated; you got your own mind.  I say well, did he--did anybody pick you for him?  I didn't say it smart like, you know.  And she said see, that was the thing that would have got you in (laughter), would have got you in trouble.  But I was fortunate enough to have a moth--grandmother and a grandfather who loved me dearly, loved us dearly, and who didn't mind sharing and doing for me, 'cause I had a very good mother.  She was a lovely woman, you know, so--
Story_ID: 179745
Speaker 1: Now what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: My concerns is for them to be able to get themselves together, to get to--they're, they're not--I don't want--not all speaking of one mind, but to realize the, the importance of politics, that it pays in life regard of what--regardless of whether you wanna be involved or not, you know.  Because when--like I tell 'em, your tax dollars, you mean--you have to pay taxes, and you should be involved to the point where you should be able to, to have a say so in what goes on, you know.  And the thing about the children, getting their priorities in order, be able to separate their needs from their wants, you know what I mean?  Like my brother and my sisters will, or some of relatives, (unclear)--(unclear)--you got so and so.  I said let me tell you something, no, what I have is priorities.  Sure, there was a lot of times I might wanna go out and spend three or 400 dollars for a dress, can't afford it because I got other things that I have to do.  And we gotta make sacrifices; we gotta make--look out for other people, you know what I mean?  So that's one of my great, my greatest concerns that I have for, for African American people, you know, on the whole, you know, and be able to respect each other, you know.
Story_ID: 179746
Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things that you've done and been involved with, with, with your husband [HM Arthur Fletcher] and other people, what, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I --the one thing I like to remember people is--I'd like people to remember me as being an individual who was not an--was a positive person who always looked at life on the positive side.  And if anything that I can do to help them or to share in any way, I was more than willing to do.  And the thing that I, I respect about me, I don't wait.  If I see something that needs to be done, I don't feel like you have to wait and, and have that person ask you or, or listening to me seems to take something away from someone that they have to come and ask you for something, you know.  I feel as though if they really come and ask, they really need it, but that's not always true, you know.  But the thing that I have is to try to share with each other, and, and to live like, like the Bible tells you, the Bible that I read, that tells you about, you know, about loving your neighbor as yourself, and, and, and, and honoring your, your folks.  When it says honor your mother and your father, that also means senior people, and being to have a goal in life, you know.  And that to me is more important than anything else.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much--
Speaker 2: Well, you're most welcome.
Speaker 1: --for sharing your time with us.
Speaker 2: God bless you.
Speaker 1: Alright.
