Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of her.
Speaker 1: Do you have any memories of her--
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: --I mean, I know you left her at two years old.
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't very good 'cause I had a--see when you're coming up in an orphanage [Colored Orphan Asylum, New York, New York], you're always told that your mother don't want you, you're not gonna be anything, so I had very negative feelings about her.  And I, I remember one time saying to her, a thing like her couldn't be my mother, (laughter) you know.  So I was very, it was a, I'm, I've never had that love or affection--
Speaker 1: Do you know--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, that's, I had no feelings.
Speaker 1: Do you know what her circumstances may have been?
Speaker 2: Never, never, never know, I don't, I think, in talking to my sister [Edna Ryan], that she came over when she was thirteen, and but I, that I don't know.  And I just have to more or not go by what she's telling me.  And I, under the circumstances my birth certificate right now I can't get to it, so then I probably would get it, have a little bit more information in reference to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well then, what, of your father, your father's name?
Speaker 2: I know nothing of him, never saw him.  Don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you know his name though?

Story_ID: 352107
Speaker 1: So you were placed into foster care at age two?
Speaker 2: In 19- 1922.
Speaker 1: Nineteen twenty-two [1922].
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Were you with a specific foster family or were you--
Speaker 2: No, I was in a New York Nursery and Child [New York Nursery and Child's Hospital, New York, New York].  And it's hard for me to really recollect then, that.  I do know that I can remember an el [elevated train] and I think there was an undertaker underneath, underneath the building.  And I, it was steps you had to go to.  And I do remember you had the gaslight, you didn't have electricity.  So, that's, the, I can, and I was very, very young.  Then I went to a woman called Miss Preston [ph.] in Jamaica [Queens, New York], Long Island [New York].
Speaker 1: And what--
Speaker 2: She was the first person that I can somewhat (unclear) remember.
Speaker 1: Like how old were you when you went to Miss Preston?
Speaker 2: Well, old enough I believe to go to school, old enough to go to school.  And I lived with her for a period of, a time.
Speaker 1: Now did you spend any time in the colored orphanage, orphan society [Colored Orphan Asylum, New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, off and on, yeah, when they'd (unclear) you.  I lived in about, let's see.  I lived in, I can say I started out on the East Side.  I, and, and from the East Side I went to Jamaica.  Then I went to Springfield Gardens [Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Who was in Springfield Gardens?
Speaker 2: A woman named Miss Thornton [ph.].  And then from, then I went to Peekskill [New York] with the, with Peekskill.  And then I went with Reverend Keirnan [ph.].  And then I, you know, more or not became age, that's when my mother [Amy Darby (ph.)] took me out the, took me out, I was old enough to go to work, so that's what I think, that's what, what happened, that's when I became very, very rebellious.  I was a rebellious child anyway 'cause I used to run away too, so.
Speaker 1: Why--?
Speaker 2: I resented the, you know, because just when you were seemed to get some settlement, then you were moved so it makes you, makes you rebellious, um-hum, yeah.  So, I think of many of the kids who are in foster care today, got, what, what they, what they're facing, it's not easy.  And then you're told, and when I was coming along you're not gonna be nothing, your mother's not, was nothing, you're not gonna be anything, and I always wanted to be a little better than her.  So, I wanted to be a doctor really that's, that's what always upset me that that part of my life was cut off.
Speaker 1: So when you were moving from--
Speaker 2: Place to place.
Speaker 1: --place to place--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was there any, any family members that you--
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: --biological family members that you--
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: --had contact with?
Speaker 2: I never saw them.
Speaker 1: Never saw them.
Speaker 2: I never saw them 'til I think I was about fifteen, so I, I just never saw them.
Speaker 1: Your mother's mother, did you know her?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother?
Speaker 2: No, no, none of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Story_ID: 352108
Speaker 1: So do you remember first grade, going to the, the first time you were able to go to school?
Speaker 2: Well I, I remember I, I remember the first school I went to was P.S. 40 [P.S. 040 Samuel Huntington] in Queens [New York].  So I think, I think if I remember on Union Hall Street.  Yeah, that was the first school that I went to and I seem to have gone somewhere along the lines, the only school I ever graduated from. The eighth grade.  And I don't know how that happened, I do have a diploma, if I ever come, can get my stuff out of storage.  But I remember that was the only school that I graduated from.
Speaker 1: So do you feel you were treated, I mean, as, as a foster child were you treated differently?
Speaker 2: Oh, you are.  In the foster care, yeah, because generally it, when I was coming along in foster care, many of the people in Jamaica [Queens, New York] bought homes and it was you, you were sort of an, an income for those people so it's, it's pretty hard.  Some were good, my, my press, my first foster parent was good.  But not all of 'em, and then you always felt like, as you got older that you were just the maid for their children, you know.  So it, it, it's hard to say, yet, you never know if you're, you know, if you were, it was, the opposite that what, what, in raising children it's, it's, it's not easy for anyone (laughter).
Speaker 1: So when you were in school, when you were in school were there any teachers who, that you looked up too or served as any type of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --role models for who you would become?
Speaker 2: No, not really because when I was in school they were all white teachers.  We had, we, it was, she was just a teacher.  But there were mostly, I, I, I don't know if I ever, all I knew is that I wanted to be somebody that's, when I say be somebody, I didn't wanna be like my mother [Amy Darby (ph.)] and I wanted to know, and during that period, I just didn't, I, I feel sorry for children that are split up, nowadays you're just having divorces and people have babies and be, each one goes different direction.  But it's very, very hard on a child.
Story_ID: 352109
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you go to church during this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes I went to A.M.E. Zion Church [Rush Temple African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, Jamaica, New York].  In fact, oh, golly, you had, you have Reverend Flakes [sic. HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake] now is the head of the church but where he is now, that's not where we would go to church.  We went to church, I, I can't remember the street but it was in a different section.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the church again, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: The A.M.E. Zion.
Speaker 1: And where was it located?
Speaker 2: In, in, in, I can remember the street and everything where the church was but I don't remember the, the exact name, the exact place, the street, must be the street.  I think it was more or not on the avenue.  But if I ever said I ever got out to Jamaica [Queens, New York] and talked to people they could easily, you know, tell me where, where the church was, now it's somewhere else.
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of your life?
Speaker 2: In, in the foster care, yeah.  You always went to Sunday school.
Story_ID: 352110
Speaker 1: So where did you end up going to junior high school to receive--
Speaker 2: Oh, (unclear).
Speaker 1: --your diploma?
Speaker 2: I, well, I got my, I don't know, I, and it's still a mystery, I, I never know how I got back to the eighth grade at, at [P.S. 040 Samuel Huntington], in to Jamaica [Queens, New York].  That I, I don't know.  I went to Peekskill [New York] and I went to Drum Hill [Drum Hill Junior High School].  I went to Oakside [Oakside Elementary School, Peekskill, New York] which was a, I think a grammar school.  Went to Oakside and then I, I'm trying to recollect now, I went to Peekskill and I don't, it's sort of confused there because I went to Peekskill and I was supposed to go into high school there which I always tell people, I never went to high school but in that fuzzy, I don't remember, I don't seem to remember exactly.  But I know there was Drum Hill, Oakside, and Drum, Drum Hill I can remember.  And, and then now, oh, golly, you know, you're making me think.  Then I went to Sparkill [New York].  I, I was in, also in Sparkill.  And I went to some (unclear) or somewhere along the line I must have, I went to high school.  But truthfully I just don't remember that, you know.
Speaker 1: So after you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And when you start talking, you know, you, yeah, you make me, you make me think of things that I hadn't thought about.
Story_ID: 352111
Speaker 1: When you leave the eighth grade [at Drum Hill Junior High School, Peekskill, New York], and you were how old when you graduated eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Oh, I assume that it had to be, I don't know, probably fourteen, fifteen, 'cause I had my daughter [Joyce Rice] at sixteen.  So, I'm saying after that I wasn't, was, you know, I was, had run, in fact, I got pregnant so then I, at that's fuzzy.
Speaker 1: You became--
Speaker 2: But I know she did take me out the, in the, institution and like my foster mothers would say, "Your, when, when you get old enough your mother will take you out to work."  So I was very, I was very hostile and I was, and I wasn't very nice.
Speaker 1: Who was the, who was the, your boyfriend that you became--
Speaker 2: I didn't--
Speaker 1: --pregnant by?
Speaker 2: --oh, golly, if I can remember, Dodie Cisco [ph.].  And he was, he, Dodie Cisco.  And it was, I can't remember his, you know, what he, called him Dodie, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And your, so you--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --were fourteen or--
Speaker 2: Well, I must have been, I be, I was, I had my daughter when I was sixteen, so, it, but I, I, like I said, I was a runaway.  I, I used to run away.  I was very, I was very unhappy especially with the moves that was, that would, 'cause they would just decide they're gonna take you, or take you somewhere else.
Speaker 1: When you ran away where did you go?
Speaker 2: Oh, you g- I would go back to where I had been before.
Speaker 1: Meaning another foster home?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd go back to the foster home.  I, I think that's how that was.
Speaker 1: Did you ever li- have to sleep on the street?  Were you ever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --without a home?
Speaker 2: No, the only time I can remember sleeping on the street was here in New York [New York], (laughter).
Story_ID: 352112
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you get to New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: By running away, by running away.
Speaker 1: What time, what, do you remember the year it was when you ran away (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No year, no nothing.  I, I, to be exact.
Speaker 1: Well, what did you do once you arrived?  Did you have the baby [Joyce Rice] when you ran away to come to New York?
Speaker 2: Uh, oh, well, let me tell you what happened.  I, if I remember, if I can remember.  I found a domestic job, I was taking care of a lady's baby up on Convent Avenue but I was pregnant.  And then I met another individual and she let me stay at her house.  No, I was sleeping in a period of time and that's not too clear.  And I, after this person and I'm, had the privilege of meeting, she let me stay at her house on 8th Avenue [Frederick Douglass Boulevard], so I do remember that.  So, it's, you just, what, as a young person you just more or not play it by, you know, sort of play it by ear.  And you're, you're left out there to, it's real weird to have to find yourself in the street more or not but in those days I think it was quite different than today because people didn't use childre- young people for their own advantage.  Now I often say I'm sure if I'd have been coming along during that period I probably would have been a drug addict because I would probably always wanted to belong and that kind of a thing.  So that's, that's sort of, but I, I coming down that road of life I, I met some very good people and that's I think, that's what, you know, that I'm here today.  So--
Speaker 1: When you met the woman that you went to live with on 8th Avenue--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --do you remember her name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Now, did you stay with her until you gave birth to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --your daughter?
Speaker 2: No.  I, you know, that part of it is sort of, it's sort of completely, that period I, I just don't seem to sort of, and as you're speaking, now I'm, I'm just trying to think of who the people I was staying with, my, my daughter was--I remember, I was staying on 8th Avenue because that night we were, I was in the park and my pains started coming and I was rushed to Harlem [New York, New York], went to Harlem and Harlem sent me up to, I went, ended up in, oh, goodness I can't think of the hospital in the Bronx [New York], so she was born in the, in the Bronx, so.  It's--
Speaker 1: Now what is--
Speaker 2: --but it's a, it's kind of hazy for me.
Speaker 1: I see.  Were you allowed to keep her or did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, definitely.  Because the people on 8th Avenue, they--was very, I would say, as, as far as I can remember, they, they were very, very good to me so, during that, they were good.  And, and, and the wife was very good and I think when I left because the husband was, you know, stepping out of line.
Speaker 1: So did you have any contact with your daughter's father at this time?
Speaker 2: No, no.  His, his family lived on a 120th Street.  I remember he, he came, well, he came back and he, he came.  And he, we had, he had been together, he said the baby had to eat and what happened there he left me so the super [superintendent] could also, and the super he was a, a good person, and 'cause I was, I can remember that either I was crying but that's when I found myself without space to sleep and being on 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard], 7th, yeah, cause you had the Dewey Hotel [Dewey Square Hotel, New York, New York] there.  And I remember, you know, being in the street, yeah, (laughter) all night, you know, a couple of nights in the street.  But as I said before it wasn't like it is today.
Speaker 1: But did you have your daughter with you?
Speaker 2: Oh, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, you didn't have her at the time?
Speaker 2: No, I was, I was still, I was, I hadn't--
Speaker 1: Delivered.
Speaker 2: --I think, I might be ahead of my story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At that time, no.  So it was probably before what I just said before.
Story_ID: 352113
Speaker 1: So, you had your daughter, you were living with a family on 8th Avenue [Frederick Douglass Boulevard, New York, New York] and then you went to work as a domestic?
Speaker 2: No, I, I, no, that's before I went, went to work as a domestic.  I was pregnant when I was doing domestic work.
Speaker 1: What did you do after your daughter was born?
Speaker 2: What did I do?
Speaker 1: And let's get your daughter's date of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, in fact it'll be next month, July 9, 1936.
Speaker 1: So after you delivered your daughter on July 9, 1936, what did you do for a living and where, where did you live?
Speaker 2: What did I do as a living?  I, now I'm, as, as you're talking, you're making me think of things that I--
Speaker 1: Well, tell me everything you're thinking of (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I think what happened, I, I, I ended up as a, as a, a day worker, domestic worker for a quarter an hour, and I did, did housework.  And it was lot, there's, and I'd leave her, in fact, I often say, like now if you're leaving your child, you know, you'd go to jail.  But I used to leave her, I lived at 222 West 128th Street.  And I had a, I had made friends with a person, well-known musician and his wife and they had daughters.  And I would leave my daughter in, in the crib, in the crib and her children would come and look after my daughter 'til I got work.  So it seem like I learned to more or not maintain myself.  I'd moved and again I say, you don't think of these things until you start talking about 'em.  And, and then somehow or other, I moved from a 128th Street and I, right now, I can't, I'm thinking 'cause I, I, I am, I'm trying to really, I moved from a 128th Street, I can't remember where I went from a 128th Street.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, who was the well-known musician that you--
Speaker 2: His name was Cecil Scott.  His wife was Nina Scott.  Has, in fact, I saw one of his daughters here the other day, and they had Sarah [Sarah Scott], Punchie [ph.] Lorraine [Lorraine Scott], it was just a, heck, they were really good people, you know, that's what I say.  And--
Speaker 1: And what, what did you name your daughter?
Speaker 2: Oh, Joyce [Joyce Rice].  She was a joy.  And I, it was, it was, it was, well, having a baby, you know, it sort of changes your whole way of thinking.  And it was, she was, it, she was, well to have someone that depended on you, it's, it's so, and that looked to you, it sort of make you a completely different person.  And coming, sort of coming up--
Story_ID: 352114
Speaker 1: Now one time, I can't, I'm trying to go back, oh, okay, I'm getting, probably getting ahead of my story.
Speaker 2: That's, okay.  Let me hear what's on your (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Oh, I think that was in the '40s [1940s], in the '40s [1940s], that's when you had the war [World War II, WWII].  And I would, I always like to say they trained all of us in two weeks, so I learned how to use a micrometer and a blueprint and all that and I worked at Wrights Aeronautical [sic. Curtiss-Wright Corporation].  And I was able to, oh, well life really began 'cause you was making money.  And at that time, during that period you couldn't find anybody to take care of your, your child.  So I had to place her [Joyce Rice] in foster care, which I--
Speaker 2: What does that mean place her in foster care?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: What does that mean?  Was that the same type of foster care you were in?
Speaker 1: No, well, yeah, well it, they, they, she got placed in a family.  But during that period, during that period you couldn't find just ordinary people to take care of your child because everybody was working in the war plant, you know, so during, I believe that's how it, how it was.
Speaker 2: So with her, and when you were working with, at Wrights Aeronautical and she went into foster care did you see her again, were you able to see her on a regular basis (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, I, oh, yeah I saw my daughter regular, yeah, um-hm, yeah.  So it was, yeah, I did.  I wasn't gonna let her go, you know, and I placed her with the Sheltering Arms here in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Now did she stay overnight with this family, every night, I mean, they literally took care of her (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, because that was done by the city.
Speaker 2: So you gave her over to the city?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gave her over to the city.
Speaker 2: Now do you know why you did that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had to.
Speaker 2: --if you were making money at the time?
Speaker 1: We couldn't find nobody to take care, when you couldn't find nobody to take care of her and you just didn't wanna leave her here, there, and everywhere, yeah.
Speaker 2: So how often did you get to see her?
Speaker 1: Well, just regular.
Speaker 2: On the weekends or--
Speaker 1: No, it, it well, I, I'd see her, 'cause I went, was working five days a week and they, you, you did.  I, there was no problem with, with seeing my child.
Story_ID: 352115
Speaker 1: You know, just trying, I never kept records, so it's, it's all, this is just trying to go back on memory.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So we're starting with the--we're rolling with the tapes again.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, we, I just wanna go back to in the 1940s when you were working at Wrights Aeronautical [sic. Curtiss-Wright Corporation] your daughter [Joyce Rice], you gave her over to foster care.
Speaker 1: Foster care.
Speaker 2: And what happened after the war [World War II, WWII] ended?
Speaker 1: Well, after the war ended, I want, I wanted to get my daughter and then I ran into difficulty.  And, and--
Speaker 2: What difficulties did you run into?
Speaker 1: Well they didn't, gave me a very difficult time in trying to get her back.  And it was, it, it was, what did they do?  Well, they, they tell you, every time you, you went back so then there was always something that you didn't do.  It's not like they told you, you had to do this, this, and this but every time you'd come back.  So it was more or not to discourage you so that you would not take her.  I think I must have got her back about, when she was about twelve or thirteen, I think.
Speaker 2: How long had she been in care at that time?
Speaker 1: Well, it's hard to say.  I just, it was, you know, I think she went in the '30s [1930s].  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right 'cause she born in '36 [1936].
Speaker 1: Yeah, so she probably, about five, the exact time I, it's hard for me to be exact.  I know she was born in '36 [1936] and she probably went in at a, probably about, she might have been in there about, when she five or six, exactly, (background noise) I don't know, probably in talking with her, she could remember.  But I, its, just didn't talk about, just didn't talk that much about it.  It was like a, you know, a bad dream.  So the less I talk the better I always felt.  I do kind of remember the different places that I lived.  And--
Speaker 2: What, what was consistent in your life at that--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's a good (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) at this time?
Speaker 1: --what, what was, that's a good question.  Well, I think once I got my daughter and I, I was able to get my own, own, I got my own apartment, I was forced to get my apartment because I was living at 413 West 144th Street with a beautiful person, the Morgans [ph.] and the, this social worker said that I couldn't have, came, everything had been done, that I would not be able to have my daughter 'til I had her, her own bedroom.  And so I had to find an apartment and that's when I found 540 West 158th Street, 1943.  So I was able to live there and good people that I, and that's where she went to school in up, uptown.

Speaker 1: While you were a young adult in Harlem [New York, New York] at the time, were you able to enjoy any of Harlem's attributes, the night life were you able to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: I just never was a night person.  I, I, I just was not a night, night person at night time.
Speaker 1: Were you able to be a part of any of Harlem's political renaissance?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't, it's, I, it's, you, you got me in space there.
Speaker 1: Well, I'll just--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --ask you some specific things--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that were happening, tell you some specific things and you tell me if, you know, if they meant anything to you at the time.  I mean, it was, for example, when, you know, let's just go with Jackie Robinson.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, well that was very exciting time 'cause that's baseball, first black man and we, it was, it was very, felt very proud to see.  And it was being written up in that, he was, he was a real, oh, goodness, he, he was what you call a martyr, well we, we worshipped him 'cause there were, and certainly the role that he played because he wasn't like Stepin Fetchit, (laughter) you know, so, he was a real man, at least that's what I thought.
Speaker 1: So prior to him you mentioned Stepin Fetchit, did you have a feeling that black men were perceived--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --as Stepin Fetchit, types?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I would say that I would just, I, I, I know, I was one of them that would never go, go to those shows because it always had us, you know, degrading.  He, he was good, I don't, you know, but he was not someone that I wanted my daughter [Joyce Rice] to be seeing.
Speaker 1: So were you able to, like did you know any, were you, like entertainers like Lena Horne?
Speaker 2: Oh, we all went, oh, yes, very, very, Ethel Waters, you know.
Speaker 1: So where did you see them?  Where was the venue?
Speaker 2: Ethel Waters was at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] Lena Horne, I, was at the Apollo, Lena Horne you saw her in movies so it was good because then you would see, seeing another artist in a, in a whole 'nother role, so.
Speaker 1: So did you go to the Apollo often?
Speaker 2: I guess, I, I went just like everybody else (laughter).  You, you know, you it's according to what your pocketbook would do, would--had.
Story_ID: 352117
Speaker 1: So at the time you, when you were able to go to the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] and, and sort of have a little extra money to do, extra things with, do you remember sort of the stores you shopped in on 125th Street?  Can you create for me what the atmosphere was like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well during, you could shop at, I would, I would say I didn't too much shopping but it, but that was in the early days probably when blacks couldn't even purchase in the store.  If you purchase you couldn't put, put, put--
Speaker 1: Try it on.
Speaker 2: --try it on.  Blumstein [Blumstein's Department Store, New York, New York] was one of 'em at--
Speaker 1: And what was the name of that store?
Speaker 2: Blumstein.
Speaker 1: Where was Blumstein's located?
Speaker 2: 125th Street about the middle of the block, between 7th [7th Avenue; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] and--7th and 8th [8th Avenue; Frederick Douglass Boulevard].
Speaker 1: And you could buy the clothes but you couldn't try them on?
Speaker 2: You could, you could, you, you could buy it but you couldn't try 'em on.
Speaker 1: And that was here in Harlem [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it was that way?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.  Also you had the Alhambra [RKO Alhambra, New York, New York] that was here that you had upstairs and some of it I think by, you know, I, I've been told, told about the Alhambra.
Speaker 1: What was the Alhambra?
Speaker 2: Right here at, where we--
Speaker 1: It was a theater?
Speaker 2: --right across the street there, where they had the bowling, yeah, right there, that was the Alhambra.
Speaker 1: And it was a theater?
Speaker 2: It was a theater but blacks had to sit up stairs.
Speaker 1: So do you remember any magazines at the time, I mean, do you remember Life magazine and [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks doing--
Speaker 2: Life, well, Gordon Parks name was very familiar there at the, it was.  And, and there are names that I just at this time I don't, you know, somebody reminds me.
Story_ID: 352118
Speaker 1: Who made an impression on you at this time as far as political figures?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think you'd have to say, Adam [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], people like Ben Davis [Benjamin Jefferson Davis, Jr.].  It was, it was just great 'cause they were black men who stood up and that's what you were, you, you, you needed that kind of an idol.  I say they were, they were men who spoke out.  I'm trying to think of, Ben Davis, I think was a councilman and I think I'm correct.
Speaker 1: Benjamin Davis who, he, Benjamin Davis, Jr. was a councilman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And, and the, most of these people lived right here in Harlem [New York, New York], Ben, Ben lived a 126th Street and 5th Avenue, 5th and, in that house there on the corner.  So it, it, it was like a, a new era, you, we wasn't the Stepin Fetch [Stepin Fetchit]- you know, you had other, others to look at, so.
Speaker 1: So, Benjamin Davis was also one of, one of the eleven Communist leaders that was convicted in the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's what they called him a Communist but they, as far as I'm concerned he was, he was outspoken, speaking out for African American people.  Then the, the people said Negroes see (laughter).
Story_ID: 352119
Speaker 1: So, let's just move forward (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it's--
Speaker 1: --a little bit and after you left Wright Aeronautical [sic. Curtiss-Wright Corporation] because the war [World War II, WWII] had ended, what did you do for work?
Speaker 2: Oh, I found a, a, a, I went to the garment work as a, a friend of mine got me into the, the garment, the gar- you know, working on the machine and that's where I got involved with the union [International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union], um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what did you do at the garment industry working the machines (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I learned how to sew.  I learned how to sew zipper, zippers and that was a, what you'd call a zippist, I learned to be a zippist at a, I originally started, in those days your children wore their leggings and I would make leggings and you just learned how to, I learned how to sew.
Speaker 1: Were there any other black women working in the garment industry--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --district at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How many--
Speaker 2: But we--
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: --and it was a lot of discrimination which was going on.  We knew that the shops were for the white, these shops was meant for the white women and that they, you know, they made the funds or the money, they, they made the funds, they made it quite clear, racism was alive and well during them days.  But you didn't, you know, I was looking for work at that time and it, you know, you just was looking for work.  And those things never, but you knew that the, you know, there was a difference in the system and I think you, you began to learn that.
Speaker 1: So there were enough black women to organize?
Speaker 2: I don't know because everybody would come through the, the, the union and--
Speaker 1: How did you become a part of the union?
Speaker 2: Well, you had to, you know, you joined the union.  At that time, you know, I was making, well I, I came, I was, came up with the chairlady, I guess, my activities in the, in the union because of (unclear).  And I was, did become the chairlady which again if the white man spoke something to you, you know, you were supposed to obey him, you know.  And I probably began to, I didn't wanna obey anybody, you know, especially when I knew it was wrong.  And well again I will say it was more or not you knew it was discrimination, you were treated differently than the, than the whites and that made quite a difference.  They made more money than you, so you began to, you, I guess I became, and then you had other people talking to you and telling you, giving you, sort of older women talking to you so you're young, you're learning.  And it was a, it was, it, it, it was a, it was a, a learning, it was, it was really learning and I guess some of it helped me to sort of do the, do, you know, what I'm doing, I'd say best now.
Speaker 1: What was the exact name of the company you worked for in the garment industry?
Speaker 2: Oh, golly, oh wow, I did know.  I know one was Feldman, Feldman and I worked for Feldman company and I'm probably dropping a whole lot of things that I've really forgotten about but I worked for Feldman.  And I know we moved, and we started in New York [Manhattan, New York] and then I think we moved to, to oh, goodness out in, in Queens [New York].
Story_ID: 352120
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was your daughter [Joyce Rice] still in foster care at this time?
Speaker 1: No, my, at that time my daughter was, was home.
Speaker 2: And you were living--?
Speaker 1: I was living up on 58th Street, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now you met and married?
Speaker 1: I did (laughter).
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Well, that was my worst day.
Speaker 2: Well, let's talk about your husband a little bit.  How did--
Speaker 1: Oh, let's not talk about him.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well, just how did you meet him?
Speaker 1: Oh, he was a tailor.  And I always say he married two for one, wanted two for one, he married one but he get, he figured he'd have two 'cause my daughter was growing and developing.  And he'd gotten so he didn't want her doing this, that, and the other.  And I just got the, you be, well, you begin to, you, you know, it, well a parent always enjoys attention and I, I guess, whatever happened exactly.  But it became a, what was it, one night we were out, I think we were out, we were out with some friend, friends and when I came in, and he was a, what do you call it, a, you know, I guess, a woman's man, and he was messing with the woman and the gir- and the, what is it, on the ground floor.  And that night he came in and I might not be remembering it exactly, and he went to my neighbor's apartment and then I came, got up and I came in, I went to bed, and, and he, I have, I have to think what happened, I felt that if he didn't get what he was looking for wherever he went that that was, you know, that was it.  And he, we got in an argument, somehow got in an argument, and he stabbed me up and punctured my lung.  And, and I always remember the police saying, at that time they weren't like they are today, and I ended up in the hospital for I think about a month or something like that.  I always tell everybody I can remember when all my, I had people coming in to see me at ten o'clock in the morning, I knew I was booked to go.  And he, after then and I just didn't want no parts of him.  And he went to court and he was in jail and all that stuff.  And that was that, that was in 1950, I can remember that year.  And it was, it was, I'm just glad I'm here 'cause it, I think that probably changed my, I would say changed my whole life.  And what you do at that period, you realize how important life is and it's, you really do you realize how important life is and then what you as an individual what your contributions what are you do, what are you doing.  And I think that's, began to sort of and naturally I did, I didn't wanna see as far as a man, I didn't want no parts of that, that life anymore and I just started doing, being very active out here.  And the, getting involved, union, got involved with the union [International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union].  And sort of, so it's, the, the exact, a lot of stuff, you know, and I just don't remember.
Story_ID: 352121
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Irving [ph.], oh, God, Irving.  We got married, we were married but--
Speaker 1: How long were you married for?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Believe it, I think we got married in June and that happened in October, that happened in October so it wasn't a, a, a long, you know, period of time.  My daughter's [Joyce Rice] been married fifty-two years so it wasn't nothing like that (laughter).  It's a whole, it was a whole different thing that I encountered with him.  And then, you know, it might not have changed too much today but sometime men marry single women because you got an apartment and you got a place, so, you know, you, it's, you just, one day you sit back and you say why in the hell did I do that, you know (laughter).  It's, it's, I'm just glad that I've been able to, to accomplish many of things that I've, I've done.  And, and again I say with no pay, you know, most people it's, you know, can joke because they got paid but I, I, I've never been able to receive pay. And I'm sort of very independent.  I don't, I don't, I don't beg, I don't beg.
Story_ID: 352122
Speaker 1: What happened after you got out of the hospital?
Speaker 2: Oh, I just can't, well, I was, I guess I went back to, I had to work.
Speaker 1: But you went back to work also I, and you said you were you, you fel- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I worked in nonunion shops.  After that I was, I got involved with Adam Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, when did you, when did you become a part of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union?
Speaker 2: Oh, golly.  It was--
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Must have been in the, had to be in the '40s [1940s] to be exact.  I, I have a union book but all that stuff is in storage.  There's a lot of stuff if I'd a just had, you know, had a chance to get my hands on that stuff, I could have--
Speaker 1: How did Adam Clayton Powell contact you for, in 1960?
Speaker 2: He didn't, it was, it was, done through his office, his office (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, well, how did his office know to contact you?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened, well, I think, oh, God, I have something here that that tells you, it was through the, I think the, the black, like, the black union, I think that's how.  And they had a case, 'cause I was just reading it last night, and they had a case and at the bottom of that sort of tells you, my name comes up on that sheet of what happened.  So it's a, what should I say?
Speaker 1: Do you remember what he said in '62 [1962] at the congressional hearings?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter) well, I just let him know that, just, you know, discrimination and the difference in the union and, and what happened I think if I can remember, that black workers did not get the same work as white workers.  And that we were, naturally we weren't making the same income, couldn't make the same income.  And with that I, I just told him exactly how I felt and my business agent told me and I don't remember his name, I think it might have been Danny [ph.] somehow it might have been, but I, I, I don't wanna say for sure.  And they, God I lost my thought there but what did you say?
Speaker 1: Well, you were going to tell, tell me about what you testified to?
Speaker 2: Well, so when I testified that the unions discriminated and I had a couple of other people who, who sort of agreed with me, and what we had noticed the people coming, in other words, white workers would come in the shop and they'd get good jobs, and when I say good jobs, good was piecework.  And they, they always kept the blacks at a certain level.  So it's, that what, made you pay attention to what was, what was really going on.  And as a result of that I rebelled at it and I couldn't help it.  And when Adam's hear- you know, hearing was, I was too glad to participate, you know, which the business agent said, "If you testify you, you'll never work again."  And that's, that's in, in the book, in any of the book.  I'm in 'Black Women in White America' ['Black Women in White America: A Documentary History,' ed. Gerda Lerner], you'll, the book on that by Gerda Lerner, 'Racism in America' [sic. 'Race in America: The Struggle for Equality,' ed. Herbert Hill and James E. Jones, Jr.], I don't know if you've seen any of those books by Herb Hill [Herbert Hill].  And Herb was a great guy, he's passed.  He stuck, and he was Jewish and was a, he, he really went against this, the, against the folks.
Story_ID: 352123
Speaker 1: And I just stood for what I believed and I just never, and then to, to punish me I never worked another day in a union shop, you know.  And I always like to say I think unions, you know, I, I, that union treated me bad but see I say that the unions have never been for black people, you know, they were, they, you became a member but you never received the benefits like the, the whites and I guess that's, I always showed, you know, showed that.  And as a result I did work in a couple of union shops until, I think then what you had, you had your poverty problem program come along and then there were things that I had, I began to, you know, move into that direction.
Speaker 2: So talk to me about moving from, you, you said you were blackballed so you couldn't get any work?
Speaker 1: Couldn't get no garment work (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Union, no garment work.
Speaker 1: Um-um.
Speaker 2: And what was the poverty program that you spoke about?
Speaker 1: Now, when I say the poverty well, at that time, oh, well, see what happened from the, from the union there was a District 65, and he had a, I can't, and that's terrible 'cause I'd like to give honors to him and he just, he, we were talking and so he told me that he could get me work and he got me work in, where are we, here. At met, right across the street in Mentor Bentley [ph.].  And, and I got a job at Mentor Bentley in the credit house.  And that's when I began to see how we were being charged high- you know, higher prices.  And Mornat [ph.], and I had an Irish guy who taught me about, Mornat told me about credit 'cause the main idea was to keep people buying and buying which that's the, the, the, I call it the economy and that's the capitalistic system.  And that they had the door to door salesmen that was the dollar down, dollar, dollar down, dollar a month, what is it, dollar down, and the dollar a week.  I, I might not have that right but anyway you paid a dollar down, you paid for it for the rest of your life.  And I was able to, to begin to educate and tell people, you know, how they were being overpriced and like that, so.
Story_ID: 351654
Speaker 1: I think one of the things that had helped me out was attending hearings and that's where you meet all the, the big boys, the CEOs because they come to the hearings.  And I, I've met, well, generally in the utilities they all know me, well they know my name, you know.  And--
Speaker 2: How do you see yourself? Do you see yourself as an activist for the poor?  Do you see yourself--
Speaker 1: I like to, I'm always concerned with them, I'm not concerned with the well-to-do, I'm concerned with the people who don't know, I want the people like I never knew, you know.  And I found that people were not always willing to share, and especially the African Americans.  They're, we, we had sort of blocked oursel- selves, that they had their sororities and their membership and, and it appeared to me they, they never reached back, you know.  And what I always like to tell people, the doors were never opened to me by my people, they were always opened by, by the other, the whites.  And they, I, I find that generally when they meet people like myself and, you know, you, they hear your ideas and your thoughts, they work with it.  And on, on account of that and I've had a great life.  I've been able to travel.  And I've been able to go places that most people, and associate with people because I always like to say there's not--I will--it's spent, when I say spent time in Washington [D.C.] but I'd be in Washington practically all the time and you, you met all the, all the people, you know, the, the people that you need to know (laughter) which is, is good when you, when you, and especially when we were certainly trying to put through bills and stuff like that. For me I just say it's been a, my, my work has been a, a, a great work because out of it, I was able through a woman called Mattie Cook who was, what is it, here at, president, and I don't wanna mislabel like the president at Malcom-King College [Malcolm-King: Harlem College Extension, New York, New York], this Mattie Cook who gave me the opportunity to teach consumer education.  And I think I taught for about almost eight years, eight, between eight and ten years.
Speaker 2: Where did you teach?
Speaker 1: Malcom-King College, right over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Malcolm-King College, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, well, it was through, through Mattie otherwise I would probably, wouldn't even be talking.
Speaker 2: Mattie Cook?
Speaker 1: Mattie Cook, Mattie Cook, Malcolm-King president, I'll say president of Malcolm-King College.  And I was able to, what I learnt from the, I, the people that I associated with, I was able to bring a lot of the heads of the agency, the head of the agency into Harlem [New York, New York].  I was able to teach so many people out there consumer education, how to handle a telephone bill, their Con Ed [Consolidated Edison, Inc., New York, New York] bill.  It would always amaze me, you had doctors and lawyers and, you know, blacks who didn't know how to take care of their own bills, (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 351655
Speaker 1: So it was really, to me it was a, a great delight to be able to share what I had learnt.  And well I, it's always been, I don't wanna be the only one to know it, I just wanted to, to share.  And I think that's the most important thing being able to do consumer education.  This, just to say, this, we wouldn't be here in this building if I had not made them, you know, reopen it and--
Speaker 2: Well, let's, let's talk about that specifically and then we will go back in time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What, what happened for you to get this Verizon building open to the community as a technological center [Bell Atlantic Technology Center; Verizon Technology Center, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Oh, well we, it wasn't open, it was just, we just reopened it.  What happened, they were here and I always like to say about the union and the union never supported the workers here in Harlem [New York, New York] at that period.  And they closed this building and then they moved across the street.  And then they were gonna move from across the street down to 13th Street and I said, "No way."  I said "Number one, seniors they have to have some place that they can come."  And it was just the idea letting them know they, they just couldn't do--then there was a real, been a battle in, in their, their, what should I say?  At their, well, I was into all the hearings of the telephone company, new, it was New York Telephone [New York Telephone Company; Verizon Communications, Inc.], then it became Bell Atlantic [Bell Atlantic Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.], so I was at all those hearings in which we were able (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What year did the Verizon, what year did this building reopen?
Speaker 1: Don't ask, I, I--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was--
Speaker 1: --it's in the records.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's in the records.
Speaker 2: But it was recently that it was reopened--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --as a technical--
Speaker 1: It hasn't, this--
Speaker 2: As the center that it is--
Speaker 1: The center opened up in 1995.
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-five [1995].
Speaker 1: That, that I can remember and I think June, I, I'm almost sure in '95 [1995], '96 [1996] maybe I should say it that way.
Story_ID: 351656
Speaker 1: But let's go back in time a little bit because you, when you were working at the garment, in the garment industry you met Florynce Kennedy?
Speaker 2: Well I, I, I might have met Florynce Kennedy, I, I, I would say, I would say yes, I, I--
Speaker 1: What effect did she have on you?
Speaker 2: What effect?
Speaker 1: What did she teach you? I read that you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, what--
Speaker 1: --she was a feminist and you became one of her students.
Speaker 2: Well I, Flo, what effect she had on me, well we, we, how did it, I don't know how it happened but I guess, it must have come out of Flo.  And what, we had done a survey, we knew that black people had to pay for installation, and I have that so you can, I have a copy of that so you can see, and so they made us pay for installation.
Speaker 1: Let's stop for just a second--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --until the vibrations stop.  Okay.  Continue with they made you pay for installation.
Speaker 2: So what they, so I did a survey and Flo did this down, down, down, downtown and the whites were not paying installation.  So with that I just, that's when I, began going to the hearings and we, we, we went out, it was very, very interesting.
Speaker 1: But let me just make sense of this.  So you--
Speaker 2: That I made.
Speaker 1: And that that is one of the effects, one, one of the things Florynce taught you is how to do these surveys?
Speaker 2: No, no, Flo taught me how, that I did not have to, she gave me support all the way, that's all, support all the way, even when I wanted to stop and not do, do it, Flo, you know, you, you couldn't go back and face her 'cause she wanted to know, you know, so you couldn't go back and face her so you did what, what, and that's what we did, we--
Speaker 1: So the phone company at the time which was Bell Atlantic [sic. New York Telephone Company; Verizon Communications, Inc.]--
Speaker 2: It might have been Bell [Bell Atlantic Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.], it, it might have been New York Telephone.
Speaker 1: New York Telephone.  But they were charging--
Speaker 2: Originally back in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Back in the '60s [1960s] they were charging black customers an installation fee (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were in an installation, yeah.
Speaker 1: And not white customers?
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: And that--
Speaker 2: --the whites were not.  And s- yet I've had some blacks say well I didn't pay any.
Speaker 1: When that came to your attention what did you do about it?
Speaker 2: Well we, that's when we would go into the hearings and we--
Speaker 1: Where were the hearings held?
Speaker 2: Oh, that first was at 199--is it Church Street [New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: How do hearings like that come about?
Speaker 2: They're in the papers and they're in the paper--
Speaker 1: I know but who brings it about to say, to even get a hearing to say that the phone company is charging black people installation and not white people, who is in charge of bringing that movement to a hearing?
Speaker 2: Oh, now, that's a good question. That's a good question (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, how did you find out it was going to be a hearing?
Speaker 2: Oh, well through Flo.
Speaker 1: Through Flo.
Speaker 2: It was through Flo.
Speaker 1: How did Flo find out?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) that was through Flo Kennedy, you know, so I would, I would go to the hearings and--
Story_ID: 351657
Speaker 1: How was the, the Harlem Consumer Education Council founded?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it was '67, [1967], '68 [1968], '67 [1967] or '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: And that was your brainchild?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, we wanted to do a, I, I, I just like what I was, I guess, by going to the hearings and, and then I had, there's a little history that I've probably left out.
Speaker 1: What's the history?
Speaker 2: Well, the history that I formerly worked for a great guy, Marshall England, worked for him up in the Bronx [New York] and then I had been doing it up there on Washington Avenue.  And then you begin to learn that it's good to have an organization and came through with the organization.  And with that we formed the Harlem Consumer Education Council.  And then the other thing I did, I did the, also 'The Poor Pay More' ['The Poor Pay More: Consumer Practices of Low-income Families,' David Caplovitz] with a guy, a person, David Caplovitz--
Speaker 1: The poor pays more?
Speaker 2: 'The Poor Pay More.'
Speaker 1: Pay more.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a classic.
Speaker 1: And, and that was an article publisher?
Speaker 2: That, oh, that was a film--
Speaker 1: A film, okay.
Speaker 2: --on PBS [Public Broadcasting Service].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Mort, Mort Silverstein [Morton Silverstein] did that.  Mort, Mort is, he's still, we, I still talk to Mort.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But do you know what year that film was shown--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --thereabouts?  Okay.
Speaker 2: --but there's a matter of record.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you about the Harlem Consumer Education Council, you said '67 [1967] or '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you know if you formed it, '68 [1968] is when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, do you know if you formed it before that or after that?  Just so that I'll get the dates correct?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, I did, I can't.
Speaker 1: He was assassinated in April 4, I think 1968?
Speaker 2: I think, I think it was '67 [1967], I think it might have been '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the, what, what did you consider to be the purpose of the Harlem Consumer Education Council?
Speaker 2: To educate, to educate black people of how important to know about, about the money that they were spending and what they were spending it on.  And see what happens, the story, the story that I've been told, been handed down, when they set up schools for us during slavery, it was only to take care of the master and that meant it was wash and cook and sewing and ironing, that's the schools they set up.  The men, for the men it was farming and so agriculture as they say.  So my whole thing, economics and finance and money was never a part of that education.  So my whole thing, recognizing I'm in the black community, money was always the last thing that every, you know, you, you have when you sit down and you talk and you lay out plans, and no one say well where is the money coming or how are we gonna fund it and stuff like that.  So I found that in our, in our meetings we just never talk about finance and money and so I think that's sort in recognizing how, you know, with slavery and how far back we were, that it was all dealt with economics.  And I still say economics and finance and that's what I encourage, you know, business, you know, you just don't go looking for a job, you look to see how you can set up business.  And then I look at how we, those places we did set up like you had Oklahoma when they found that oil was on the land, and they just wiped that, those blacks out.  From Florida when the, so when the, once I began to, you know, sort of get a light of what has happened to destroy us because we're not, the, the black race is not like, and that was done to what is it?  Intimidate and frighten, the Ku Klux Klan [KKK], if you read the history of them, the work that they did.  So my whole thing was, let it be economics and finance.  And that's what I do, I, you know, I, I like to always say, look I have a granddaughter and she's, she's just great because some of my teaching has to learn how to be self-sustaining.
Story_ID: 351658
Speaker 1: How did you meet Mattie Cook?
Speaker 2: Oh, well Mattie had a college [Malcolm-King: Harlem College Extension] here in Harlem [New York, New York].  Well, Mattie she had a college in, in Harlem.  We started out it, on a 128th Street and I forget, I, I think the school was 201, I might be wrong.  And I just, it was, it was just great that she allowed me, 'cause see I don't have no degrees, and she allowed me with my, I always say eighth grade education to teach.  And I brought in the very best, I had the very best of people because by people being in the, in the consumer field, you know them, you just pick up the phone and call them.
Speaker 1: Now during the teachings, you taught consumer education (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Consumer education.
Speaker 1: Education.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you talk about economic racism?
Speaker 2: We did, we did not.
Speaker 1: Well, I'll ask you now.  What is economic racism?
Speaker 2: Economic racism is like, I have a very good friend right now at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] who was at Columbia, that brought into, to Columbia the, I think it's the law school housing, we did, well she was just great 'cause we had these meetings and, you know, my problem, and she brought them in.  And as a result of it, she's lost her job, yes, she's lost her job, she--
Speaker 1: Well, well, let's just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let me go ahead now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Not only has she lost her job which is her way of, her, her social security, her unemployment that has been eliminated, they, they, she, as of yesterday, she's, so what it is, is when they take away your source of income 'cause this all deals with economics.
Speaker 1: I wanna go back with this specific story that you're talking about and she helped you with your apartment situation that you're currently in?
Speaker 2: No, she had meetings--
Speaker 1: Meetings about?
Speaker 2: --at Columbia on housing and brought people in to talk and things like that, so.
Speaker 1: Now, the meetings were about discrimination--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in the housing market.
Speaker 2: No, it was because when you talk about housing today, it's affecting all the, all people.  If you, if, if, the middle class people are being shot to death, (laughter) you know, with high rents.  So, then, then, then when I started out, yeah, probably when I started out I, in, and what I try to do, I know like I tell people, I said when you get involved with what I'm involved with, I said it deals with economics and finance what you might find yourself without a job, you know, because if you stand up to talk about this you're gonna find yourself, you, you, you, you're not gonna be there.  So I always like to tell people when you talk, and when you're talking, whatever you're going, if you wanna change, be very careful how you do it.
Speaker 1: Well, what reasons did Columbia give her for letting her--
Speaker 2: Oh, they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) go?
Speaker 2: --they gave her some, some, excuse me, some asinine stuff that they, they told her.  But they, when they wanna get rid of you they always find ways to get rid of you.  So but what they've done to her, we're just waiting for her to, when she say that she needs help or we've, I've already told her she didn't have to worry about me, I'd be there and do whatever has to be done.
Story_ID: 351659
Speaker 1: So when you think about Harlem [New York, New York] as a community and, and think about educating the community, the community of consumers, what is the biggest task and, and, and--
Speaker 2: Of getting people to come to meetings (laughter).  Getting, getting people to come to a session.  I, I just, and I think, when generally I've always said I had more white people come to my workshops than I do have blacks.  Because when you talk about consumer education, it's, it's not something that that blacks think is, is, is of interest to them let me say that.  And with the topics that I've, you know, sort of have, 'cause one of the things that I've done over the years, educating about telephone company, Con Ed [Consolidated Edison, Inc., New York, New York], insurance, in fact, we were able to, the first what was is it, is it first twenty-five thousand, fifty thousand dollar insurance was done, you know, through, was done through, through my work.
Story_ID: 351660
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the, the years, sort of the 1970s, we've talked about the '60s [1960s] and you started the Harlem Consumer Education Council.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In the 1970s is when you were teaching.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '70s [1970s] and '80 [1980], um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did that change your life, I mean, you--
Speaker 2: It didn't, didn't change it.  I, I was always an activist so it didn't, I, it did, it made me fit, made me, I would say made me recognize that the only way that people would, of, of color would get this information, if, if only way they'd get it, if I did it, and we're, we're still battling 'cause we're trying to get it in schools which we have not been able to get in schools 'cause I think, what I call it, the skills of life just knowing how to function, how to buy a, if you're gonna buy a house, how to buy, the skills.  I always like to tell people, when people come to sell you something, they use all their skills and you go in what they say, you know, you don't, you don't know nothing about it, you have to take their word.  Always when you go into something, you know just as much as he know and, you know, that way to ask the right questions (laughter).  That's very, very important.  So that's it.
Story_ID: 351661
Speaker 1: So when you think about unions today and union leaders like Toussaint [Roger Toussaint]--
Speaker 2: Oh, I like, I, I wrote, I sent him a message or something that I, Toussaint, you know, what upsetted the white folks was he stood up to 'em, whether it was right or wrong I just loved him.  I, I, I just loved, just the fact that here was a black man 'cause I, I criticize black men all the time 'cause they don't stand up to white men and I, I like the fact that he did.  And then, I, I, I also make excuse for black men 'cause black women say to black men with the family, we don't give a damn what's happening out there you got these what do they call money, these crumb, crumb crushers, I'm trying to--crunchers--and you have to bring that money home so therefore, whatever is going on out there remember you have to work.
Speaker 1: Suck it up and take care of your family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so, yeah, so whatever happens you, you, you do anything but these crumb crushers have to be fed.  So men are different, where a woman, you know, would, it's not that, she's still, she always did.
Story_ID: 351662
Speaker 1: Do you see yourself as a pillar in the, in the Harlem [New York, New York] community?
Speaker 2: Hm, no, I'm just another person.  I don't wanna be, I'm just another person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, just another pers- well who are the other people, just other people that you feel make a difference in the community?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a woman called Miss Hilton [ph.].
Speaker 1: And if you can just tell me what they do in your opinion that makes a difference?
Speaker 2: What makes a difference in my opinion, the fact that she takes, saves a hundred dollars every month to take children between I think six and twelve to Georgetown, South Carolina, so they will know the history of, of the South, with, and I'm a part of the Gullah Festival [Original Gullah Festival] which I just did come, I was there in May, and to let them know about slavery and what happens 'cause you have some very, South Carolina was your biggest, one, one of, let me put it that way, one of the biggest states for slavery.  So it's just educating young--so black kids will have that pride, that they, you know, that they've been there, they know the history, and they'll feel because we feel that we've lost so many black kids 'cause they're not, they're not proud to be who they are.
Speaker 1: Who else in the community that you feel is doing something that--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, there's a woman called Beverly Grisby and I think that she does a heck of a lot 'cause here she, out of, she, she gets no, what is it, no grants, no nothing, but she runs preschool, preschool for the kids.  I think they're, three or four years, three or four years old, so people like her because that's, there's no pay, here's another woman, there's no pay, they're not getting no grants, they're not getting, getting anything it's just out of they're, they're, they're sacrificing, you know, so, I, I admire those.  There's other people but they're getting paid, you know, so those getting paid, you know, I can't, those who's not getting paid and doing it out of their pocket, and I do mine out of my pocket, the little that I have but, you know.  So it's not, it's not, and there are probably other people, there's a, like I say, Rose Peck [ph.] was working but she was doing things for the benefit of the community and that period of time, you know.  You, you, there's, there's a whole lot of people doing a whole lot of things, you just don't know, you got like, you gotta a guy called Sam White (laughter) you know.  Oh, don't, don't ask me because they will (unclear) my brains will begin to pick 'em up but he, you know, he--
Speaker 1: Who is Sam White?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, he's, he's a pillar of the community.  He's, he's, oh, goodness, Sam is, he's a great guy.  He's been an activist as far I've, you know, as I've known, so.  But I admire, I admire these people 'cause you can't help but.
Speaker 1: Well, you've been in Harlem long enough to see big changes happen.  You have--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: --Starbucks down the street.
Speaker 2: Oh, God, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: You have a T.J. Maxx, you have the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York] downstairs.
Speaker 2: Well, the Studio Museum, I happen to know the people who started that that's years, years ago.  And I know the, I forget their names, but they're, they, they I never hear their names even mentioned now but it was, you know, those are the people that I know.
Story_ID: 351613
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So I'm just gonna start where we left off and then we're work our way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --back up to that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you were talking about Harlem [New York, New York] and just the changes you've seen in Harlem.  But can- you were mentioning the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem] in Harlem.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But can you, how do you feel about the, the new, the new businesses that are coming as far the, or how are they treating, working with the black community, are they--
Speaker 2: They're not is the way I feel. That, that they're not.  First thing they're the big companies, they're, they're the big companies.  See years ago, you had a little small business man.  And everybody, you know, would, when something came up, they, they would, contribute to the organization.  Today I don't see, see that.  So the big, big companies don't contribute to, to, that I see, to, to the grassroot like if I gave something, a storekeeper would put an ad in the paper or something like that, I don't see that.  'Cause I do know Verizon [Verizon Communications, Inc.] and Con Edison [Consolidated Edison, Inc., New York, New York], they do, they, they participate and they're like they used to be.  These new companies, and then mostly they're owned by a lot, I'll say foreigners that some of them, many of them don't even hire, hire African Americans.  So it's, so that, that sort of concerns me.  That's a, that in today's day and time.  And our black men are, 51 percent out of work.  And in morning time when you look in the, in the, in the morning I see it's a whole white community and that's the trucks and the big business, big companies, construction company and nobody is saying anything about that.
Speaker 1: So the workers that are coming to build in Harlem you feel are mainly white?
Speaker 2: Well, in--
Speaker 1: In--
Speaker 2: --in the construction, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the construction, yes, okay.
Speaker 2: Construct, they're the one--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --driving the trucks and they're the ones that (unclear) got the top jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So all they got somebody out there doing the flagging, then they bring, right now, bring in a lot of immigrants 'cause they don't, and I don't have anything against the immigrants but the fact that black men in our community don't have work and nobody seems to give a damn.  And Bush [President George Walker Bush] I understand is cutting all, all the budgets and you're on your own attitude.  So I'm, I'm, I, I don't know where, what, what, what it'll mean for African Americans and I'm not talking about the, the, for Africans who come here 'cause they too don't have no respect for African Americans and that's, that's what they, they, if it wasn't for us they wouldn't be here.
Speaker 1: Well, what are your hopes for the African American community in Harlem--
Speaker 2: Well, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and throughout the country?
Speaker 2: --well, for number one, racism, people, what I like about, what I see now, people are more and more talking about what racism really is.  And it's institutionalized, nothing better than Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] up there, there's racism is, is as long as there's racism in this country, nothing is gonna change.  And they would rather hire a black person who, who might not, just to say they have a black on.  So I'm, I'm, I'm, that, that concerns me a lot and I'll, I'll always feel the same 'til I know that we can, racism eliminated and I'll never see it.
Story_ID: 351614
Speaker 1: Well, when you look back over the struggles and the fights that you've been a part of, which ones are you most proud of?
Speaker 2: I would say the, well, I'm most proud of well, I'd like to say the, really when you think about it direct deposit 'cause that has helped a lot of people throughout who'll never know of Florence Rice [HistoryMaker Florence M. Rice].  That will help, and anybody who don't want their, you know, can have their check mailed, mailed to 'em, so that that, I, makes me feel good 'cause people are doing things they don't know, even know how it came about.
Speaker 1: How did the, the direct deposit come about?  What was, what was it?
Speaker 2: It was a hearing.
Speaker 1: What was the under- I mean, who was being, why did it come about?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the fact, well, you know, we're in a, a technology world and the banks naturally they found a way that makes it easier for them.  And it was convenience for the, for the banks that's the way I look at it.
Speaker 1: What effect was it having on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then the fact you got the banks and the government and everybody, now lots of even, jobs, companies do, you know, send checks to the banks, so.
Speaker 1: Now was that, did you feel that that was a bad thing for African Americans or a good thing?  I mean, why was there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For me, yes, because--
Speaker 1: Because--
Speaker 2: --yes, it's bad because if I can't borrow no money when I'm talking about I got a business, I'm, I wanna be able to be just like everybody else and I can't get, get, borrow the money like a white person, yes, and my, my whole thing is I could not see first thing giving your money to the bank, which is the same bank you couldn't borrow a dime from.  So this, this is just, and I, you know, I don't see, there's still no change.  Blacks could not, so that's all it, I, I, like they tell you they gave, you could get houses but you get the house but you couldn't get a loan, so come on, you know.
Speaker 1: What were the hearings on direct deposit?  I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm just trying to get it clear.  You--
Speaker 2: Well, that wasn't--
Speaker 1: --you were in the hearings on direct deposit (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that was hearings, one was held, held down at the Custom House [Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And the hearings were to stop--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, what were they--
Speaker 2: Well, they just had people come in and like they do in, in any of the other agencies, you come in and, you know, you give opinion or you, you can write in or be there testify.
Speaker 1: And then the, the general consensus on direct deposit, on direct deposit from African Americans' standpoint was that--
Speaker 2: My standpoint.
Speaker 1: From your standpoint was that--
Speaker 2: From my standpoint.
Speaker 1: --was that the, you were giving your money to a bank that wouldn't give you a loan?
Speaker 2: You couldn't, you couldn't get a loan.  You could not get a--we, many of us wouldn't be in the position that we're in if we could have been like the whites who went and borrowed or racism in which you were able and held your job, or like I said you spoke out, you didn't have no job, what did they do to me, they cut me off.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So at the hearings you spoke out against direct deposit?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what effect, what did you see, what did that do after you spoke out what did it change?
Speaker 2: Well, it, when it came back is that you, if you want to you can, and I really wasn't against, that much against direct deposit because you, what happens a lot of bank- a lot of mailboxes was being broken into.  So it, it wasn't, it wasn't bad, I'm just saying don't force me to put my money in, in a bank, that's all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let me decide what I wanna do and that's what they were telling black folk, you, and then take my money and then loan it to somebody else, Upstate New York or wherever.
Speaker 1: What were the biggest loans black people were being given at the time?
Speaker 2: I don't, I really don't know.  But I do know that they could not and what I do know I, I, I have a relative that not here, in, in Florida and he couldn't get a loan to open up his business.  Now, they're begging him to, to make, make a loan.  And what was so interesting, a friend of mine on the, in the consumer movement he sent me the article of the, of, of when they wrote up the story about it because he could not get a loan and that's one of your biggest restaurants in fort, fort, Fort Lauderdale [Florida], I think Jenkins [Tom Jenkins Barbeque] or something.  So don't, when you start telling people (laughter) no, I'm, I'm, I'm very, very concerned.
Speaker 1: So what are the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And nothing has changed.
Story_ID: 351615
Speaker 1: You said that was an accomplishment, the direct deposit.  What were the other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As far as I'm concerned.
Speaker 1: As far as you're concerned what are the other things that you're proud of that you've done?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm proud that this building is here, I'm proud this technology, Verizon Technology education center [Bell Atlantic Technology Center; Verizon Technology Center, New York, New York] is here where people can come and learn about the web and they have three, four good people up here that is just, just makes it a excellent place to come learn, for free (laughter) so that's what I, I say that I like about what I've done.  And I think what I've done also is inspired a lot of other people that regardless of how you start it's up to you, what you do with your life, you can make it good or you can make it bad.  And one thing I can, oh, I like to say that as far as alcohol and drugs is something that I never touched.  That's, well I did one time, I went out with a g- Joyce's [Joyce Rice] father, and I got high and then I got pregnant and that's when I began to learn what alcohol was and that was my lesson for life (laughter).
Speaker 1: So when were you named Woman of the Year?
Speaker 2: In 1999 for the consumer week.  And I have something here I can show you that, so (laughter).  And generally anything I say is a matter of record.
Speaker 1: Of course.  And it's great to get a firsthand account of how it all happened from you directly.
Speaker 2: It's, it's just keep continue doing it, you know, because I, I think it's important, you know, even at my age now, you, it's, it's good to, to know that you can change things.  And I think the greatest thing of all here in, even though with the, my criticism on, on racism, you still can, you, you can still achieve and you can change people's lives and I think we have to at least let young people know it's up to them.
Speaker 1: So along those same lines I'd like to question you on about, on, on things like what would you like to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Consumer education, educating poor people.
Speaker 1: What legacy do you wanna leave behind?
Speaker 2: Well, if it was possible, I would like to set up an international institute just to teach consumer education, that's, really what I'd really hope one day my dreams will come true.
Story_ID: 351616
Speaker 1: And then, if you had to sort of the, the mission or the, the tag line of consumer education what would, or the definition I should say, of consumer education as you see it would be?
Speaker 2: Well, consumer education, teaching people the skills of life of what everyday life, what, what you come in contact.  And there's a person that I didn't me-, didn't speak about.  I have a mentor, Lugenia Gordon, Republican, and she's been quite an inspiration in my life.  We, in fact, if you wanna know what I did, I went to London [England] and gave the Wilberforce family, yeah, I know you've heard of Wilberforce college [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], and we gave them the honor, honor roll, a abolitionist honor roll in, in London, and I had the privilege of presenting it and I can share with you that presentation 'cause I have it here with me.
Speaker 1: What was your mentor's name again?
Speaker 2: Lugenia Gordon.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that first name?
Speaker 2: L-U-G-E-N-I-A.
Speaker 1: Lugenia.
Speaker 2: Lugenia Gordon.
Speaker 1: Gordon.
Speaker 2: And, in fact, I'm going up there next week to see her.  And she's, now she, you, you, you asked for someone, she is someone gotta, not only that she's got a history behind her.  She's really got a history.
Speaker 1: Well, how has she helped you as a mentor, what sorts of things has she done for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, encouraging me, encouraging me 'cause you always need encouragement.  And if you decide you're gonna do something, to do it.  I think my, I would say my Gullah experience is also through her and that's a whole 'nother story.
Story_ID: 351617
Speaker 1: I don't know if you've heard about the Gullah, Beaufort in South Carolina that you gotta (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, ma'am, I have, but go ahead tell me.
Speaker 1: There's a terrific woman down there, Rosalie Pasant [sic. Rosalie F. Pazant] and she's a, she is someone that should be known.  And--
Speaker 2: And that organization is go, tell me about it?
Speaker 1: Well, it's the, it's the, the Gullah Festival [Original Gullah Festival], it's done every year just before Decoration Day [Memorial Day].  And it's been going on now twenty, we just celebrated twenty years.  And it's down in Beaufort.
Speaker 2: Beaufort.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And that's a very historic place, as far as, as slaves and the stories that's be, you know.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And, in fact, your first representative to Washington [D.C.] I believe came from Beaufort.
Speaker 2: And Beaufort is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Small [Robert Smalls] is his name.
Speaker 2: --I think recognized as one of the first African American towns--ships, I think, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: No, I know what you're told, you're talking about, oh, goodness, Amistad [La Amistad], the Amistad?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not--
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was looking--
Speaker 1: --I don't, I don't have the whole history but I know--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --there's a Amistad, -stad.
Story_ID: 351618
Speaker 1: Just sort of in conclusion--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what, what things are you still working on today?
Speaker 2: Ooh, what am I working on today?
Speaker 1: Well, you're, you're fighting your landlord so that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, well--
Speaker 1: --yeah, the landlord tenant.
Speaker 2: --I'm, I'm homeless (laughter) I'm homeless.  I never, you know, I just never think of that.  I'm here fighting the land- well, we're, I, I gotta win this battle.  And then the purpose of it was the fact that I found too many seniors giving up and surrendering and I just couldn't see that.
Speaker 1: And this is the same apartment you had to have--
Speaker 2: In '43 [1943] when I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in '43 [1943] to get your daughter [Joyce Rice].
Speaker 2: --for my daughter.
Speaker 1: Now what happened with the landlord, he wanted the apartment back or he wanted you to go--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, now, right now they're--wanna evict all us old folks, they say it's time for you to die and we want these apartments and I, and that's, that's really what they're, they're doing.  I understand 1700, I don't, and this is hearsay, 1700 seniors in Washington Heights [New York, New York] been thrown out their apartment through and then you must remember the real estate people have bought up everything so they, they're, they're really governing the country, real estate people throughout the country and with something that I have now throughout the world.  So because everything now is privatized, so there it is.
Speaker 1: Now was it a rent stabilized building?
Speaker 2: Rent stabilized, rent stabilized and rent controlled.
Speaker 1: Rent controlled.  So he, they were able to physically get you out of the apartment then, how did they do that?
Speaker 2: Well, they did what you call constructive eviction.  And what they do, HPD [New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development] comes in and they're supposed to, they give you these violations, if, and then the stipulation, three, three rooms and they come in and they bring in their, their people, their unlicensed contractors, and they just totally destroyed the apartment, the only thing they left me in the apartment was a, a toilet.  They had completely destroyed the apartment.  But they do that to older people.
Speaker 1: Forcing you to have to leave?
Speaker 2: They force us, and then, and even the lawyers, the landlord's lawyer came and even put a padlock on the door so I couldn't get in.  When you're old they can do any damn thing to you.  They took, I always tell 'em, they talked about Hitler [Adolf Hitler], we got Hitlers right here.  And but I must say there are some good landlords, you know, but on a whole it's a business and--
Speaker 1: So you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) there's a whole changing of the, of, of the city.  I'm just afraid that this whole thing is gonna blow up because you don't have enough people to supply all these buildings that they're building and if you run all the middle class and poor people out, what do you have (laughter)?
Speaker 1: So you will continue to fight (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Got to.
Speaker 1: --for consumer rights and--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: --and tenant rights?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 351619
Speaker 1: What other things will you continue to fight for?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I just wanna edu-, just make people aware of their rights, 'cause you have a, when you have people better aware of their rights, then they, they don't get, they don't get caught up in these mortgage things, these shams and they don't, it's just the innocent shopper who gets caught up.  And it's just again, I say consumer education is skills, knowing how to shop, knowing where to go.
Speaker 1: Well, did you think you'd come this far only with an eighth grade education?  Do you ever think about how far you've come?
Speaker 2: No.  Because truthfully I took a lot of cou-, what you say sessions.  I went to, what's it, the Henry George School [Henry George School of Social Science, New York, New York].  I went up to in the Bronx [New York], I forget the school, I, when, when you say that the Mo-, I went, makes me think about the Monroe Business School [Monroe College School of Business and Accounting, New York, New York] and how I went through there, how I went to George Washington [George Washington High School; George Washington Educational Campus, New York, New York], took shorthand and typing then went out and tried to get a job in that, those fields, unh-uh, you couldn't get hired then, you know, so.  It's really something but you have to keep on, you know, just because somebody just, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you see any positive changes today?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  No, not really.  Not what I'm seeing.  'Cause I--children are not going to school to get educated and there's such a large dropout of youth in school and graduation and everything so I think that's my concern, you know.  So it'll only get worse but that's, that's, that's what I see.  You're young, when--and, and the difference between our youth and the youth that's coming in, the youth who are coming in are hungry and they're grabbing up everything and I don't, you know, if I was coming from another country, I'd be doing it, so it concerns me.  And then I must say in, in the schools, the school, the teachers have a difficult time, you know.  Children, the children don't have to obey, they, the teacher, and teachers, parents today--I would, I would, I have a minister who says children are, parents are the worst enemies of their children 'cause they don't teach them to be--people have no control over their children, look like they, so therefore there's a lot of problems like, so the, those are the kind of concerns.
Story_ID: 351620
Speaker 1: So to end this on a good note--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so that you go through the rest of the day feeling good, you've received a lot of awards, which ones, or which one has really meant a lot to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, golly, oh, wow, and that's a good one.  Oh, that's, that's hard, that's a hard one because all I've got, gotten from the, I've gotten from the, from the consumer, the consumer, a, there's the consumer groups, I think just that, them recognizing the work that I've, I've done has sort of made me feel, feel good.  And being with them.  In fact, I've been within the consumer field since the '60s [1960s], so I'm, I'm called an icon, you know.  So it makes, because and then you've, you've, they, I think I have something else I can show you, that they, that I'm history because I'm always spoken about.  And I, the, the thing about it, there were three of us in the consumer field and Father McEwan [ph.], Lou Meyers [ph.], and myself, they call us the troublemakers.  And to be respected and, by, by your, your peers, it's, that's to me, 'cause sometime everybody might be looking somebody to give an award to which is nothing wrong with that but if your peers respect you and look up to you that means a whole lot.

Speaker 1: Mrs. Florence Rice [HistoryMaker Florence M. Rice], okay.  We are going to continue our conversation from last time and maybe cover so- go back and forth a little bit to cover some things that I was able to discover since our last meeting.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so how did you become an advocate--
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) in the 1960s?
Speaker 2: I think I became an advocate, what happened in testifying in Adam Powell's [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] hearing and I was told that I better not and I, I think what, and that was my union, I was a union, you know, I, I always liked to say, you know, how important we think we are when you're union.
Speaker 1: At the time you were working as a seamstress?
Speaker 2: I was, as, ILGW [International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union].  And I was a chairlady and my business agent person told me that I better not testify and that I better not, I better, in other words he said if I did, I would, I would, you know, I would no longer work.  And I did, I testified and I no longer worked (laughter).  What he did was took away my, my source of living.  I often stop to think about it, if I, my daughter [Joyce Rice], at that time was married and I just wondered if I would have, would have, been, you know, had taken that kind of stand but I did and I, it set me on a, a journey, that I'd say a journey into the consumer field in which (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, like before we go on, let's talk about the, the day you testified--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --at the Adam Clayton Powell hearings.  And what was your testimony, what--
Speaker 2: Well, the fact that discrimination, and that we, we didn't say--colored didn't get the same opportunities and we got cheaper work, and just the way we were discriminated against in, in, in the consumer field just meant that many times the white girls would come and they would get the jobs and there were certain, certain places that we were not, they did not hire us.  So that's what happened.
Story_ID: 352126
Speaker 1: Okay.  So go, continuing. That led, so that from testifying you lost your job (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I lost, I, I lost my job.  And I found--but what I did I was able to relate the, I was able to relate the fact that what happened then, the effects that it had and because at that time in our community you had the door to door salesmen, a dollar down, a dollar, the dollar, yeah, and you paid for something for umpteen years, you know, bedspread or whatever.  And I began to relate the, the, the industry, how we were treated to the same way that, same way that the union [International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union] had handled (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were treated on, on the job, yeah.
Speaker 2: So I, I started what, started comparing prices, recognizing that our people, how they were taken advantage of moneywise, financial wise and being able to, what should I say, well, not, the fact of not knowing and being poor and not being able to get credit or what, not being able to shop, it just made, it made a difference.  I wanna give credit to also like I think it was Robinson [Cleveland Robinson] in District 65 who certainly gave me the, you know, gave me the introduction, I got a job at Mentor Bentley [ph.], and that was an education within itself, 'cause that was a furniture store.  And they later on sold television and the way they did, so it was very, very interesting because we paid the highest prices.  And I, I became very conscious of how we would, you know, how we were sold and, and the fact is that finance and, and the fact that I always like to say that you, you realize that your captured and there's nothing that you can do about it.  And at that time no one was really sharing that kind of, or telling you.  Well, I felt like we had Bush [ph.], the jewelry store, which I began to learn about jewelry and how the stuff they were selling up here was, I would say garbage and the difference in prices.  And I had a, a jeweler down Johnny [ph.] which I always like to give credit to, oh, good, a woman called Millie [ph.].  Millie, who took me down on the east, East Side [New York, New York], the Bowery [New York, New York] and I began, he showed me about jewelry and what, what to look for.  And that's where I began to, through Millie, my daughter [Joyce Rice] got, had gotten married.  I began to learn about the different prices you paid for furniture which my daughter said was I think about a thousand, over a thousand dollars, it only cost me six hundred.  Believe it or not she's still got it today, you know.  And she took me to Brooklyn [New York] and I think it was, a place called Broadway [ph.].  And I, I just began to learn the difference that the way we were being sold and the way the, the other, the whites were being sold.  And as a result of that I just went, went out being very aware that we were always charged more.  The fact is also for food, we found that we got inferior food.  So there was a lot of things at that period that I was aware of and I, what I was aware of I just wanted to share with others.  Once I began to learn the difference, had the privilege of traveling, going to the consumer conferences, that's when all I knew I wanted to do was share my knowledge with other people 'cause most of it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which stores did, I'm sorry, go ahead.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I realize that most people just didn't know.
Speaker 1: Which stores did you picket?
Speaker 2: Oh, golly, man, that's a, well Fleetwood was one that was here on a--
Speaker 1: Fleetwood?
Speaker 2: --125th Street.  We picketed Martin's paint store [Martin Paint], that--
Speaker 1: And you picketed Martin's paint store because--
Speaker 2: Well, they promised they were gonna give us paint and when we got there they said they were all out of paint and that was ten o'clock in the morning (laughter).  So I went down, took some of the, went on the street and just collected fellows I know, we got cardboard, you know, boards and we, we just started picketed the store, they did bring paint and gave out paint that whole day, that was, (laughter) that was interesting. And it was just educating my people and I just felt it was necessary 'cause it, no one else at that time, I thought, was doing it.
Story_ID: 352127
Speaker 1: Whose idea was it to put the book together, 'Shopping' [ph.], to tell people how to shop?
Speaker 2: We had this, well, Sister Christopher [Mary Christopher] from Seton College [Elizabeth Seton College, Yonkers, New York] and myself, I had ideas about the book, 'Shopping.'  And then the Japanese who designed the book that sort of the dos and don'ts and, and ifs of shopping.
Speaker 1: Can you just read some of those dos and don'ts, read a few of them for me?
Speaker 2: Oh, wait now, they, here we is see.
Speaker 1: Some of the things, some of the ideas you were promoting (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the dos and the dos was, it was real, it was really, and this was done so many years ago.  I said well one of the things was just a, do read the newspapers and compare prices, quality, and style.  Do comparison shopping, which I still say the same.  Shop out of your neighborhood (laughter) because the stuff that they were selling in your neighborhood, and today the same thing goes on.
Speaker 1: So you encourage people to shop out of the neighborhood, does that--
Speaker 2: I would shop, yeah, shop out of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, what about--
Speaker 2: --your neighborhood to get, to get better, better prices and better quality at that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: At that time, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Here, times have changed but I think it has.  But at that time especially food, food and I was reading an article the other day, someone was talking about the inferior food that comes to Harlem [New York, New York].  So I'm saying, reading the article I'm saying nothing has changed because there are some, it, it appears overall, let me say this, that there's no respect for poor people; there's none at all.  And we can throw garbage at them because they don't know.  And they don't know, know any better.  Probably with today more people are becoming aware in a different generation but when I was coming along and the generation after me it was certainly the attitude that they don't know any better so therefore we can charge them all the money that, and they'll pay it.
Speaker 1: What are some of the don'ts that you've written?
Speaker 2: The dos and don'ts, don't be misled by newspaper ad, TV, and especially today TV commercials and especially with the pharmaceutical, the drugs, that they be pushing on to the people that I'm just saying and the sad thing about it our generations today are much more gullible and they have completely, they, they believe what is happening is, is, is it.  Let me say telephone, bus, okay.  Don't be blinded by bargain offers and hard to believe and that's done today, nothing has sort of changed.  Don't be pressured into buying high priced merchandise like they used to tell you, Fleetwood have furniture three rooms for probably three or four or five hundred.  Or they would say that and then when, when you got there you never saw what you, what you wanted, you ended up paying, you know, I would say thousands of dollars, so it did makes a difference, so don't be--okay, rush for the golden opportunity.  And that they had the last chance the warehouse accepting articles that's not the same as you ordered and that would happen.  We said don't allow door to door salesmen to sell you merchandise, leave merchandise, have you sign a receipt, merchandise.  Don't sign a contract without reading it and I, that I tell today, you know, because what happens today a lot of things are done with contract, people sign contracts and don't never read them.  You know, I think I like to always say I came along when people were honest, so they were honest whatever, today there's no such thing as honesty, you know.  Don't, the other thing I always said read before you sign, don't, above all don't sign for relatives, friends, unless you're willing to pay now and maybe later for a bedroom set or TV set (laughter).  Don't make agreements you cannot meet, that was one.
Story_ID: 352128
Speaker 1: Was the book ['Shopping' (ph.)], was the book, did you get feedback from people?  Did, was it helpful?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I use this in my, my classes, I used to give them out to my classes 'cause we would just, the fact that it was, it would, it was, it was a new era and I just felt that, what I didn't know, and what I was learning I just wanted other people to know.  And I always like to thank Mattie Cook at Malcolm-King College [Malcolm-King: Harlem College Extension, New York, New York] for giving me the privilege of teaching there because as I love to tell people, I'm only an eighth grade student, with no degrees.  And I just felt that, and I always say it was Mattie Cook who gave me that opportunity to share.  There's some, I think I was there for eight, about eight, between eight and ten years that I was there doing consumer education.  So it's just important. It will--I like to see people who know to share that information with other people so I think that's important.
Story_ID: 352129
Speaker 1: Oh, here's what I said, used to say the if, if you fail to pay, you'll pay more.  And there's no difference between, one of the things in saying this we all know, you know, they have prime rate, well, prime rate was made for, I always say made for poor people because the interest rates, you know, go, you, you would purchase, you purchase, you go, you buy a mortgage and then the next thing the, that mortgage is sold to two or three other people, the interest rates are going up you're finding.  So I try to tell people before you go to buy anything, you get educated, don't go out there be buying, because they're selling and they're selling their, they wanna make a commission or profit so you don't expect them to tell you the whole truth and they're not in today's society they're not (laughter) you know.  If the credit for, you refer your debt to an outside agency and attorney you, you must pay a fee of 20 percent of the amount due.  And that was back there in the '60s [1960s] I understand, it's more, much more now.  And if you were make, oh, golly, one of the things if you make, what, when I'm saying this is you make, fail to make your payment your goods can be repossessed and when I'm saying that you must still pay remaining installment even though you lost your goods.  The amount can be collected through the court pointing out the importance of being able to make all your payments.  Remember if illness comes, you, you lose your job, how will make your payments?  These are things for people to consider.  Now they got an, a store right to own and I tell people just stay away from them because if you really don't know, and in, know, you know, sort of really know you'll end up paying furniture that, that you don't even have because they can come in and repossess it which they take you through that through court, the court, and you might find yourself paying for furniture that you don't have.
Story_ID: 352130
Speaker 1: I try to tell people you, anything you wanna do you better check it out first and any time you wanna sign, sign, and, in fact, you need a thorough education when you decide you wanna purchase or buy. So, my, my whole concern is that I would like to see this taught in school, people should come out prepared knowing how.  At one time the schools had ec- home economics and lots of time people today they don't so therefore I would suggest that, I would like to see consumer education taught in schools.  I found that by doing consumer education I was able to for my students bring them people in who knew, who was advocates in, in insurance so they were able to get insurance, they learned how to handle Con Edison [Consolidated Edison, Inc., New York, New York], the telephone company, and even to, to, their credit because it was very, it's very important that people know their, their credit.  And what's happening today, it saddens me, to see that our children are coming out of school and the high, the, from college, prices, I'm hearing seventy, seventy, one woman told me her child owes seventy thousand dollars in education.  Well, what bothers me when I began to realize how high the bills were for young people coming out of school.  Well, the sad part about it, employees--employers will not hire you with a bad, with a credit, a credit, a bad credit history.  And I tell them that's another, another form of racism because you will find yourself coming out of school and you're not able to get a job on account of you have bad credit already.  So that's one of the areas I like to talk to young people about and just sort of looking up and, if you have good marks in school there's so many scholarships around.  My nephew, one of my nephews went to school and for, and he went on scholarship I think I was told.  It was sixty-six thousand dollars that took him through college, well, that's some years ago, it wouldn't take him through today.  But it, it's very, my whole thing it's just very important.  And young people should really know about credit, I often say it's sad mothers and dads don't teach children about money.  And so therefore they get, get out to, you know, feel like they're adults already and they're so loose giving those credit cards.
Story_ID: 352131
Speaker 1: How did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They're in ties-
Speaker 1: --how did you meet Mattie Cook, who is, was the dean of King, of Malcolm-King College [Malcolm-King: Harvard College Extension, New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, Mattie was a great woman, she, she was a great person and it's seldom that I hear her name.  I often saying I'd just like to get enough people to even do something, you know, to salute her or honor her.  Mattie Cook, I believe had a, a nursery, it's--it's out as--for children and exactly I'm don't know.  I met her, well, you just, in the community you sort of just met, you met different people and Mattie was one of the people that I met.  And when she knew about, or heard about my work, she just felt that it, and then I, oh, okay, when I started, it was all volunteer, later on I got a stipend.
Speaker 1: To teach at the college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To teach at the college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you started it was, you were just volunteering, you--
Speaker 2: Volunteering, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So she created an opportunity for you to volunteer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And, and the, yes, and I did.  And that's, that's how I got my, you know, was able to do that.  It was, so just important.
Story_ID: 352132
Speaker 1: Now, you've also said that it could, that an educated consumer needs to know what capitalism is?
Speaker 2: The cap- well, cap- economics and capitalism and, and how democracy what, economics.  They definitely have to know, it's the fact that I call it a production that keeps going round and round and, and I also say that as a result of it, right now, you know, this is, this government, this government in America is how they bring in, they, I, I always say they bring in people and especially at the grassroot level and salaries are low and the people will come from other countries, it's more money than they ever made and they're willing to come, very willingly and to work because as you see today, most people in my, my generation who I always say did the scrub work, your young people that start out as a domestic doing, cleaning, cleaning people's houses, twenty-five cents an hour, a dollar and a half a day, you know.  And young, young African Americans I, or young people who are not going to do that.  So they feel they've gone, some of 'em going to school and, but most people don't, I always say start where you are.  One of the things that I notice young, the younger people today they don't volunteer to do any, any work and that the, it doesn't matter what color they are that everybody wants to get paid.
Speaker 1: Well, in the '70s [1970s], you were making some points that can still be made today.  I mean, some of the points you were making is that, that, you know, that work is being sourced out for cheaper labor which happens today (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it is so, well, the corporate world they, they look for, for where they can get cheap labor.  And they do, they source out mostly all the work.  You know, you can be speaking to somebody in India or, or China or some place today even with your bills.
Speaker 1: And you were saying this in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: That, you know, someone could, could, spoke to me the other day and they were reading something out of a book and they say, "You were talking about technology and economics."  I said--well, from how I saw things was that everything was economics and finance and in our, our community that wasn't, there were a few good people, we had people like Marcus Garvey and many, many people came down that road and, you know, tried to develop it on a whole.
Story_ID: 352133
Speaker 1: And then let me go back then.  What I, what you have to think about for the people who were brought here to America, they were, they were first, when they first came they were really treated as animals.  I think it was a time exactly, a time when, when that was, was changed but the fact is that they went in educating.  They, when they started the school, they started the schools for taking care of the master, not to educate us.  And so therefore we were, learned how to wash, cook, sew, iron, that's where the seamstress came in.  I always say George Washington Carver of farming.  And that's what economics and finance was never, that was never included.  So therefore we came over, you know, I also like to say even with myself, I never thought of, of a business or anything like that because that wasn't a part of, in coming up in the orphanage [Colored Orphan Asylum, New York, New York] you didn't get that that kind of, well, I would say that your foster parents did not, well you, you were different, you know, you were brought up in the, you were left there by your, your parents and so therefore you were a business, I always say you was a business to them, that you were a source of income.  And it's, it's, it has not been easy for us in this country let me say.  Racism still exists.  They had something on the other night on, I think, one, one of the CNN and it was, it, it showed a lot but it's still a, it, institutional racism is still here, still exists.  I've been out here many, many years and I, as far as getting, what should I say?  Enjoying what everybody else, financially, no.  You know, so one, one thing I love when I hear my young people talking about, I had somebody on my cable show ['30 Minutes with Florence Rice'], a young kid twelve years old and he spoke about economics and I was like oh, wow.  So it's given me an idea, I said any young person that's trying to get through school and studying economics and finance, I, I would try to, I'd like to help with the books.
Story_ID: 352134
Speaker 1: In the 1970s when you were one of the first people to teach consumer education, who were the other people to help round out the field, who were the other people that came on board and started to work with you?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I had someone, Fred Fleischman [ph.], the, the telephone company [New York Telephone Company; Verizon Communications, Inc.] was, would, were very supportive.  Flo Ke-, by, by the way, I wanted to say Flo Kennedy [Florynce Kennedy] was quite a, quite a support to me 'cause she let me know things, sometimes I would hesitate Flo Kennedy would, you know, give me that support that that that you really need.  It was difficult, there's a lot of things you just don't think of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were some of the things that Flo Kennedy helped you with?
Speaker 2: Well, Flo Kennedy gave you, well, any time you would sort of felt that you couldn't do it, Flo would always say oh, you know, you do it.  But what Flo did, we, well, one of the things we did with the telephone company they, which in 1972, The Nation magazine wrote the, wrote the story and we were paying in Harlem [New York, New York], we were paying installation for, for a telephone where, where downtown they were not.  In other words, it's like a deposit, you had to pay up front.  And the, the whites who were downtown were not doing it.  So we did a survey on that and as a result of that that was changed.
Story_ID: 352135
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your glasses were removed because you don't, you, you stopped reading. Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And one of the thing you like to say?
Speaker 2: Well, what I like to say because and I always like to tell people I'm only an eighth grader, what I did, I went to a number of sessions at different, what do you say, when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Continuing education sessions?
Speaker 2: No, what, what, what happened if there was something going on that would, held my interest, like I went to the George School [Henry George School of Social Science, New York, New York], a thing that I felt that I could learn from.
Speaker 1: What's the George School?
Speaker 2: Oh, golly, that might, I might, I know it was George School, they're down on I think 16th Street [sic.] or they--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --used to be in the 6th [Avenue], oh, golly, on the West Side [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: So if things were of interest to you, you participated (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But is, the fact is what I think I can say, I took advantage of a lot of courses and 'cause I've just felt that it could enhance me.  And it did.  I remember going to school to learn shorthand and typing, you know, just to be able to enhance and, and help me in whatever I was doing.
Speaker 1: It helped you continue to move forward?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 352136
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about an area that I'm going to name consumer politics.
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Which, yeah.  But just you, you became active and, and let's talk about some of the people that you had an opportunity to work with.  So you talked about Weiner, you talked about--
Speaker 2: Max Weiner, hm.  Oh, golly, there was a, let me, if I start talking, Florence Mason, because one of the things, me, when I was coming along my people were not interested in what I was, number one, I had no degrees, so one is, one of the things you began to, to learn that well, they didn't, when you're talking about economics and finance they just didn't seem to, when you start, make, you just make me go back to thinking about oh, when I gave my conferences.  They it, the, the whites would show up but there were, there were, you can almost count the blacks that would be there.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you had conferences every year?
Speaker 2: I had to, had conferences every year.  Like, like I say (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Who helped put the conferences together?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see, how do you do this?  We, people would send in support, I think I got the telephone company, the Con Ed [Consolidated Edison, Inc., New York, New York] co-, Con Ed, even though I'd picket them they would still send in, send in, I'm trying to think, I, I found it very, very difficult doing, doing the conference and yet get a good body of people 'cause when, I, I would say when you're talking about, in, in those days, now I think it's different, that but in those days, people were not interested in what I was, what consumer education.
Speaker 1: How did you get to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to do that work, out of New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, on account of, oh, that's a good question.  Oh, you just happened to meet, what happens--people find each other when, and they, they seem to all be able to understand and talk to each other, it's nothing else but talking.  And I think that's what, what happened.  Like a person, like Florence Mason, who made me a lifetime member of Consumers Union [International Organization of Consumers Unions], you know.  It's people with the, and it has nothing to do with colors, just the idea of people that you can talk with and on issues.  And that's what I, I found myself very, saying just what it was that, where, my people didn't wanna hear what I was talking about (laughter) that's all (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you, what did you do in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Oh, well we did picket, we picket I think at one time AT&T [AT&T Inc.].  And but we'd have regular meeting, we'd have meetings, consumer meetings, and people in Philadelphia many of 'em knew Max but we, it was just the fact that we're talking, everybody was talking the same, same thing.
Story_ID: 352137
Speaker 1: How did you meet McArthur [Harvey McArthur]?
Speaker 2: Well, through consum- CEPA [Consumers Education and Protective Association], consumers, I'm trying to think consumer or whatever, I, I can't remember but I know it was CEPA.  But how did we meet?  We're just meeting and talking and he was running for president and somehow Max [Max Weiner] was able to have me, have me on, on the ticket.  Don't ask me how Max did it but Max did.
Speaker 1: What party line?
Speaker 2: Consumer line, it was just consumer line and I was in a few.  In fact, one woman here in the Public Service Commission [New York Public Service Commission], she said she voted for me 'cause she saw me in Jersey [New Jersey], you know, my name on, on the ticket with McArthur so it was, it made, you know, we, it was, it was just good.
Speaker 1: How many votes did you receive?
Speaker 2: I don't know I think, you wanna, I know, at one time I heard we got forty thousand votes (laughter) so, exactly--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: So it, there, whatever it was, the exact amount of votes but I know forty, forty, forty or fifty thousand votes.
Speaker 2: How many states?
Speaker 1: I know, Ohio is one, Jersey [New Jersey] was one, I don't, we, I didn't take, I really don't know how many states, I really don't 'cause Max was doing all that, you know.  So I was just what you would, I was just, my name was there and that's, that was it.
Speaker 2: Well, how did that feel, how did it make you feel?
Speaker 1: Well, at that time it made me feel good that, you know, that some, somebody would pick me that to, to even run with a man like McArthur so it made me feel good.
Speaker 2: Why do you think he picked you?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I, I really don't know.  I haven't the slightest idea.  Now, it's going back so far I don't really, you know, but I was a consumer advocate and may, maybe the fact that Max and them figured, you know, have a black woman on the ticket would be good, (laughter) you know.  So, that's about the only thing I could say.
Speaker 2: Do you remember any conversations you had with him?
Speaker 1: With McArthur?  Truthfully no, none at all.  'Cause Max was doing all the--we, we, we were, I, I believe at probably meetings or sessions but exactly truthfully I don't remember at all.  You know, I, it was never that like I was very impressed, you know, you just, you're doing things but you're not doing it for any glory or anything like that, you're just doing it.  And that's, I had the privilege of, you know, getting that kind, kind of respect and honor, so that was it.  It was just something being done.
Speaker 2: Did that change people's view of you in the community?
Speaker 1: I don't think half the people even knew.  I don't think, I don't, 'cause I, I don't, it's hard for me to say, you know.  Some people like you, some people don't, (laughter) you know.  But that never bothered me.
Story_ID: 352138
Speaker 1: Well, in the '80s [1980s] you started to talk with Richard [ph.], Verizon [Bell Atlantic Corporation; Verizon Communications, Inc.] about putting something in Harlem [New York, New York]?  How did this whole Verizon project (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that was at the Public Service Commission [New York Public Service Commission].
Speaker 1: That was at the--
Speaker 2: When we, at the Public Service, at the hearings.  And it was just that I always say it was just like I'm talking like I'm talking to you, it was just an every day.  And my whole thing I was concerned because I had, had been reading a lot about technology, I think at that time in the '80s [1980s], I think had been overseas.  I saw how advanced the technology was moving, I was reading about it and I knew that we didn't have anything in Harlem.  And the only thing that I knew to do was to really, I had the, the privilege of talking to someone and I always say they're human beings just like you and I and--
Speaker 1: But how did you get the, to the air, how did you get to speak with the president and CEO of Verizon?
Speaker 2: Oh, easy, the hearings, it's no big deal.
Speaker 1: So he was at the hearings?
Speaker 2: At the hearings--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the hearings.  But it's no big, you know, it's, that was, they're, they're human beings, they're just like you.  If you're at these, places, hearings or fairs, you, it's, it's no, it's no big deal on talking.  And here's the time you can express your feeling.  What I liked about him that he listened.  That's really my whole, whole thing, that he listened.
Speaker 1: So you attended a lot of hearings?
Speaker 2: I attended hearings and I still, I believe, I would like to see more people attend them 'cause one person I like to say makes a difference.
Story_ID: 352139
Speaker 1: How did you get the opportunity to do the radio show on WLRD [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't, WLIB [WLIB Radio, New York, New York], I guess, you had the Honorable Percy Sutton out there.  And I, I, really when you those, I don't, I really don't know but it was really good that I got that privilege also that later on I was able to, through a young a lady, Jackie Roe [ph.], get on what's it?  Cable.  So you have to give, you know, people who help get you, you know, who gave you that, open that door, is opening the door.
Story_ID: 352140
Speaker 1: And what about your other colleague Dorothy Garrett?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's my colleague in South Carolina in Columbia.  She's having a terrible time now because she, we had a library down there and we had to close the library.  She had a Florence Rice library down there and it's, it's closed now.  And it's been very, very difficult because what Dorothy and I have been involved with, people don't support, you know, people don't support.  And then on top of that it's, they're, they're just not interested probably your generations coming along now, I think are, I'm, I'm learning more people are into economics and finance and to hear young people talking that makes me feel good.  But people are not, I, my, since you're speaking about that my, my ambition was really to have a international consumer organization and especially dealing with Africa 'cause there's a lot of consumer organizations in, in Africa too.  And, you know, that when you go to these international conferences and overseas that you meet these people, so I'd hope when I went to South Africa but what happened since then I've had my housing problem, so I haven't been able to do no follow up.
Story_ID: 352141
Speaker 1: Are you still in--doing battle with the landlord and the housing issues?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I have, I've been able to get my apartment back.  I had a very, I had three, I always like to say, I had three good people, Beverly Grigsby [sic. Beverly Grisby], she, she was excellent.  And then you had a Bill Moroski [ph.], and then Rangel's [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] office, mayor, golly can't even call me his last name right now, but there, there was, and there was a lot of good people who gave me I would say support, you know, that I was able to get my apartment back.
Speaker 1: Have you moved back in?
Speaker 2: Well I, my, my boxes have come from the storage but there's a lot of mouse droppings in 'em and stuff like that.  So, I was trying to find how do you handle that because you can't ask people to come in to help you because that, all that dust and everything goes into their lungs.  So it's, it makes it, I would say, it's not easy, so I haven't been able to settle in the way I want to.
Story_ID: 352142
Speaker 1: So going back to your days on the radio [WLIB Radio, New York, New York], you had a thirty minute radio program--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to speak with people, to, to talk with people about consumer issues?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  That's consumer issues.
Speaker 1: Did, on the radio was it a call-in radio show?  Did you take calls from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was one there, yeah, there was one that was call-in, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And on the call-in radio show do you feel you were able to reach people and to help solve issues in the, the community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) oh, yeah, well, on, yeah, on that, on that and also on cable ['30 Minutes with Florence Rice'].  I have a large audience out there on cable.  I'm shown in the Bronx [New York] and then in, in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: And what do you think it is that people, why do people tune in?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, what I try to do, what I really try to do is try to have, you know, I say you can always talk about the problem, what's the solution.  And sort of give people the strength or the information that they can, I'd like to see, see that people be able to help themselves and know where the information is and, and don't think that they can't do it.  I think that's important.
Story_ID: 352143
Speaker 1: So you were talking about your work in the international community, trying to--
Speaker 2: I'd like to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You'd like to--
Speaker 2: --I'd like to, I'd like to have a, have something that people could come here and, and see what we do here in, in America and just have a, that people could come, consumer organization, that we can hold consumer workshops, conference and have people here.
Speaker 1: Do you find that the consumer reports that are put out now, are adequate?
Speaker 2: I would say Consumer Reports, the magazine, I find it very helpful 'cause they cover subject, subjects that needs to be covered.  Yeah, I, I do.  And there's a lot, one thing there's a lot of, what I like today, there's a lot of information out there, it's not like when I was coming along.  There but, it, you have some very good people now who's doing consumer education.  I like to speak about many of the agencies that's out there.  That--
Speaker 1: What agencies are out there?
Speaker 2: Well you have the Federal Trade Commission, here, here, and you have the attorney general's office here, and what else?  There's a lot of, there's a, I find many, many agencies doing consumer work and that's, and that's important.
Story_ID: 352144
Speaker 1: Can you talk to me about Florence Mace [sic. Florence Mason] and how she may have helped you?
Speaker 2: Well, Florence Mason opened the doors for me as far as Washington [D.C.] and another union, union settlement.  I just, as I'm trying to--union settlement who took me first to, we used to go down to Washington and we met with all the legislators and, and it's just being able to know the top people 'cause when you know the top people you generally get a lot time get the things done.  It's good going in at the bottom but when you know the people who head up the agencies and they know you, you, and on top of that you can get, you can get things done.
Speaker 1: So did Florence Mason know several people that were able to help you?
Speaker 2: Well, Florence Mason knew, when I say not helped but it was like introduction, yeah, I was able to, to meet people.  We were, I was able to one time in Washington they had a great consumer office which they don't have now with Bush [President George Walker Bush] and, and when we had it there Bush, oh, goodness, hm, and Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], and there it was wiped out during that period there, there was no longer consumers so now there hasn't been a consumer under the, the president anymore.  I feel that the way things have gone that your corporate world is really controlling the, the, the, or should I say the corporate world, the, the corporate world is, is running the show.  When I look and saw what happened to the bankruptcy how the bankruptcy bills have been changed, how many of the consumer issues have been knocked out, so it, they're not consumer friendly.  I think it's people will have to pay attention to what's happening and I'm just saying that individuals, I'm, I'm no special person because individuals can do, do, make changes, it's what people believe would, that they could, that they can do and have faith in themselves, have faith in themselves.  If they feel that it's not right, it's not right.
Story_ID: 352145
Speaker 1: So in 1990s, let's talk about 1996 when this building [Bell Atlantic Technology Center; Verizon Technology Center, New York, New York] opened.
Speaker 2: Oh, we can, I'm very, I'm very proud of this build- I'm very proud of this floor.  I'm proud that I was able to make a corporate pay attention and main thing, that idea that people sort of, I'm, I'm proud we have a, a manager here, someone here who's opened the door up to the community to let them know they can use the center, so I to me, it makes me feel good when I see seniors coming in and learning how to learn the compu- use the computer, so it's, it makes me feel that I've done something.  And I always say well, I've left a good history behind but it's good, so.
Speaker 1: When you say you've left a good history behind, when you look back what are the, some of things you're most proud of that you've done?
Speaker 2: Well, oh golly, hm, oh, fun was it with the utilities, the--
Speaker 1: You mean fighting the utilities companies to change the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fighting co- yeah, fighting the corporations, make, make you feel good.  One of the things that I like, that also that I was able to with direct deposit that because black people didn't get the opportunity to have business, we had no businesses on 125th Street.  And for so long we were redlined and they still do that.  I have something here with my nephew, my nephew where he couldn't even, barbeque was a capital idea but he couldn't borrow any money from, from the, from the banks, and this is, and this, got paper coverage.
Speaker 1: What is, what is this article about?
Speaker 2: It's my, that's my in Fort Lauderdale [Florida], they refused to loan him any money.  Now there's, now that he can, he can borrow all the money he wants.
Speaker 1: So he was able to--
Speaker 2: But, he was, he was able to open up in spite of.
Speaker 1: So he opened his business without any loans?
Speaker 2: Well they, well he, they had a business, his father I think, if the, if I can remember clearly his father had the, they had the Jenkins Barbeque [Tom Jenkins Barbeque] in Fort Lauderdale and they was able to do it.  But they did it in, in spite of.  And it shows you, you know, family come together and pool their money together what they can do.
Speaker 1: So what was your nephew's name?  What is your nephew's name?
Speaker 2: It's my, my sister-in-law, I've, I haven't been that closely related and I, right now I can't remember the name but these, this is my brother's [Gilbert Rice (ph.)], my brother's wife, he's deceased.
Speaker 1: So Harry Harrell?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Harry.
Speaker 2: --they I understand they were two IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] young people that--
Speaker 1: And they worked at IBM together?
Speaker 2: They worked, I think that's what the story is, the story is there.
Speaker 1: But the thing that you're proud of about this is that they were able to--
Speaker 2: They were able to in spite of that's, that's what I and I think the last time I spoke to my sister-in-law she said that they had twenty-six people hired so that means a lot, that, that means a lot.
Speaker 1: So their business is growing well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What are some of the other things (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And believe it or not I haven't been down there at all.
Story_ID: 352146
Speaker 1: What are some of the other things you're proud of when you, when you think about your own history, all the things, when you look back?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I'm proud of the fact--
Speaker 1: The utilities you say were one, what were, what's something else?
Speaker 2: The util-, well doing the, the direct deposit.
Speaker 1: Direct deposit.
Speaker 2: The direct deposit.
Speaker 1: Now what exactly did you do with the direct deposit?
Speaker 2: Well, the direct deposit was just at hearings again and that's why I like to speak about hearings.  That to let them know that we were discriminated, we were redlined, you didn't allow it, we didn't, African American people did not have the privilege of borrowing money like you, your groups come in they can borrow it, they can do, they, they, they can do everything that we could never do as a race, they could.  And even today it hasn't changed, the show the other day in, what is in, Tex- showed you this town in Texas and how they feel about the race.  So as, as it stands to, to me, not too much have changed.  I know the younger people coming along think it has but institutional racism is still there, it exists.  And one of things I, I, I'll say cops shoot and kill black men, they, they don't go and like one of them, a speaker said they don't go into white communities and shoot up white communities but they will do it in black communities and have no hesitant about it.  And I think it's the training they get.  I think, I really think it's the training they get.  And it doesn't matter 'cause I understand that you have black policemen with the same, so it has to be the training that they get and that's the sad part about it.
Story_ID: 352147
Speaker 1: What have been the challenges for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, what can, what can I say?  Well, well, well, that's a hard question to ask, that's, it's, I would say oh, golly, the challenge I think that I had is, is I'd say in my early life is bringing up a, a daughter [Joyce Rice] at that time.  And being able to raise a, a daughter that I can be proud of now.  And I like to sort of to speak, brag about my daughter's been married fifty-two years to one man and the fact that I made even Son-in-Law Day, Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] gave me, son, Son-in-Law Day to, to honor black men 'cause Giuliani [Rudy Giuliani] had a, had a, you know, that black men were all criminals.
Story_ID: 352148
Speaker 1: So you spoke about Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] and you were gonna talk to, how you worked with him (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, well, what, what, what happened I, like like I said when I heard Giuliani [Rudy Giuliani] and, and the fact that he looked on, that I, I see he looked on, on, on black men, because my television showed it to me.  So I just wanted to let everybody know that there are a lot of good black men, take care of families, always did.  And to just to show black men in very negative every morning TV did, I just felt that I had to respond to it.  And I, what did I do?  I just wrote a, what is it, like, I can't, I just wrote--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  A bill?
Speaker 2: I didn't write a, it wasn't, you don't call it a bill, I forget what you call it, anyway I wrote--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  A proclamation?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  A proclamation?
Speaker 2: No, I just wrote, I guess is what I wrote a, a small piece of what I, you know, about black men.  And that they were good, good fathers and my, my son-in-law was definitely a good father, good husband, so with that I was able to get Son-in-Law Day.  And the Son-in-Law Day was his birthday April 20th, I mean 10th, see there I made a mistake.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: The 10th.  And as a result of that I was able to get Son-in-Law Day.  Now to get that on the calendar you got to petition it and, you know, get signatures which I haven't never followed through but I celebrate every April 10th as Son-in-Law Day and I hope that I can have a concert this year, whether I do or not I don't know.  But just for son-in-law, for black, to honor black men.
Speaker 1: So do you consider yourself, I mean, you, in the book 'Black Women in White America' [Gerda Lerner] I mean, do you feel that the role of black women, what do you feel is the role of, of black women in white America?
Speaker 2: Just like anybody else.  Just like anyone else, you do the best that you can, you can't do any better than that.  You raise your children.  One of the things that bothers me that I, I, I, it bother me because I see too many times children are raising the parents so and there's no, they're not that togetherness.  But it takes a, I'll say the African, what the Africans say, it takes a community to raise your children and people don't have that today.
Story_ID: 352149
Speaker 1: Have you done work in helping to have someone carry on the work that you've cr-, the initiative you've started (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I have, Dorothy [Dorothy Garrett], Dorothy in south, in South Carolina.  Here in New York [New York], I don't know, I can't say, you know, because I don't see 'em, you know, what, what, what's those that I thought have sort of all well, you know, certain circumstances make people drift away.  But I just feel, there's a lot of people, one of the things I like to give the attorney general's office from years back how they brought it, there is a, there is a lot of young people out there, you know, when they start me to thinking because in their office they have a whole, consumer young people coming in and they learn about, you know, consumer interests, well they work for the benefit of consumers.  So I, I would say, yeah, they're, I would say yes, there are because I know how, what they've done over the years, so there are, they might not be the Florence Rice [HistoryMaker Florence M. Rice] out of my organization but there are a lot and in civil, what they call civil suits, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what are future things that you're--initiatives that you're working on as far as consumer protection?
Speaker 2: Well, I just want, or I would like to do a few workshops, I still think that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And within those workshops--
Speaker 2: --identity theft is one of the biggest things that, that's out there.  'Cause anybody can take over your identity, that's no problem (laughter).  And the other thing is I'm, I'm very concerned about seniors and the fact that seniors are being stripped of their, well, are themselves and this whole housing that to know that seventeen hundred seniors could be removed from apartments, I think that's one of the things but what bothers me to see seniors just give up and not fight.  What else that that I'm trying to think, there, there is really so, really so much out there.  We are doing a, we have, we, a Marjorie Moore, we have a, through her under Harlem Consumer--we have a, what does it, Harlem Tenants and Landlords Reconciliation [Harlem Senior Tenants and Landlords Reconciliation Center].  We, the problem is we haven't been able to find space to really, you know, work, not that we don't help people but we haven't found the space so that what we have and hope that get people 'cause it, to me, to see--they talk about homelessness and no one, to know how they can dump people out of, of apartments it's, it's sad.  And I tell people, I say anyway who's been living in an apartment thirty-five, forty, twenty years, landlord wants you out and if you're not prepared to fight the landlord then you got, you got a problem.  And it's gonna take people coming together.  I admire Stuyvesant Town [New York, New York] how those people came together and it was just the, the people with the level of education, I guess, they had, knowing about coming together and they did a terrific job down there.  I am hoping that other people will be, do the same.  'Cause together, and until we learn how to come together we, you know, they'll, they'll always come in and, and do.  One other thing, what's a concern, it's a, is it Machiavelli [Niccolo Machiavelli], with diversity, you know, and what they do is bring, today they, they use all sorts of tactics, keeping people separated, when people learn that it's issues that brings people together and, and not whether, you know, what color you are or what race you are or what, (laughter) you know, the issues.  And I, they'll be changed whether that'll come along in my time I don't know.

Speaker 1: What positive changes have you seen come along during your time?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing, oh, golly that's a good, that's a good, a good question.  What positive change have I seen come along?  Hm, that's a hard question for me.  Hm, I don't have an answer for that.
Speaker 1: Well, what do you think about what a 125th Street [New York, New York] looks like now?  You have a lot of large retailers coming in, does that benefit the community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But that--we don't own anything.  We don't own anything.  So as far as I'm concerned is that, and they can displace us any time like they're doing now because we're, we, we don't own anything.  So I'm not saying that we wouldn't be doing the same thing 'cause it's all about money, greed.  But we don't, everybody, every, every other group owns and control except the, except us, people of color.  And that saddens me and that that saddens me.

Speaker 1: Well, what hopes do you have?  What are your hopes for the way you would like to see things?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's, hm.
Speaker 1: What are your hopes for the black community?
Speaker 2: What is my--well we really don't have a community that's the way I, we, we, we don't.  That's, changes are coming, I, I, let me look at myself that you realize that you really don't, you, you, you really, I, the hope that I have that one thing our children will understand and, and go to school, be able to, to be able to make decisions that will help to, to build and make, make this country a better country, that's well, I would like to see honesty which is, is no such thing as that I see today people don't just believe in being honest.  And what was, yeah, and I must say that, I tell you, oh, golly, there's a lot of things that, I would like to see that people, that people should treat people like they wanna be treated, maybe that doesn't.  There was something that I was, was going to say.  I, I would say about, one, one thing that, oh, golly it's, (unclear) there's so much and yet there's so many good things let me say maybe I should, it's good things that is happening.  Where, where, where people are concerned.  Because there are a lot of people out there in our community that I would say that is, is really working for the best interests of many people, you know.  And I don't, I don't believe in criticizing because criticism, anybody can criticize what I always like to say so you criticize what are you doing, what are you doing to make it better, what are doing?

Speaker 1: Why are consumer rights important?
Speaker 2: I think that people should know their rights, I think people should know how to handle, people should know how to manage their business, how to make good decisions.  And, and just how to, to handle, handle themselves as a consumer and we're all consumers because we're not manufacturing anything (laughter).  And so I think it's we, we need to be more or not knowing how to handle, mainly how to handle our, our, ourselves.  Golly, there's some good quotes.  I, I just, you know, say that every, everybody wants to, to have a better life.  And we had what's the name, Alma Johns [sic. Alma John] spoke each one teach one and continue.  And, and, and we have, there, there are people that I'd like to think about, there's an organization called NEDAP [Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project], that has helped me.  You know, one of the things I'd like to sort of say there has been many people who have helped me along the way.  And it wasn't for many of them I probably wouldn't be sitting here talking, talking to you.  And they're, they're, like I spoke at, speak on racism and that and, and the redlining and there was people like NEDAP that and what's it, neighborhood, what's it? Neighborhood Economic Development--I have to think about it, who gave me the, you know, so therefore I could speak, speak at the, probably say at the, the hearings, you know, having people sort of knowing that you're gonna speak and you can reach back and get that material, material, and that's, that's important 'cause you really don't do a lot of these things all by yourself.  There, there are people out there that's, they're--
Speaker 1: Is there a black consumer community?  I mean, by that, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) well, we're all--
Speaker 1: --educating community?  Are there--
Speaker 2: Not--
Speaker 1: --other people like yourself out there trying to, you know, like you spoke about NEDAP that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there, there are, there are.
Speaker 1: What are some of those organizations?
Speaker 2: The well, well I, I know Neighborhood Economic Development.  Then I, I and like I said I know that the attorney general's office is--
Speaker 1: Do you know any of the people that are at the Neighborhood Economic Development?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Who are some of the people there that are helping you make the changes?
Speaker 2: Well, Sarah [Sarah Ludwig], Sarah, golly, and through her group the, with, with economics and finance that you're able to when you go to the hearings you can, you know, you can, you can talk from facts because really what you find yourself, you, you have to, when you go into these hearings you have to have the facts and the figures and that's what, you rely on a lot of, there's a lot of people out there you rely on.  You really don't do it, when you think about it, you really don't do it all by yourself because you have people out there.

Speaker 1: So what is it you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  Well I, that's, I'd like people in, well, I'd like people to know about, learning how to, to what is it, take care of their own personal business.  Learning how to always be able to reach out and help someone else.  It's important, it's not always I, it's we and me.  It's not, what can I say?  I'm not, it's just always taking time to, to, to help somebody.  Coming down the road of life and above all I think one of the things that concerns me that learning how to be nice to each other, you know, I think that's one of the things that people are not nice.  That, and, and coming, I would like to say coming down the road of life is really it's how you treat people, how you don't, like some people will take and coming down and borrow and never pay back.  Some people leave a, a bad, a bad history.  So it's coming down the road of life, treating people right.  There's one thing that I always like to say, this person told me that they were on the, on the subway, and they were going to be interviewed and what happened this elderly lady was in front of him and he, he almost knocked her down trying to get where he was going and what got to him when he, when out coming out the door was this woman that he had almost knocked down.  So he said he knew he didn't get the job but if he'd a took and probably helped that lady, you know, and stepped aside and let that lady in, it's just that moment that he did not, and, and it's things like that people do because some time you never know where you're gonna meet that person again.  I always say treat people right going up because you never know who you're gonna meet coming down.  And I, the other thing I always like to say, you never know who's gonna give you that last drink of water.  And if people just learn how to be decent to people, that means a whole lot in life as you come on, come down the road of life.

Speaker 1: How do you wanna be remembered in the community?
Speaker 2: Just a person that was willing to share knowledge and information.  I think that's, that's about, that's about the only thing that I know I can say.  She treating, treating people right.  And one of the things I like to always say, someone told me a long time ago before you say something you become angry with someone, count to ten (laughter).  So those are things that, you know, that help you stay out of trouble and it means a lot.

Speaker 1: Well thank you very much for being a HistoryMaker.
Speaker 2: Oh God, I don't (laughter), I didn't know how good I was, 'cause there were so many things you, you know.  I, I, I hope to get a book out, I hope to 'cause I, my, my, it's so much in that you don't, sometimes people meet me in the street and they tell me things that truthfully I don't even remember, you know.  I had someone tell me how I kept his mother's lights on, and how, in some instances because at one time we had some money coming in, we had like a budget and we paid people's telephone and the, and that was never repaid back.  And paid telephone and Con Ed [Consolidated Edison, Inc., New York, New York] bills.
Speaker 1: What organization was that that had (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Harlem Consumer [Harlem Consumer Education Council]?
Speaker 1: Harlem Consumer.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Harlem Consumer.  We, because when people are gonna have their lights shut off or their, the telephone shut off, you, how are you gonna say no and you have, you have, you, you, you have money available, you can't, you, you can't.
Speaker 1: Does Harlem Consumer still exist?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I am Harlem Consumer (laughter).
Speaker 1: You are Harlem Consumer, okay.
Speaker 2: I am and (unclear) we're trying to revive it, you know, make it actually, 'cause I really would like to leave Harlem Consumer, you know, when I pass and at eighty-seven you don't know what, what's your next day.  But I would like to see it, and I'd like to see people carry on the same mission 'cause the mission is to help and help, help people and, and above all to help grassroot people be educated or the, the people up here, the middle class people but always help the person at the bottom.  I think that's, you know, and I never, I always, I always think of the underdog.
