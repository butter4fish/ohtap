Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Most likely I would say Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Favorite food?
Speaker 2: That's very hard because I like all kinds of food.  I would say, lets say, beef stroganoff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's nice.  I had beef stroganoff today.  And I--Also your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Pauses).  One I use a lot is "Don't bunch up.  One grenade will get you all."
Speaker 1: Don't bunch up.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) One grenade will get you all.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Oh that's--Where did you--Were you in the service?
Speaker 2: I was in the military yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and our Marine Corps drill sergeant used to say that for people when they would--You know, in squads if you ran someplace in combat, the key is to spread out (laughs).  So they don't all get taken out at once.
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: I usually say that to break tension some place.
Story_ID: 9537
Speaker 1: I noticed, by reading in your questionnaire that you were born in St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, I'd like you to first, you know, talk--And I know that both parents are remarried.  But I'd like you to talk about, you know, who your--What's, you know, growing up in, in St. Louis. And, um--How long did you live there?
Speaker 2: I lived in St. Louis until I was seven years old.  So my very early life I remember my father [Samuel Arthur Kaiser, Sr.] vaguely.  He would come in and out. Because he was still living in St. Louis at the time.  And spend a lot of time with my mother's [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd] grandparents.  Although even when I was very young, I used to go to school.  My mother worked at a cleaning operation in St. Louis.  And I used to go to school and come out of school and spend time with my father's mother [Cynthia Kaiser] or grandmother on my father's side.  So we lived in south St. Louis I guess it was.  And then moved out to Clayton [Missouri].  We had an older aunt who was a schoolteacher who lived alone.  And my mother decided to move in with her and kind of help her with her life.  So my brother [Samuel Arthur Kaiser Jr.] and I moved in with her in Clayton, which at the time was an all white community.  And very, very she, she--I guess you would call it (laughs).  And so we lived out there and went to school, to a Catholic school out there.  And I think we were the only blacks in the school.  And  it was a very interesting time.
Speaker 1: Well let's, go back.  Your father's name is?
Speaker 2: Samuel Arthur Kaiser.  And he was the senior.  My brother is Arthur Kaiser Jr. and he was a policeman in St. Louis.  And I mean spent time there.  And then he ended up moving up to Chicago.
Speaker 1: And, you said you'd spent time with his mother?  Was that--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right, Cynthia.
Speaker 1: And how much do you know about her background?  Or--
Speaker 2: A moderate amount compared to my mother's family.  That she came from the Tanner family.  And Henry [O.] Tanner the painter was related in some way.  And so she had a lot of Indian blood.  Which is why the high cheekbones.  We have that on both sides of the family.  And, and so, I mean, there's a limited amount known.  My father gave me some descriptions of family members and names, and we tried to do a family tree at one time.  But nothing compared to what was done on the mother's side.
Story_ID: 9538
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother.  Your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Jane Aileen, Gordon was her maiden name.  Married to Kaiser and ultimately to Floyd (laughs).  So she was born in St. Louis [Missouri].  In fact, in the house where my grandmother [Jane Ann Gordon] lived and say her mother lived.  And where we used to play when we were youngsters.  And lived there in the early days before we moved to Clayton [Missouri].  And her family has an interesting background.  On her mother's side is the Woodson family of the famous Woodsons from Sally Hemings and so forth.  So we can trace our lineage back to Thomas Jefferson.  Of course, that's under dispute (laughs).  But anyway.  And we go to family reunions for the Woodson reunions in Monticello and all that kind of stuff.  And then on her, her father [James Edgar Gordon]--her father's side again there was a full-blooded Indian lady named Lyons who married a Frenchman named Lyons.  And the story was that a group of explorers came through and found an Indian tribe.  They had a battle.  The tribe was kind of wiped out and they took this village.  I guess you should say.  And they took this child which happened to be my great, great, great or so grandmother and raised her.  And at the time, gave her a bunch of land which is now a major part of St. Louis.  And she grew up and became a nurse and traveled to Europe in the 1800s and lived in Paris [France] and so forth.  And was kind of center of culture at one time in St. Louis.  People used to come on Sunday afternoons and read poetry and all that kind of stuff at her home.  So that's the grandfather's side.  And then we have the Woodsons, as I said, on the grandmother's side.  My grandmother's father had a farm in Xenia, Ohio. where he used to take--my mother used to go as a child and play during the summers and so forth.  And they were descendents of the Thomas Woodson who came from Thomas Jefferson.
Speaker 1: Okay. 'Cause a lot of the, a lot of the people that were descendents centered up in Ohio right?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The story was that Thomas's well--The family oral history--And I think it's been documented now in films and so forth.  Is that while Sally Hemings was in Paris with Thomas Jefferson, she had a child.  And the child would have been born free in Paris.  And there was a deal made apparently that when they came back to the U.S.--If she came back with him the child would be freed on his 21st birthday.  So Thomas left the Jefferson household with money and horses and things.  Which was unusual for slaves to disappear.  And--He used to follow his slaves, but didn't follow Thomas obviously.  And he moved on from Virginia into Ohio, took the name of a friend named Woodson.  And, and, you know, met a woman, Jemima.  And married her and had a number of children.  And those children had lineage of different families.  And one of the ones was a George Woodson.  And we're the George family line.  And that was my grandmother's father's father. (laughs) Just to put it that way.  And he--His name was John Pen Woodson and he lived in Ohio.  And then he had a daughter named Jane Ann Woodson who married a Gordon, James Edgar Gordon who had my mother.  That's kind of the line.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  And did you--On, on the movie, did they have any particular--The Sally Hemings movie that was recently--Did they have any particular feeling about what--Did you see the movie?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did see the movie. I don't know what that means.  Everybody has their own feelings about how Sally was portrayed and so forth. The story was that she was obviously the half-sister of Jefferson's deceased wife [Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson]. Which if you think about that Jefferson's wife had passed away.  He was living at Monticello. As I like to say, in those days you didn't have television.  You'd read all the books and invented all the machines.  And you sit around at night.  And there's a beautiful woman that looks like your wife that's running around (laughs). He fell in love with her.  And so, she was reportedly very, very attractive. You know, fair skinned and so forth.  So the movie portrayed her as more ethnic than, than, oral history seemed to have said it was.  At least that's the spin that I've had from the parts of the family I've talked to. I did not go to the reunion this last time.  So I don't know what the official version was, or whatever.  But she--I mean the movie was reasonably accurate.  They did some drama with whipping and all that kind of stuff.  That I don't think was part of the oral history.  That's to excite the--or at least intensify the movie and make it more interesting.  But it was generally accurate from what I understand.  And it was well done and portrayed well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were growing up, at--You know, you said you lived there until seven.  Do you--Were you aware of this history at that point?  Or is this something that you came to learn--Okay.
Speaker 2: I--.
Speaker 1: Was this something you came to learn later in life?  Or--I mean were you awa--Do you remember any stories being told or, you know?  Or you know, as you said, you spent a lot of time around your grandmother.  You know, on your mother's--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, when we were young we didn't really pay a lot of attention to, to that.  I mean we were growing up and doing things that children do.  And running around making snowballs in the winter and playing football and things like that.  So the answer is no.  I don't recall any detailed discussions of it.  It's not such a big thing in our family that everybody is saying, "Oh my gosh! You know you're Thomas Jefferson's kid."  Or something like that.  So, but I think you know the information was there.  And then it kind of--On a--In a different note, when we moved from St. Louis to California on again on my grandfather's side--we discovered family in California.  Where one of the members of the family had left St. Louis, going west for the gold rush, started a new family out there.  And we ran into a whole bunch of cousins and folks out there.  That was more relevant at the time because we had family in Los Angeles when we moved there.  And talked about that.  And it was only later I guess, when Minnie Woodson pulled together what is called the 'Woodson Source Book' [1978]. Which was kind of the documentation of the lineage of this union between Thomas and Jemima and the children and their offspring that was compiled from the oral histories of these various sections of the family that had got to be very interesting and obvious.  And, and we began to attend the family reunions.
Story_ID: 9539
Speaker 1: When you moved to Clayton [Missouri], you and your brother now--Were there two, two, two--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Just one, one older brother.  He was four years older.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And his name?
Speaker 2: Arthur, Samuel Arthur [Kaiser, Jr.] and we call him Arthur.
Speaker 1: And um so, when--You said that it was interesting.  You know, growing up in Clayton.  And I was wondering what you meant by that?
Speaker 2: Well, it was an all white community.  We were part of the Cub Scouts, and Boy Scouts.  And we used to play and so forth.  But every once in a while there would be some racial remark that was made.  And there would be a fight.  I remember getting in fights as a young child with kids that would make some racial remark or whatever.  And my brother who is more brown-skinned than I am would have more of it than I did.  And was pretty good at fighting and (laughs) would usually win.  I don't think I ever remember him ever getting beat up or anything.  So, that kind of used to happen.  And we would get into disputes and stuff around racial issues in the school.  I don't mean that to happen like on a daily basis.  But frequent enough to remember it as that you had to defend yourself and, and whatever.  I had a lot of good friends that were, you know, young friends where no racial issues happened.  And we used to run around together and do devilish things.  And sneak around in backyards of people and all those kinds of things.  So, it was kind of fun growing up.
Speaker 1: You know, saying that you used to--got in fights so much.  I want to ask you during those first seven years are there any things that your parents--That you have memories of either with your grandmother or, you know, your grandfather?  Or just any memories you'd like to sort of share?  Times with your brother playing or with friends?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean there--There are lots of different memories.  Those were happy times.  They were--I don't mean to portray them as being desperate times or things.  They were the times of a young person, normal young person having fun.  We used to go between our grandmother's [Jane Ann Gordon] house and the house in Clayton. We had friends we used to have bean shooter fights, running around.  I remember we were chasing my brother one day across the street and he got hit by a car. (laughs) Flew up over the hood, landed on his feet and kept running.  Because we were chasing him (laughs) with bean shooters, all right.  Things that would terrify my mother [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd] now.  In fact do when we tell her about these things that we thought were normal kinds of occurrences.  The same thing happened to me.  Everyone was running across the alley.  It was an alley behind my grandmother's house.  And I ran out and got hit by a poor gentleman that was driving down the alley and ended up under the car.  I mean I--My whole body was underneath the car.  He stopped.  I remember pulling myself out and said, "Gee I'm sorry." And ran off and that kind of thing.  So they were lots of fun times.  Climbing in trees. Sleeping outside on cots, army cots.  And some humorous stories about the cots that were dry-rotted.  I remember in the middle of the night the cot split down the middle.  So I couldn't sleep on the cot.  I was kinda perched on the frame trying not to fall through.  Because it was such an old World War II army cot.  And our neighbors were both World War II veterans.  That had lots of relics, and Japanese flags and things like that from their campaigns in the Pacific.  So there were things like that.  I also remember my mother's involvement in the integration of the Catholic school system.  And I told you a little bit about the background of my one of the grandmothers [Cynthia Kaiser] that was an Indian that owned parts of St. Louis.  She donated some land for a Catholic church.  And you know, a couple of generations later when my brother went to go there, he was told he couldn't go because he was black.  And so my mother had gotten involved with some priests who were trying to integrate the Catholic schools.  It was Father [Claude] Heithaus.  And this is all documented in different journals and so forth.  And I remember them coming to the house and tal--You know, having meetings and talking about what they were going to do to try and get the archbishop to open up the schools to the Catholic you know, the Catholic schools to African Americans.  And she's very fair and she went and had an interview with the archbishop.  And he made a lot of derogatory comments which got in the newspaper.  And then he got called to Rome (laughs) for his behavior.  And while he was in Rome he passed away, unfortunately.  You know, I mean I don't ever wish that on somebody.  But the new person that came in, came in and integrated the schools.  And so, there was--There were those kinds of memories.  I didn't understand the full impact of it when I was there.  But I remember the priest coming and talking about it.  And, you know in the living room of our home and things like that.  So there were lots of different fun memories.  I remember school picnics and races.  I was very fleet of foot at those--in those days.  And we had all sorts of kinds of races and parades and stuff to celebrate different days.  And we had like Cub Scout meetings and outings and camping and all that.  So a lot of memories of those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 9540
Speaker 1: So your mother [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd] was, was she fair enough she could have passed?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you were to see her today, you wouldn't know whether she was white or black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever ask her--You know, it's always been curious to me, you know why?  And that's the case with your family.  Some were--The story goes that some chose white
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And some chose black.  But did you ever ask her?
Speaker 2: No, I mean, we always considered ourselves black.  On my father's [Samuel Arthur Kaiser, Sr.] side he was fair also.  But his uncle--I never saw his father [Samuel Evans Kaiser], 'cause his father passed away when he was sixteen.  When my father was sixteen.  So, so he was very young.  And my father kind of raised his brothers who were well, brown-skinned. So there was always mixed color in the family.  So--And my father's uncle, Uncle Lawrence, who was--ended up being a butler to a movie star out in California.  We used to go visit him in Bel-Air, (laughs).  Marion--I can't say it was Marion Davies.  It was somebody else.  I forgot.  But he was the butler there.  And we used to go out to this big mansion and see him and meet the movie stars and so forth.  But he was brown-skinned.  So, I mean, it just never occurred--I mean, she could have passed for, for white if she'd wanted to.  But she had a son that had brown skin, I'm fairly fair.  People confuse me today.  It's really funny a lot of (laughs) African Americans think I'm white.  So it just never occurred.  I mean it's always been a mindset--she was very close to Roy Wilkins and [Aminda] Minnie [Badeau] Wilkins and had always fought for the integration and, you know, all those kind of things from the early days.  It was kind of a network of, of people that she wanted to stay with.  'Cause you couldn't stay in hotels.  And so we'd stay in people's houses and stuff.  And still to this day my mother will say, "Oh, if you're going to Boston [Massachusetts] you must look up--," and give you a name, six or seven names.  Or, "You're going to Charlotte [North Carolina]--," I mean there was a network.  In some ways it's sad that that network is kind of lost with the young generations.  Including myself, I used to never look these people up.  And I kind of wish I had. 'Cause it would have continued as kind of a network that was part of our culture in the early days.  But, she, she never ever passed for white.  And always stood up and fought for, for civil rights and things.  And that is part of our heritage and part of our family.  And even is in my daughter [Lauren Elizabeth Kaiser].  I mean, when she was going to American University--She's very fair also by chance and she will stand up and eat your heart (laughs) when it comes to civil rights and things.  Because it--there's only been one way, one--I mean, she knows who she is.  And she is not white.  She has friends.  Most of her friends that she's close with are white just because of her environment.  But she knows who she is and there's never a question about that.
Story_ID: 9541
Speaker 1: Your mother [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd], how did she get to know the Wilkins? Is that--Were they--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, I think they were school buddies or something. I'm not sure exactly how they met or whatever. but I think my father [Samuel Arthur Kaiser, Sr.] went to the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota] for a while, I think and they lived in Minneapolis and--So I think in, through that connection, or somehow they got to be friends.  Or the Wilkins family, Minnie's [Aminda Wilkins] side was from St. Louis [Missouri] or whatever.  And--But they were friends, you know when they were young before Roy [Wilkins] was famous and all that kind of stuff.  And so, whenever they came from Minneapolis going east they used to stay at the house.  And that went on forever.  And then he went to become the editor, I guess of the paper first and then became executive director of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And their friendship stayed close.  And for all the years I can remember whenever he came through town they would spend time together, or he or Minnie or both and all through our lives.  And one of the kind of interesting points in my life, I was lucky enough--'cause my mother came east to be at their 50th wedding anniversary.  And at the time Roy Wilkins was in a wheelchair.  He had, had a stroke and couldn't speak very well.  But we flew down to New York and I took my mother.  'Cause she was getting on in years. And so I got to go to the 50th anniversary party.  They had it at the Algonquin Hotel in New York City and a lot of very influential people were there.  Thurgood Marshall came, Leontyne Price sang for them and so forth.  And I remember having the chance to say to Roy you know, I wished him happy anniversary.  And I took his hand and said, "Some of us are beginning to live the life that you dreamed of."  And he cras-, grasped my hand and held it so tight.  'Cause he understood what I said to him.  And wouldn't let go.  Just to say, you know, "Gee that's really important."  And it was just my way of trying to say thanks for all the sacrifices and risks.  'Cause he could have earned a lot more money in a different vocation. and he was kind of the, kind of the intellectual spokesman.  I mean different people had different roles in the civil rights movement.  And [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] took a role of activism and peaceful protestation and those kinds of things.  Roy was kind of the guy on 'Meet The Press' that fenced with people on an intellectual level about race relations and stuff.  And we used to hover around the TV and watch him do battle with three or four reporters who would try and trap him about race issues and so forth.  So each person had a different role.  Whitney [M.] Young--We still see Margaret Young from time to time in Denver [Colorado].  She lives in Denver.  All those people had different roles.  And--So it was part of our history, part of our growing up that started with the priest [Father Claude Heithaus] (laughs) in the living room back in Clayton [Missouri].  And that priest got exiled someplace (laughs).  His reward for having fought for the integration is he got sent to some parish like in northern Minnesota or something.  Where it was cold and out, out in the middle of nowhere.  It was interesting.  Another side is later in life when I went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to the Sloan Fellows Program [in Innovation and Global Leadership], there was a Jesuit priest in that program.  A guy named Nick Rashford who last I saw was president of St. Joseph's University.  But anyway, he had done research on this whole process.  And knew of Father Heithaus, was the guy's name. The priest that came to our house, and kind of what happened to him.  And all those kind of things.  So it was very interesting history. And he was really excited to meet my mother who had been involved with it.  And, you know, the newspapers and all those kinds of things.  So all those--you asked about the memories.  Those were all part of the fabric of who I am as a person, who our family is through history. And it's kind of ingrained in me that you're supposed to fight for right and do right, and those kinds of things. It's just part of the background, part of the culture.
Story_ID: 9542
Speaker 1: Do you remember anything that was talked about or conveyed really, through your parents or your grandparents during that early period that stuck with you?  Any, you know, any sayings, you know lessons?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Well--I don't--I can't think of specific you know, thing.  My grandmother [Jane Ann Gordon] always used to say--my grandmother was a very, very kind person.  In fact she was my most favorite person in my life at that period.  'Cause I never remember her, you know, having an angry word without love behind it.  Or she used to spank me every once in a while and then come and hold me as I cried.  She was a very, very kind person.  My grandfather [James Edgar Gordon] was a postal worker and so he worked on the trains at night and traveled.  And what I remember most about him is he would come home and we would have to be quiet. 'Cause he was sleeping. (laughs)  So we didn't get to talk to him much or see him much until later in life.  Where I got to know him a little bit better.  So there aren't any sayings like that. In terms of values my mother [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd] always instilled that, you know, that you needed to try hard and do your best. And for example, she was a school teacher.  So if you went to school it was acceptable not to be smart.  But it wasn't acceptable to be disobedient.  So I could get an F.  They used to have grades for you know, obedience and attendance and those kinds of things.  So we used to get like an F-E-E, excellent, excellent or satisfactory.  I had to get the EE's no matter what the letter score was.  I mean, she would coach me and say, "You know, your smarter than to get an F." But boy!  If you got a A-U-U, which is unsatisfactory, but scored high. You'd get a spanking just as quick (laughs) as if you'd got a you know, an F on the other side.  She was very, very strong.  Said, "Try hard, be obedient, don't, you know, don't disrupt the class."  Those kinds of values.  And that the expectations were high.  That, you know, you should be proud of your background to be an African American was a thing of pride not a thing of, gee, we're a downtrodden people or something like that.  That our heritage was a rich one and to be very, very proud of that. In fact, later in life I had someone when I was in the Sloan Fellows Program [in Innovation and Global Leadership] ask me, "Gee wouldn't you--aren't you disappointed 'cause you're not white?"  And, "Wouldn't you really rather be white?" And I said to him at that time something that was harsh and probably I shouldn't have said but I said, "I think white people lead dull, uninspired lives."  And it just shocked him.  And I said, "I get to live in several different worlds.  I'm proud of the fact that I'm African American.  I can, you know, run with anybody in terms of intelligence or skills or whatever.  And why would I want to be white?  I mean, why (laughs) would I do that?  I think we have more fun living in two or three different worlds and have a rich culture."  And I mean he just was shocked.  'Cause he said--just assumed that it was much better to be white than it would be to be black.  And what a disappointment.  I mean, what I read from his comments was what a disappointment it must be because you happen to be black and can't reach your potential.  And I just found that to be kind of an uninformed, stupid statement.  So, I think those values came from a mother who was proud and always expected her children to go to college, and do well, and to excel and--So there was never any question.  I mean there was just you just do this.  And when we were at school, even with, you know, problems and stuff.  She would go stand up for us and those kinds of things.  I mean, raci--racial issues if there--if we brought those home.  I mean we'd be back down at the school in ten minutes, talking about it with the teachers.  And saying, "This is unacceptable." And those kinds of things.  So I mean she just had high expectations for us.  And that was just the way it was.  And that's kind of the way it is with my daughter.  I mean she never had a choice not to go to college.  That was assumed and in the model.  And that she should do well and go forward, do--You know, go forth, do good, avoid evil (laughs). That kind of thing.
Story_ID: 9543
Speaker 1: One of the things that I don't want to leave the impression, is that the Woodson piece ['Woodson Source Book', 1978] is an important piece to the family, but there's just as much pride about the, the piece--I mean the--Nancy Lyons lived to be 107.  Her, her name was Washinga.  An Indian name and she lived to be 107 years old. in fact,  I even brought with me an article that, that describes her and so forth when she passed in St. Louis, passed away.  That is just as much a source of pride in the background in that side of the family.  Which is my grandfather's [Samuel Evans Kaiser] side on my mother's gra--father's [Samuel Arthur Kaiser, Sr.] side--as the Woodson thing is.  The Woodsons thing is only one piece of our background.  In fact, there's oral history that claims to be related to the painter Henry [O.] Tanner and to possibly another president through another linkage and so forth.  So I don't want to leave you with the impression that, "Oh because you're a Woodson this--You know, because you could be a descendent of Thomas Jefferson, that gives me some legitimacy as an African American." Just as, just as I think the Jefferson family is assuming because it's Jefferson that everybody wants to be buried in Monticello.  I could care less about being buried in Monticello.  'Cause Thomas never did anything for me in my life.  So, I mean it's a, it's an important part of our history.  But it should be put into the context that's only one of the cornerstones of, of who we are as a people, or you know, as a family.
Speaker 2: Who is--who's doing that down there?
Speaker 1: I don't want to leave the impression that the other pieces of the family contribute just as much in the pride and who we are.  I mean I took my daughter [Lauren Elizabeth Kaiser] back to, to look at the origins of that side of the family. in Missouri, and in, you know, all th--Where the Indian village was.  And in fact, on my wife's [Kathryn Mounday Kaiser] side, she can trace her family back to the same, same area in Illinois, Kaskaskia, Illinois.  Which was a major Indian center.  So that is of equal pride.  And as my daughter would say, "You have probably almost as much Indian blood and even white blood as you do African American blood in your background.  So, who are you really?  You're a combination of things, and you're who you choose to be of all of that."  So I want to put it in context.  I think it's important.  But I don't want everybody--Everybody is wowed by it because it happens to be something that's been in the news lately.  But the other side of (laughs) the family is just as important.  There's just as much blood running from that side.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Let me ask--Let me ask you this as it relates to, your, you know the--Was it your great grandmother?  The, the 107-year-old Indian.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Do you know much of that history?  Because there was a lot of interlocking, you know, in a relationship between, you know, the slaves and the Indian population.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Well, we know some of it.  I mean she had--She married a Frenchman named Doré first.  And had a couple of sons by Doré.  And again, they had money for those times of year.  And one of the sons, Felix, had a, had a, a roadhouse, I guess you would call it.  Where the train stopped for feeding people.  And one of the stories is that Jesse James and all of those folks used to come into the roadhouse and eat.  And he was a guy who was very fair, looked like Uncle Sam is the way they used to describe him.  With a big white beard and used to drink a lot and ride his horse in the movie theatres and buy tickets for everybody and stuff.  I mean he was a kind of a colorful individual.  Then she married another guy.  A steamboat captain named Lyons and he went to the Worlds Fair in London and did that.  And eventually I think got blown up on a steamboat accident, going up and down the Mississippi River.  So I mean there's a lot of other things.  She was a nurse for a wealthy family that took her to Paris.  And she lived in Paris while this gentleman was ill for two and a half years, spoke French. There was even a story that she traveled to China.  When she--'Cause with this very wealthy family back in the 1800s.  Which was a heck of a journey. It still a big journey today.  But, but those were very unusual things that kind of eclipsed the [Thomas] Jefferson thing in terms of its cultural impact.  So, that's why I say it, it--To me there's just as much pride around that as there is around the Woodson thing.  But the Woodson thing just happens to be on TV.  And they're making movies about it now after, you know, I'm fifty-seven years old and in my 55th year or so (laughs) all this got to be interesting. So the pride in the family comes from who we are and the values that you have and, you know, what was instilled in your mind.  One of the questions you asked me earlier was "Do you have a favorite phrase?"  Another favorite phrase is "God bless the child that's got his own." And, you know, that led me in the second half of my career to go to entrepreneurship as a choice.  Rather than working for another, another corporation.  So, I mean, there are a lot of things that are--that make up an individual and a family and the values and so forth.  And those were a couple of them.
Story_ID: 9544
Speaker 1: You at seven, you moved to Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What precipitated that move?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd] tells me that that there was some interaction between she and my father [Samuel Arthur Kaiser, Sr.] where, she wanted to put some distance.  I don't think it was abusive and stuff, but she just wanted to start a new life.  Get away from the old life and that kind of thing.  And so we took a vacation to California in 1950 with my aunt.  I guess she would have been my great aunt actually.  Which was my fa--mother's father's [James Edgar Gordon] sister--that's who we were living with in Clayton [Missouri].  And we drove her 1948 Dodge across the country.  Which was one of the interesting experiences because her two sons got to see all the dir--The Grand Canyon, the Painted Desert, all those--Yellowstone [National Park], all those things.  And the year after my mother flew out at the end of the school year, got a job for the summer. And then we fle--actually our first airplane ride flew out to California to live in California.  And it was when we made this visit in 1950 that we discovered other portions of the family.  Again through the social network.  "When you go to Los Angeles be sure to look up--."  "Oh gee, your relative was--oh my God! You know, we're related." That type of thing.  And so we lived actually with a cousin during the summer that we had met. That was new, you know, new to us part of the family.  And my mother got a little part of duplex.  Rented the downstairs from my lifelong friend, the upstairs guy.  That lived upstairs with his mother and father.  And she started teaching school and we started a new life in California in 1951.  And the key to me is I got to play all summer at my grandmother's [Jane Ann Gordon] house.  And then we flew on a TWA [Trans World Airlines] Constellation, the first flight from St. Louis [Missouri] to Los Angeles.  A big defining flight.  And I ate a pound of chocolate on the way (laughs) my grandmother had given me--got sick. (laughs)
Speaker 1: That was pretty exciting really when you think of it.  You know, people and air travel wasn't what it was.  That's a big, big deal.  A--.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And so how did you find L.A. [Los Angeles]? I mean I know you were still--but how was that different, you know, for you?
Speaker 2: Well, Los Angeles was a, you know, totally different experience.  First, the one interesting thing is all the friends I had there seemed to be taller.  There was something about the weather (laughs) or whatever that was more conducive to making people grow taller.  And my brother [Samuel Arthur Kaiser Jr.] and I seemed to have grown taller than our cousins living in Los Ange--I don't know whether it was the smog or whatever.  A non-scientific observation.  But we kind of enjoy it.  The weather is so much nicer in those days in California.  And California was kind of the promised land.  Not so crowded, beautiful weather, Hollywood, farmers market, Knotts Berry Farm.  All those things were really nice places then.  And it was fun, fun to go.  It was a new life, new friends. As I said I met a--The house we moved into was a--The people that owned the duplex lived upstairs.  And they had a son that has become a lifelong friend.  We're still very close friends. Even have tried to do some business things together.  And it was fun growing up with him and, you know.  We went to Catholic school again there in Los Angeles to St. Gregory's [Catholic School].  And I played on the football team and the baseball team and got the letters.  They even had letters in grammar school.  If you could imagine that then with--so I had a letter in football and baseball and had a letterman sweater and all that kind of stuff.  So it was fun and had a group of friends who were more like me.  These were African American friends. Some white people were in it but primarily African Americans in this neighborhood which I didn't have in Clayton.  So it was a good, stable environment. My mother provided a great home for us despite being a single parent. We used to cook dinner sometimes.  And certainly cook breakfast on the weekends when she was trying to recover from working so hard.  And I think back about how hard she worked to provide that environment.  'Cause she used to work year-round with no vacations for years and years.  Which to me amazes me now.  'Cause I probably take three, four vacations a year.  And she would go three or four years without a vacation.  And, and the work she put in to helping us grow up and the sacrifices she made as a single parent.  And all of those kinds of things.  I know that she used to date different people, and, and she would always involve her children with that.  And I think didn't marry for years because of the worry about how the impact would have on her children.  Particularly my brother who had known my father much more than I did at that point in time.  And our father would come out once or twice a year and spend an evening.  And take us to a ball game and stuff like that.  So, it was, it was a good environment and my brother thrived.  He was getting straight A's in school and all those kinds of things.  So it was a good healthy move and a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 9545
Speaker 1: Do you think that there was a point--well maybe your brother [Samuel Arthur Kaiser. Jr.] more than you, than you missed your father [Samuel Arthur Kaiser. Sr.] and him being around?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, I think my brother did more than I.  'Cause I think my father left when I was about two.  So I don't have an active family thing.  I mean there were a lot of discussions of what had taken place because of the divorce and those kinds of things.  But I didn't have any direct memory of the incidents or whatever or the disappointments that had occurred.  So it was different for me than it was for my brother.  Who had--you know, being four years older was a major different in age, at those ages.  Ah, so I mean the impact of, you know, not having a father, the things that would manifest itself like at St. Gregory's [Catholic School, Los Angeles, California].  There was a father/son breakfast so I always had a problem because I didn't have the father who was present.  So usually my mother [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd] would have a friend or perhaps a boyfriend who would substitute for those breakfasts.  So I would go.  But it would be with a, you know, kind of a friend.  An uncle, if you will, rather than a direct bloodline father.  But I didn't--I never thought of it as a big disappointment.  It was kind of an inconvenience to me.  And I wasn't hurt or anything like that.  I think for my brother it was different. Then--he's, he's probably more sensitive than I am also, just by nature.  So it was very different for him.
Story_ID: 9546
Speaker 1: Now, what was the young Jim Kaiser like at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh. (laughs)
Speaker 1: You know, what was he--Was he introspective? Was he outgoing?  Was he precocious? Was he--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) All of those things, (laughs).  I don't know.  I, I was very athletic. I would describe myself as a little devil.  Always kind of you know, full boy, I'll put it that way.  I can remember at St. Gregory's [Catholic School, Los Angeles, California] having a water balloon fights in the church.  We used to ring, what they called the Angelus.  Where we'd ring the bell twelve times at lunch.  And we always used to add one just for fun.  I mean we used to be kind of playing sports, having fun, devilish.  Never into real trouble.  But you know, get caught in class talking and stuff like that. Just having fun.  Rode our bicycles.  I used to, you know, we had teams as I said.  So we had a softball team at St. Gregory's and I was the youngest one on the team.  I played first base 'cause I was smaller but was good enough to be on the team.  I had the team record for stealing bases 'cause I was very quick--things like that.  So, and I played with the senior classmen which was unusual. So they always--you know, (laughs) it was kind of interesting for that because you had this different perspective.  But, and I went to St. Gregory's, my friends went to public school instead of Catholic school.  And so they all had a different life at their school.  And I would come home and we used to do things in the back yard.  We were very creative.  Used to have like at the Olympics where we would set up races and hurdles and, you know, track types of events.  We used to have to run around the block, had stopwatches and time everything.  We used to make records.  Not records but tapes, and do songs and like little shows.  I mean, we were very, very creative when I think about it.  We had a--in the backyard we had a lot of dirt.  And we used to make little towns and buildings back there and do all sorts of things.  Play like we were paratroopers and jump off the roof of the house and (laughs), things that would terrify a parent.  But we did all those things as children.  My brother [Samuel Arthur Kaiser, Jr.] had a different set of friends.  I didn't really play with him much because of the age difference.  And he was involved with what he did.  And I had my group of six or eight friends that went everywhere together.  Got into all sorts of mischief is the right word.  Mischievous, a young child running around bicycling everywhere.  We used to bicycle to the beach, you know, fifteen or twenty miles and back on the weekends.  And it was, I think, a very healthy fun way to grow up.  And all those folks are kind of lifelong friends now.  We see each other rarely because I moved away from when I joined corporate America.  Again, corporate--Not being in corporations kind of focused the black community on folks.  But when you grew up and begi--You know, they had--Everybody had professional lives and things.  But when you grew up and you got into corporations that moved you all over the world.  It kind of split up what was core interfaces within the community.  Which was different.  So, it was, it was--I mean, we had a good time.  I enjoyed those days you know, full of mischief, full of energy.  We used to have bicycle races.  We actually swept away, if you can imagine this, swept away all the dirt in the backyard and set up a racetrack.  And we used to have six of us that would race our bicycles in circles.  And you'd go around so many times that you'd get dizzy and fall over (laughs).  And we would run over each other on the ground doing that.  We even set up boxing rings back there at one time.  So, I mean, we used to do everything and I think that was a very healthy way to grow up, a lot of fun. We had, my friend had a train set and they had two garages, only one car.  So they'd--his father had built a model train set in the garage.  And we--Underneath the train set we had--There were boxes and things and we had a secret hiding place.  With, you know, little candles and stuff.  So we did everything.  The neighbor had a yard full of shrubs and stuff and we used to play like that was the jungle.  And we'd go to the Army surplus store and put on our helmets and crawl around like we were, you know, fighting World War II in the jungle, and so forth.  We used to do all sorts of things and have fun.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Sounds, it sort of sounds very wholesome really.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 9547
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was probably A-, B+ somewhere in there. I was pretty good at, you know, at doing what I needed to do in school.  I didn't have any trouble getting things--You know, getting good grades generally. So I was, you know, all this college potential.  And I'd usually get B's or so in math and A's in history, those kinds of things.  So you know, I was, I was doing fine in school.  Altar boy.  And we used to sneak wine behind the altar. (laughs) After the priest was finished, we'd get a couple of sips ourselves and stuff.  So, I had, you know, a good school environment.  But then, I should add our life changed because the great aunt who lived in St. Louis [Missouri] and my mother's [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd] mother [Jane Ann Gordon] and father [James Edgar Gordon] decided to move to California.  And they all combined resources and moved to a big house.  And that precipitated a move out of the neighborhood where we were.  And I can't remember what year that was.  But I was in junior high school, I think, at the time or just about.  It was the end of grade school going to junior high school.  And I transferred to the northern part of the city to junior high school, Thomas Starr King Junior High School [Los Angeles, California].  And we bought this house up in the Silver Lake district.  Which is now, one of the posh old districts.  But at the time it was a very nice neighborhood. It overlooks a reservoir. And we had all the families come together.  So you have capitalization.  Where my mother didn't--couldn't accumulate capital now you have the two houses that were sold and pulled the value to get in to one bigger house--A more expensive house.  And a young woman, a single woman with two sons now caring for three elderly people.  Which you think about that, that'll take your breath away. (laughs)  And it changed our lives dramatically.  I think at the time my brother [Samuel Arthur Kaiser, Jr.] was just graduating from high school.  And we had another precipitous thing.  Because there was a dispute between my mother and father [Samuel Arthur Kaiser. Sr.] as to where he was going to go to school.  And he had applied for and was accepted at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].  The tuition since that's a private school was very expensive.  My brother went to Chicago [Illinois] to live with my father for the summer to work to earn money.  There was a misunderstanding about what the money was to be used for.  My brother thought he was going to buy a car.  My father thought he was going to apply that toward his tuition.  And what happened was there was a dispute.  My father decided not to pay the first semester's thing.  And my mother and he had a big fight.  I remember going to the hotel where my mother and stepmother [Margaret Gaines Kaiser] were.  He was remarried at this time.  And there was this huge awful blowout fight about missed expectations.  And the end result is my mother decided she would finance my brother going to school. And he went the first semester, at great sacrifice to her.  And after that, because he was sensitive I think he decided to join the military.  And, you know, relieve the problem.  Which I think changed the direction of his life.  For which my mother never forgave my father.  'Cause of that.  'Cause my brother went up and joined the Air Force.  And went off to Texas to Lackland Air Force Base for basic training.  And then ended up going to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] to learn to speak Chinese, if you can imagine that. (laughs)  An African American speaking Chinese.  And then for secret types of work on Okinawa [Japan] listening to Chinese military transmissions.  What I think turned out to be overflights over China. It was a '60-Minutes' special on this at one time about the people that were lost flying over China.  Testing their response times and so forth.  And these were people that learned Chinese and all that kind of stuff.  At Yale and would listen to the Chinese military broadcasts.  They would scramble aircraft intercept overflights.  Okay.  I think that's what he did.
Story_ID: 9548
Speaker 1: You were saying that your brother [Samuel Arthur Kaiser, Jr.] was studying, you know, Chinese--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --For the military, and there had been a special on '60 Minutes' about--
Speaker 2: Right.  And he ended up you know, working on Okinawa [Japan], doing this kind of stuff.  In fact I think he was offered money if he would get on the airplanes and do it.  But that's where you could get killed because you'd get over China and didn't make it back out.  You got shot down.  And there are a number of people that were lost, fifty or sixty people I think.  In the end that's what the special on '60 Minutes' was about, these people getting lost.  And they were just unsung heroes because nobody ever knew about them and it was secret stuff.  But any way, so my brother joined the military. And as a result of that, as I was indicating I, I kind of got a break.  Because when it came time for me to go to school because of the pain of that kind of discussion and the impact, my father [Samuel Arthur Kaiser. Sr.] just said, "I'll--You know whatever it is.  Wherever you want to go, don't worry about it.  It's done."  And--'Cause that was--there was there was a great rift in the family.  And I should add here that my father was a good provider.  I mean, he--And my stepmother [Margaret Gaines Kaiser] had told me this.  When they got married my father told her, "Look I have two sons and they come before anything that we ever get, all right?  So, if we're starving, I'm sending money there first."  And he did.  He provided child support until we were twenty-one, I think it was, and those kinds of things.  I think this issue around school dealt with miscommunication about expectations.  'Cause my brother had this, you know, thing about cars and wanted cars.  And my father was a person who'd kind of raised his brother since his father [Samuel Evans Kaiser] died when he was sixteen.  He was very, very, kind of strict about, you know, "You should focus your resources and make sure you have enough to do what you need to do."  And, you know, he quit school and worked to get his two younger brothers going and all that.  And so he expected my brother to work and put his money towards education.  And when they argued about that then he said, "Well then if you, if you can't put your money to it why should I put my money to it?"  Type of point.  And as I said, that created a nuclear explosion in the family and led to my brother leaving.  But anyway, back to the house.  So we all moved into this big house.  My brother was there, I don't know, six months a year.  Then he went off to the military.  And then--So I was kind of the young man of the house, if you will.  I had a grandfather [James Edgar Gordon] who was living there.  He'd had a stroke and lost a lot of weight and was kind of, mobile and could drive and all that.  But couldn't do heavy work or whatever.  And then all the rest were women. Great aunt, grandmother [Jane Ann Gordon], mother [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd]. I learned from that three women can not work in one kitchen.  Believe me, (laughs) it does not work.  'Cause each one would move their stuff around.  And, you know, each cooked differently and all that kind of stuff.  It's one of my lifelong lessons.  Do not put three women in one kitchen.  I mean, they made it work but each time they would grumble, where's the spatula, where's the--this should be here and (laughs) all that kind of stuff.  And my mother was working and all the rest were retired.  So they had pension checks and stuff.  And they would become ill and over a period of years become sick and eventually pass away. but if you think about it, that put a tremendous strain on my mother's ability to have boyfriends and attract, you know, men  and stuff.  That were critical in her life.  In addition, you know, having had the burden of two kids.  One now off in the military, another one, I was I guess in high school at the time.  And then three elderly folks, it was amazing anybody came around (laughs) to see her.  'Cause this is a woman that had tremendous burden.  But she placed family first and other values, and it was clear.  And she took care of the folks and made sure that they were taken care of and looked after.  And the house worked and all that kind of stuff.  So, it was a very interesting environment.
Story_ID: 9549
Speaker 1: So when it came time to go to school you were--there was no decision about--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, there was a--When it came time for me to go to college, and at first it was clear I was going to college.  I had fantasies about going away to Hawaii or some place neat to school.  My father [Samuel Arthur Kaiser. Sr.] wanted me to come to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] or University of Chicago [Illinois].  Because they were, you know, chance to know him.  And they were cheaper because you could, you know, live at his home and so forth.  The key influence and factor is that I had met a young lady in my senior year of high school [John Marshall High School, Los Angeles, California].  She was actually a year or so ahead of me.  She was already going to Pepperdine University [Malibu, California]. And we'd become boyfriend-girlfriend and I was dating her.  And I decided that I was not going to leave home to go to college 'cause we had a romance going. So, I applied for and was accepted to UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles], which was a great benefit.  Because it was very inexpensive if you think about it this will shock you.  The tuition was $74 a semester.
Story_ID: 9550
Speaker 1: You were saying that it was seventy-four [dollars], you know, the tuition [at the University of California at Los Angeles].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The tuition was $74.  And we were upset because the parking was another $11 or $15, or something like that.  And during the couple of years later, in went up to $121. And so, we thought we were really getting robbed. But that was better than going to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] or University of Chicago [Illinois], which would have been much more expensive. And so, given the romance, I turned down [University of] Hawaii [Manoa].  Which would have been expensive.  Also to live, over, over in Hawaii.  And, Hawaii, at the time, wasn't accredited.  And then, that was a big important thing with my mother [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd], saying, "No, you got to go to a accredited school."  And so, I made a decision to live at home and go to University of California, Los Angeles, UCLA in which I did.  And I began as a major in political science.  And it--with the idea of becoming a lawyer. That was what I was going to become was a lawyer. And see, this is part of the models that you have in the community.  Because at that period of time, you could not go into Corporate America, there was no such career that was permitted. And so, there were professional careers.  Lawyers, doctors, there were entrepreneur careers, you know.  You could own a store or a business, insurance or something like that. Those were the models.  And or you could become a civil servant of some kind, postal worker, teaching.  Those were kind of what was open to African Americans, at the time. And I thought of myself as more of the professional type.  I didn't like medicine.  So it had to be law.
Speaker 1: Hmm. at--Even you were--You said yourself that you were better at math, than science.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, it was the opposite.  I like history and things like that.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh, you didn't say it. Okay, I miss that.  Okay I misunderstood.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so political science--They didn't have a pre-law degree.  So political science was the closest thing.  So I started out doing political science. And at the time, another key decision--we were engaged in the Vietnam conflict.  It was just heating up and everybody was beginning to get drafted. So, I decided to join ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps] and I chose the [U.S.] Navy ROTC. Only because my father's [Samuel Arthur Kaiser. Sr.] brothers had been in the Navy.  And I kind of saw the Navy, as being a more interesting world than the [U.S.] Air Force, where my brother [Samuel Arthur Kaiser Jr.] was in the Air Force. Since--So, I didn't want to walk in the Army (chuckles).  So I joined Navy ROTC.  As a way to defer or to make certain what my military obligation would be.  So I could finish school.
Speaker 1: And now, you say, you started out with political science, did you end of with political science? I mean, I know you--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) (chuckles) Yes. The answer is that I did end with political science.  But then, about two years into the mission, I decided that I wanted to look at business curriculum. And so, I switched over to business major and did about a year, year and a half of business.  And then, I ran into accounting. I was not very good at accounting for some reason.  I don't know why, to this day; lack of interest or whatever. And so, then I ended up switching back.  Which meant that I was able to squeeze a four year program, into five years. And then, graduated after five years at UCLA, instead of four.  Mainly because I lost so many credits in the major that I had.  You know, another major.  Going on that, I could have probably gotten a dual degree.  If I had gone one more year or something like that. So, hell.  The other key thing that happened that was critical is, I became disillusioned about what the university was supposed to do. That is, when I graduated from high school, I thought university really prepared you for life and what you were gonna do for your life and vocation. And, in fact, what happens is you get a bunch of general subjects, history, English and all those things, again. And then you begin a major which is interesting but it isn't specific enough to be actionable in in terms of a career. I mean they, political science you learned juris-, jurisprudence and you know, Anglo American legal systems and things like that.  But you don't really learn law. We had some tort law and contract law.  But--And I did very, very well in those courses.  I get straight A's and those things.  But it did not prepare you to be really a lawyer. And then, the other requirements I had to take bacteriology and stuff which I really detested. I, I remember one day sitting in class and the professor said, "Today, we are going to, to, you know, talk about the sex life of a mushroom!"  I said, "I can't take it!" Got up and walked out, (chuckles). I could care less (laughs) how mushrooms have sex.  And I really put a lot of energy into the ROTC thing.  I mean, it was one of the first kind of, right, well--I shouldn't say, the first because the sports were, were in school, I had sports.  But it was one of, one of the first signs of leadership. That I went on the drill team and became a kind of leading person on the drill team.  And ended up as head of the drill team. And, we were able to train people to march and so forth, and, and to win competitions.  And it was a place for me to demonstrate leadership. And, I should also add that one of the key things that happened there was, I did not pursue a football and so forth. I had the size, the speed.  I had played football in high school.  Had done very well there, had lettered and, and all that kind of--played both ways on first string.  But my mother had instilled in me that college is a place where get education.  Football was not an option. I mean she didn't want me to play because of injury. I'd been injured several times in high school.  But more importantly, it was not an outcome. I would, would--It would never was that I was (chuckles) going to play professional football.  That was not part of the curriculum.  So I'd did not play college ball. And, that is one of the things that I regret in, in life is that.  That if I wish I had played because I think I was good enough to play and do well and, I think it would have been a good influence.  Despite the fact that I would never have intended to play college ball.  It would have changed the way--and, and, I had thought about it, it would have changed the way I had looked at things.  Also, if I had played ball--but I had no intention of playing pro [professional] ball.  So when most of the people were playing ball--there was a way for them to exit their, you know living in the ghetto or whatever. And, they were really serious about ball and I was having fun, right? I was playing for fun. So, I played in football stuff and broke my thumb and all that kind of stuff.  But I did not choose to play on the varsity. And, instead, I put all that energy into drill team, and those kinds of things.  Where I did in fact, became a Squad Leader and the, the Chief Petty Officer of the whole thing and Commander of the whole thing. And we changed--there was a group of three or four of us that changed it from a mediocre drill team, to a championship team. And we won all our competitions and stuff, like that. But, it was different then, than playing football or doing something else.

Speaker 1: Now, just one curious thing, you said, that if you had played football it would have change how you view things. What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the experience of sports at that level and the discipline and the focus that sports teaches you.  Because it teaches you team focus and personal accomplishment, would have been good. I mean, the discipline of it would have been good.  I been, perhaps I would have done better in school [at University of California at Los Angeles] if I had a coach, who said, "You will do better in school, right? You can't afford--(chuckles)," because I would, I had I took a very dangerous habit--classes I did not like, I would go to until the first exam.  And I would take the exam, usually get a B or something like that.  Then I would skip class for the rest of the semester and read the book.  And I would get a real intellectual high on seeing if I could read the book and pass the course without having to attend the classes.  And so, I ended up--Some I got Bs, some I got Ds.  I never flunked.  But, but that gave me a pretty miserable grade average and the lack of focus there.  And it was strictly because I was disillusioned.  That I said, "You know, you're coming here really to prepare for your life.  When in fact, it's another intermediate step." And that hit me about the second year.  And I said, well, you know, I hate bacteriology.  I don't like sociology which were all electives and philosophy that I had to take.  To, you know, I mean the things I wrote a paper on painting ships gray, and what would happen if you painted them blue, in philosophy.  Got an A on the paper but it was such a ridiculous subject, (laughs) that I said, "This is absolute BS.  I don't know why I am doing this!"  We even had a thing in psychology class where we had to do a project and we had to do it in a team.  And it was very interesting.  It was team dynamics. And, we ended up deciding to do no project.  And to study the class' reaction to us having done no work.  Which was another ingenious, devious thing, right? (chuckles).  And we got an A on the project.  Because we, we actually got up and presented nothing.  And anticipated how the class would react and the teacher gave us an A, if you can imagine that. If I were teacher, I would never do that, but (laughs) anyway.  I mean, that was the level of using your wits to beat the system.  That actually was a sign of immaturity.  If, I look back at it, that if I had the discipline of sports or something, the coach would have called me on it, say, "Hey, you can't do this and be, be part of our program."
Speaker 1: And, you don't think the ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps] gave you some sense of--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, it, it did not.  the ROTC gave me great focus and--But it was driven by self, rather than, you know, instructors and stuff. And, we were there every morning at 6:30, 7:00 training, marching in the morning.  Firing blanks.  And, and as I said, I had a leadership role where we--People that would join the drill team were people, who could not excel in other things, like sports typically. And so, they had a great need to belong, and to be seen in an elite unit. And so, they, they were lot, many of them were poor coordination and so forth.  And we took them and made them legitimate almost, is the way to think about it. And, and taught them how to be winners. I mean, you know, things sports, these folks were not coordinated and all that, and they wanted to be part of a winning team. And we did that with a small group of people.  And got invited to Washington [D.C.], to the Cherry Blossom Festival.  And things like that, that were honors in that category. But I spend all my excess time designing maneuvers, you know, silent maneuvers.  That went out and came back together.  And we stood eighth drill team in Washington.  That used to throw rifles, four people back.  We did all those things. And spun rifles and threw them in the air. I still have scars where I got hit with the rifles. And, we use to break, I don't know, fifteen, twenty stocks a year.  You know, throwing them up and missing, watch the rifle being broken--drill sergeant (chuckles) wasn't very happy about that.  But we became very, very good at doing that as a team. And, I said, there's probably three to four people who put their energy into it and made all these things happened. And kind of, you know, the school and team got recognized for it in that category. I also participated on the [U.S.] Navy Rifle Team. I got actually a varsity letter in that.  But I ended up having to quit because I broke my thumb playing football.  And you can't shoot with, you know, your hand in a cast.  So I could not play that.
Story_ID: 9552
Speaker 1: So now, when it comes time to graduate, where are you at, at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm--You know, I ended up switching back and forth deciding I needed to get out. And going back to political science.  I graduated [from University of California at Los Angeles] after five years. And that put me automatically as an ensign in the United States Navy and I went off to war. I graduated and ten days later I was on a destroyer in Hawaii going to Vietnam. And that was a critical point in my life.  It turns out that I--that was the beginning of what I call real life. 'Cause now you're out of school.  This is, you know, for real and you're earning money.  You're (chuckles) actually going to war.  I mean that was a profound thing, you could be killed.  That kind of thing. So and I had a girlfriend.  That we'd been dating for five years.  Actually six years, I guess by then. Who--You know, so you're leaving somebody behind.  And have a very intense relationship. And that time I was planning to marry her.  I mean we had kind of plotted--that at least, I had plotted that, that we would get married when I got out of the Navy.  That was the plan. 'Cause I didn't want to be married, going overseas and back and forth. So, so, I was, you know, beginning my adult life.  That's the way I thought about it. And so, I made a decision to excel in my life, that whatever I would do, I would do whatever it took to win. And it was interesting.  The reason I know that was a critical point is later in my career, probably 1990, give you some my time frame.  When I worked for Corning [Incorporated] that had a study from the Center Of Creative Leadership, they had all their top managers go through this study where they kind of studied your life and interviewed your parents and you're--the people who worked for you.  Your peers and your superiors did this 360 feedback process.  And they could see a difference of a person, who was, you know, cutting class skipping (chuckles) exams kind of focus selfishly on what he wanted to do rather than meet the requirements of the system. All of a sudden, when I went into the Navy, you know, top and in the ASW [Anti-Submarine Warfare] Class, I came in the number two in the ASW Class. Number one officer on the ship.  You know, all--What's the change in behavior?  All of a sudden this guy is kind of skating by, is now excelling, and that was traced back to conscious decision to say, Okay, now we're playing for real.  This is no longer a test. You can't get by with skating around anymore.  You need to really focus and, and show what you're made of.  So I began to do that in the Navy. And decided that I was going to you know, really excel.  And I did.  I began to have achievements.  I was an officer of on deck on a destroyer as an ensign.  That beat out three lieutenant JGs [junior grade] that were senior to me, who should have had that spot. I was the fourth.  They have three lieutenants that run the departments on a ship.  Then, they have a fourth watch section.  They need four watch sections.  And typically that's lieutenant JG.  That's the outstanding.  And they bypassed all the lieutenants JGs and took a black ensign and made him the fourth watch officer.  Which is a big, big deal. Because they outranked me, you know rank wise in terms of the structure.  And there were other ensigns that were there and I beat out all lieutenant JGs. And they resented it quite a bit.  That, I had made the fourth watch section.  But I was really good at it.  And you know, had very strong leadership qualities.  And, and no-nonsense type of guy at the time.  And so I became the fourth duty officer. And had perfect fitness reports in the Navy.  I never seen that before.  A person whose is rated as perfect (chuckles).  And I think it was done on me. On their--I think, I don't believe I was perfect.  But I think it was done because the Navy was desperate to have black officers, and they wanted me very badly to succeed.  So not only, you know, was I excelling but in an environment that was receptive to me trying to excel.  So--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And what years were these?
Speaker 2: This is 1966 to '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you serve two years?
Speaker 2: Two years of active duty.  I was due to serve another three years active reserve. But I was fortunate enough that when I went back my (chuckles) reserve unit was full.  And, so they said, "Go home and we'll call you." And it's been thirty years.  And I'm (chuckles) still waiting by the phone, right? (laughs) My uniform doesn't fit anymore.  But I'm still waiting.
Story_ID: 9553
Speaker 1: You don't get married at this point?  So--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Nope.  I'm still single.  I'm experiencing [the Vietnam] war and the seriousness of, you know, life and death.  I mean you can't see in the [U.S.] Navy like you can in the [U.S.] Army, somebody who's killed right in front of you, or, you know, blood and all that. But, you see we were in the Gulf of Tonkin with the aircraft carriers, and you see flights of airplanes go out and come back with people missing and hear it on the radio that, you know, the flights down by three people or whatever.  Or you see aircraft that, that are shot up that land right in front of you.  I mean, that fly right over your ship and land. You know, fifteen hundred yards ahead of you on a deck of a carrier. So--And you get an experience in the military of, you know, working with real people.  Leading real people, managing real people in this military environment, and not the brightest and the strongest of people in many cases.  I had a very bright unit because I had Anti-Submarine Warfare.  But for a while I had what they call the deck crew, which is the not-so-smart folks--least technically smart, and they were hoods and, you know, people in and out of jail.  And I had a lot of very real life experiences. Like telling people their mothers had committed suicide or had been killed by a train, run over and hit in a car by a train or--one guy's brother murdered his father and I had to deliver the news.  So those are very powerful forming, experiences.  People experiences that I think are critical, to how you think about and deal with, with people over time. And, I was very good at it.  I mean, I excelled at that. And a lot of interesting  surprises.  That guy whose brother murdered his father. I was, you know, really torn up to have to tell him this.  And, I'd told him.  His mother, had died and, that his brother, or, or his father rather had died and his brother had killed him.  And he said, "Oh, well I kind of expected that.  Because the last time we were there, we said between the two brothers if he ever hits our mother again, one of us is going to kill him.  And who's ever home is gonna do it." That's what he told me.  "So, I'm glad I wasn't home to have to kill him."  And I was sitting here, worried about this (chuckles) big emotional thing, and I mean I was shocked.  That I was.  Totally shocked (laughs) by this experience. But it was, it was it was a very rich people experience and growing experience for me.  About people and working with people.  I was popular on the ship.  I was good at what I did. I could drive the ship very, very well. And I had the chance for the responsibility. And I was very, very tempted to stay in. And actually that led to another key decision in my life.  Because on the ship when I was getting close to the time when I was going to get out, I'd become Lieutenant JG [junior grade], had six months to go. The captain called me in one morning and said "We want you to become, you know, ship over.  And I would get you any assignment you want." And I had anticipated getting married.  So I said, "I want shore duty in Europe." And, he said, "That's impossible.  You know, ensigns or lieutenant JGs first round never get shore duty in Europe." And I said, "Well, if you want me to stay in the Navy, I want to get married.  And my view of marriage is not being at sea five days a week coming home on the weekend and then you deployed for six months and wouldn't see your wife and all that kind of stuff."  So he actually got a billet in Spain and a billet in Scotland.  Said, "Do whatever you"--Came back about three weeks later and said, "Do you want to go to Spain or Scotland"? I had a major decision to make.  And I say, "Well, if you stay in the Navy, the worst thing that you can do on your second rotation is go to shore duty.  You should go to a school to learn a new skill.  You should be at sea because that is what all your contemporaries are doing.  So if you're serious about a career in the Navy, this is the worst thing that you can do. And, if you're you know, really want go to Europe why don't you just take a vacation (chuckles) in Europe and be serious about your life, right? So I thought about it.  And the third thing is if I'm really as good as they say I am--they gave me Navy achievement medal that nobody had on the ship, and all that.  In addition to the Vietnam, you know, Vietnamese war medals and so forth.  So I had an extra row of ribbons most people didn't have.  If you're really as good as they say you are then you ought to bet on yourself that you'd do good in a corporate world, or someplace else rather than just stay in the Navy.  So I took that--the decision and told them, "No I will not accept your billets. I'm getting out," which made him mad. (laughs) 'Cause they had pulled strings and manipulated to give me this slot to keep me and then, I turned them down.  So I had kind of bad duty choices for the next six months.  I mean we were friends.  But all of a sudden I got the late watches.  And you know, I wasn't the favorite anymore. And got out of the Navy, got married [to Kathryn Mounday Kaiser] ten days later.  Took a thirty-day honeymoon in Europe.  So I went to Europe and then I took a job actually with Corning before I got off my honeymoon.  They called me up and said, "Would you please report." You know, had--I had like two days to go on the honeymoon.  "Can you cut it short and come to a training class? 'Cause we're hiring you to work for us." So that's what I did.  And I ended up starting with Corning [Incorporated].
Story_ID: 9554
Speaker 1: How many years were you at Corning [Incorporated]?
Speaker 2: Thirty.
Speaker 1: Thirty?  Thirty.
Speaker 2: Right.  While it was--It was interesting.  'Cause before, you know, when I decided to get out of the Navy, that I started an interview process with the different companies. They used to have what they call lineman weekends.  It was a provider--recruiter that came on military bases to recruit ex-officers. And one of those weekends, Corning was the first interview that I had. And, I walked into the booth and a guy said to me, "How would you like to sell a glass stove?" And, I couldn't conceive of what a glass stove was at that time. So, anyway, so I started working with Corning. They offered me a job selling in Los Angeles [California].  And I had asked to be in Los Angeles. They had jobs in the factories and so forth.  And Corning--New York and other locations.  But I had intended to get married.  And wanted to be in Los Angeles.  'Cause that was family and I had been away from home.  Although I was based in San Diego [California].  So I would go back and forth on the weekends and see my wife [Kathryn Mounday Kaiser] when I was not deployed.  We had two deployments to Vietnam and then, to six months.  And the rest of the time was in San Diego. So, I started working with Corning, as a salesman in Los Angeles for the major appliance department.  And I sold the product--The Counter That Cooks.  Which is a glass surface with electric heating element underneath the surface which is revolutionary at the time.  Because nobody had a top like that.  And, California was different than the rest of the markets because we didn't have a distributor who sold to retail in California.  So I actually sold to the retail stores and so forth, in Los Angeles. The Broadway department stores and appliance stores.  And I had a distributor in San Diego that I had a responsibility for.  Then ultimately I picked up a distributor in Hawaii.  So I used to go to Hawaii and sell there too.
Speaker 1: Now, so your career really at Corning was a large part in the beginning was sales?
Speaker 2: Well, for the large part.  I did that for two years.  And after two years I got promoted to go to the headquarters, in Corning, New York.  And I went back as a advertising and promotion guy.  Sales Promotion Specialist was the title. But I did all the use and care manuals, point of purchase displays, the, all the promotion type of work for the product.  Worked with the Ad Agency on the, you know, on making the ads and stuff like that.  I worked for, at the time, an advertising manager. But again as fate would have it I had a advertising manager who was really, really creative.  But not so good on management or the budgets. And when I reported for work after the first month he almost got fired because he missed his budget by a mere 10 percent.  Which took this new business that I was in, into the red, instead of the black.  His mis-forecast and so he came within inches of getting fired the second month that I was there. And so, his boss came to me and said, "He may be your boss but you are going to manage his budget and you will control all the finances, in this department and report to me for that."  So, (chuckles) it was a very awkward kind of situation.  Because my boss would go down the agency and hed--get dazzled about something, and commit to the agency to spend money.  And they would call me up before he got back there, to the home office and I'd tell them, "He cannot afford to get it."  Right?  "He doesn't have any money so don't do that." Then I had to go in and explain to them--my boss why he couldn't do what he committed to do (chuckles) with the agency. But I had that kind of unique role and they trusted me enough to do that. And I was clever enough to not get myself in any personal trouble with him.  But as being the bearer to his life, as opposed to being somebody that was saving him from getting fired. (laughs) So, it was a very interesting relationship.  Very, very creative guy.  One of the nicest guys you ever would meet.  But didn't have the discipline to, to manage the money.  And I used to take a spreadsheet and forecast every account, every month for every dollar to be sure that we made the budget.  Because it was life or death. It was clear to me so I use to every run a brochure, use and care manuals.  You know, any kind of spending, trips, everything forecasted every month to be sure that we would not miss.  And we didn't miss.
Speaker 1: So do you think at that point you were sort of pinpointed for, you know, for rising in the corporation?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I should go back and tell you that when I was hired with Corning I think there was one other management type employee, African American that was with the company. Only, maybe two, I can think of two a guy named, Don Clayter and another guy named Ken.  I can't remember Ken's last name.  In fact Ken interviewed me. So anyway Ken and Don were the two African American employees that I knew about in the company.  But I can't remember anybody else that was kind of like the very first generation.  And Ken was in, in Human Resources to hire African Americans and Don was a computer guy. And they hired a generation of African Americans in 1968.  I think there were five of us, which were the first five.  You know, kind of management potential people that came into the company. So in 1970, when I got promoted, I'm sure we were very visible.  In fact in 1969, I came to Chicago [Illinois] to a Kitchen Dealer show.  Cause we were in the appliance business and custom appliances. And they sent out a, a person from the Human Resources, to ask about how to recruit and how to better access African Americans inside the corporation.  And how to get more people in and how, what should we be doing to recruit.  So it was the beginning of their efforts to trying get, you know, get people into the company.  And I would give my advice and so forth. So, I think I was very, visible at--to say the least.  And on a track that if my potential would lead me there, that they would promote me. So, I went back to Corning, and, moved from the family home which was really interesting.
Story_ID: 9555
Speaker 1: So I should go back and tell you about what was going on with the family.  While I was--I guess at the last year of high school [John Marshall High School, Los Angeles, California].  My mother [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd] did succeed in finding someone and falling in love and remarrying.  So, I had a stepfather [Reginald Francis Floyd] that moved into the, to this (chuckles) environment with all the women and so forth. He was a Sergeant Detective Homicide, at the Los Angeles Police Department. So and then, you know, I kind of went away to [the Vietnam] war and all that kind of stuff. Came back got married and actually lived at home for about three months before we got an apartment.  And then, worked two years in Los Angeles with my wife [Kathryn Mounday Kaiser]. She was teaching school, actually making more money than I was initially because she had a head start. And we were wealthy, at the time.  Because both she and I were working.  We had no debt except for the honeymoon which we spent a lot of money on.  Had company cars and I had a car paid for so it was one of the most wealthy times of our lives. And then, all of a sudden I get promoted to go to Corning, New York, lost my company car, she quit working and essentially I am the--back in debt, right?  Or lose half my income, half my disposable income and moved to a cold climate where you need new clothes, and every kind of thing.  So it was a major financial setback even though it was a promotion. And then, what happened is just before I moved back or took that promotion, my stepfather had a heart attack and died. So, my mother all of a sudden, after having had my grandmother [Jane Ann Gordon] die off and my grandfather [James Edgar Gordon] and great-aunt, finally along with her, her husband they--probably had a year together, he has a heart attack and dies.  And I jump up and moved to, to Corning, New York.  So it was a very difficult family time, in terms of deciding if, whether I should do that or not. But again, the value was, "You need to do what you need to do to get ahead and this is what your destiny is.  Don't worry about me, my other son [Samuel Arthur Kaiser, Jr.] lives here in town."  Although something like a month or so later, he got transferred to, to Mobile, Alabama. So, all of a sudden from, you know, full house, everything, she moved out of the house into an apartment.  So a lot of transition going on. But back to, to the career in Corning. So, I moved back to Corning, New York, my wife quit teaching.  She had a very promising career in L.A. City School District.  And in fact, she had been named an Assistant Girls' Vice Principal, in the school system.  So they saw her in a leadership role. She was acting, you know, actually functioning as a Vice Principal, in, in the schools in the absence of other people. You know, suspending people, discipline, parent issues, and all that kind of stuff, which put her in a key spot. She was also on the key committees for--She's an art teacher for art in the L.A. City School System. So she was known downtown with you know, key people.  And so she was on the move. So it was a major career decision as to whose career we were going to follow because we had a dual career thing going on. And we decided to follow my career and begin to have children and things like that.  And the deal was she could retire and never have to work again, if she made the move. And so, economically it (chuckles) was a big switch.  Climate, moving away from all your friends and family in Los Angeles to this isolated town in upstate New York.  Lot of things going on.  The whole family thing with your mother living alone and, brother leaving and all that kind of stuff.  What's going to happen?  But we ended up making the move.  And I started working as an Advertising and Promotion Specialist.  And began to, you know, be able to do promotions and things and kind of show what I could do in an individual way with the top management of my operating group watching that. So, so that's what, what happened in New York, at least that got us there.
Story_ID: 9556
Speaker 1: Can you chart the rest of your career there, you know, within Corning [Incorporated], you know, the different jobs you had?
Speaker 2: Well two or three key things happened after about a year, year or so of that job. I looked around and saw that the high performance people in Corning were all Harvard [University], Princeton [University], Columbia [University] graduates.  The competition. And I'm a UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles] major with a perfect C average, you know, going, coming into the thing.  And I should take a step back 'cause there's a critical decision I missed. When I'd decided to get out of the Navy I was going to become a lawyer. And I went to go to apply to law school and the first thing they asked, is we only take people with B averages, right? I had this wonderful C average because I was screwing around with all the, you know, classes and not going to school, and kind of betting on how smart I could be to take the test. So, what it meant is I could not get into Stanford [University], or Harvard, or someplace where if you go to that school and are successful graduating your career is kind of set. But, I did get into Loyola [University] and a couple of other schools.  I think Loyola was the best, which is not bad.  But it wasn't one of the key schools. So I made a decision not to pursue law.  'Cause I had set myself up poorly to win.  Which, when, and that is what led me to begin to interview with different companies instead of going back to school.  Plus I wanted to get married and you had to do three years of law school which means you starved for three years and all that kind of stuff.  And I thought it would make sense to make some money.  So that's why I did that. So, now we go to Corning and I'm in an environment where I see the competition's all got master's degrees and MBAs [Master of Business Administration] and things like that. So it occurs to me that I really need to go back to school.  If I'm going to be competitive and at least get a master's degree. So the University of Syracuse had a master's program in Corning [New York] that you could attend.  It was an extension type thing. So, I went up there, a cute little story.  And they told me, "Well, you know, you got a C average and we take only B averages in our program. And this is going to be, you know, very difficult.  It will be hard for you to score well. Because, you know, you're probably not suited.  But we're gonna give you a break and let you get in the program." So they put me in the program.  I took a contract law course, which I knew I would do well at. And I got a straight As in the course.  I mean it was a perfect score.  But in the meantime, Corning came to me and said, "Gee, you're showing an interest in school.  We see you as a high performance guy.  How would you like to go to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] this Sloan Fellows Program [in Innovation and Global Leadership]?" Right? "Why mess around with this extension course, we'll put you in one of the best programs in the country." And I actually said to them, I said, "I don't think I can qualify for the program because I have a C undergraduate average." And they said, "You don't understand.  You know, when we send you up there, it doesn't matter whether you flunked out (chuckles) of school.  Once we send you, you're in." And so I applied for and was accepted into this Sloan Fellows Program at MIT which is one of the top MBA programs in the country. So, anyway to make the--complete the story, at the end of the semester at the Corning extension thing, I go back into the guy.  And he says, "Well, congratulations, you got an A, in this course.  This is real promise.  If you can do that again, you know, get a B or better in the next semester's course, we'll let you stay in the program." And I said, "Well I've decided to quit." And he said, "Well, I wouldn't get--Don't be discouraged.  You know, you really, you--This is good progress." And I said, "No, no I'm going to MIT!" (laughs).  And, he almost fell off of his chair. And I said, "I'm accepted in this Sloan Fellows Program.  So I don't have time to go next year.  I won't be here." So then I moved to Boston.  Kathy [Kathryn Mounday Kaiser] and I moved up to Boston.  Started the Sloan Fellows Program, a very critical test for myself.  And something I had to prove to myself also. The test and that these are very, very competitive folks that are in this program.  Because they're all selected as high performance folks from their company. Most of them are about to become officer of the company, Vice President. I was the youngest in the program at age thirty-one.  Most people were in their forties.  Most people were making quite a bit more money than I was and they, therefore lived in a different part of town, and so forth. And I had to live in an apartment that was more along my means and capabilities.  And, I, as a result of that Corning actually put me on expenses.  So they paid for my tuition, paid for me to move up there, and put me on an expense account while I went to school which is a great way to go to school.  By the way, it's the only way, if you can do it. But I entered into the Sloan Program and did very well there.  I got one B out of the whole thing, all A's.  And I had to prove that to myself that I really wasn't a dummy in school.  I was just not motivated, so.  And the B I got, I missed by one question.  The difference between an A and a B or straight A's and one B was one question on one test, (chuckles).  That's how close it was.  But anyway, so one year, while we were at the Sloan Program, our daughter [Lauren Elizabeth Kaiser] was born.  And that was real interesting because we were having trouble having children. And that--we were talking about adoption and all that kind of stuff.  And for some reason during the Sloan Program, Kathy was able to get pregnant. I think it was from the amount of pressure that was in the program so that your focus was off of trying to have children and trying to get grades.  'Cause I had never worked so hard in my life.  I used to work from 9:00 to midnight, every day, 9:00 a.m. to midnight in that program, just to succeed.  Again, you know, playing life to win, right?  And then so we--Lauren was born in April, graduated in June.  A really defining experience in the program.  Because it introduces you to Senior Corporate Executives, CEOs [chief executive officer].  Where you spend a lot of time kind of--in small groups talking with CEOs. And with this competitive group of people, it taught me that I could compete and succeed with anyone. In fact, in economics, which is not an area of strength for me, in the first test, I had the top score in the class.  Which blew everybody away.  'Cause they just couldn't believe a black guy could do that. We were the--in terms of pioneering there was--I was told one black person was in the program the year before us.  And the group--There were three or four of us in this program.  One, two, well two--I was the third American.  And then we had an African--Algerian actually, guy.  So that was the second group of African Americans in this Sloan Fellows Program. And--And to have one of us beat out of all of them was a major, you know, like, "What in the world is going on? Particularly the kid, right?" The thirty-one year old (laughs) who's a salesman, Promotional Specialist.  And all these other guys are directors, and, you know, about to be anointed as folks on the way to being CEO and so forth. And it was a major, major shock.  And we worked in car pools and lot of interesting things there.

Speaker 1: So then, back to my career.  I came back, moved four levels in the company. I guess it would actually be considered five levels, to become the Brand Manager for Corningware.  Which at the time, was the largest brand in the company. Did that for two years.  Then I was promoted to a job that was the strategy job for defining consumer products strategy on a worldwide basis.  So, I worked on projects in Japan, defining a relationship for our consumer business.  We had joint venture in Japan between Asahi Glass [Company, Ltd.] and Corning [Incorporated].  And they had a consumer business that wasn't working well.  So I had to redefine the business and tell them how to run their business. I did strategy studies in the U.S. One in Europe, which led me to my next job. Where I  was asked to go to be the consumer guy for southern Europe. I had sales marketing technically.  Not the factory but my boss was the European General Manager and he lived in France.  And he didn't want to appear to be the French guy so he gave me the plant even though it wasn't in titles. So effectively, I had southern Europe to run for consumer products, which was Italy, Spain, France and Belgium. Did that for two and a half years. Came back and had a lot of experiences speaking French, living overseas, we could talk about. Came back and went into the laboratory to run a marketing team on the technical side of the company. So, I left Consumer Products which is another defining thing in my career, and went to the technical side. The reason for that is while I was doing the strategy job, I created a model for how you could bring market, new technologies to, from the lab to the market place.  When I came back, they said, "Why don't you go do that.  'Cause we need that to happen for technical types of products, not consumer products." So I actually headed up about an eight-person team of senior marketing people working with the laboratory folks.  And what I would define, is the most difficult form of marketing.  Where you conceive of a product, define the market, all the specifications, bill the customer and then develop it with the customer. So I did that for a couple of years, got promoted again, to running a major business called the Materials Business.  Which was a collection of electronic and industrial products from Specialty Glass [Specialty Building Products].  And went into electronic industrial and lighting applications. It was about a hundred million dollar business at the time, and about fifty thousand products--very, very complex difficult business. And--Cause there's all these little product lines that you have to manage. And so, I had that business, about a hundred people, something like that, a hundred million in sales. Then, I got promoted to be an officer of the company and run a division which was called the Technical Products Division.  It had this material business and ophthalmic lens bank business and a military business.  They added to it a sunglass business, a liquid cry--Cause I built the sunglass business, liquid crystal display business, and a memory disk business. Then they gave me export geographic area for Latin America, Asia Pacific, in addition to those businesses in five plants. They gave me a geographic area.  It was called Latin America-Asia Pacifics.  For all the exports that the major divisions where they didn't have an overseas person. So I think the consumer had their stuff overseas and optical fibers.  But  all the other divisions--So I had all the products from the company in exports. So I had people in Seoul and Hong Kong and the Philippines and Singapore and all that kind of stuff.  So I used to travel all that area. So I had that, the domestic division.  And the last responsibility was what they called worldwide businesses.  Where for the main businesses I had in the U.S., we had a worldwide coordination responsibility where you manage those businesses on a worldwide basis. For example, ophthalmic, we manufactured in Brazil and France and in the U.S. and sold all over the world. So I had Japanese guy that came into me and an European guy and we would integrate the businesses, the strategy the resources, the capacity and all that kind of stuff.  Customer strategies on a worldwide basis for the worldwide businesses.  And there were three or four of those. Then I did that job for--from 1984 to 1992. And then, I had--in 1991, I had a major defining thing happen in my life.  I got passed over for promotion, in Corning. And what happened was one of my peers, actually two of my peers got promoted.  And it was real interesting.  Because I had the best operating results, the best morale measured by climate surveys and so forth.  We had world class--actually close to the best.  The optical fibers business might have been as good.  But customer surveys and so forth, our relationships with customers were deemed to be world class by external measurements, not by our measurement. So--And we had the best quality program in the company. So by all the measures that you are supposed to succeed, growth, profitability, innovation, quality, morale, all those things.  Our division was the best.  But I didn't get promoted. So it was a very interesting series of conversations.  Because I went to my boss who got promoted.  And he took two other people along with him. And his explanation was, he went to the window and looked out the window and said, "I wish it could be different." That's all he ever really told me (chuckles).  He said, "I wish it could be different." I said, "Well is there, you know, if it's based on results, is there something I'm missing?" Cause I was rated outstanding by his performance ratings. He said, "No." I said, "Is there somebody who is really pissed off at me?  You know, is there--have I made enemies someplace?" "No."  You know, then I said, "Why have I not got promoted?" And he said, "Well essentially I wish it could be different." I mean that was as good an explanation as I got.  He asked me to speak to a guy who was a kind of consultant for out-placement.  He wasn't trying to out-place me.  But, this is a guy that when he had been passed over once he'd spent some time with. He said, "Well, I suggest you go talk to this guy." I went and talked to this guy, who was connected in the company.  Because he managed all the outplacement stuff.  He knew the chairman, Aaron. So, he went around and asked the chairman and the key managers, "Why didn't Jim get promoted?  'Cause by all the criteria that you specify he wins!" And the answers he got back is, "Well, Jims already got a good job." (chuckles).  "He already has a really neat job and he's very successful. What more could he want?" type of questions, right? So I think the answer is they had never planned for me to do that well.  And I was never in the running.  And so when they got to who was going to make it, I just didn't get on the list. Which was a source of very, very high frustration to me.  So my boss, who was my mentor, and who succeeded, he's now chairman of the company, said to me, " I want you to work for your peer and, you know, really help him get established." And I said, "Okay, I'll do that.  But a year from now you've gotta tell me what's going to happen with me." So, I put my head down and, you know, I just kind of sucked in and worked as hard as I could.  Actually that year I had one of the best years I've ever had.  Max my bonus out--I had made out of seven years.  At that time, I had made my number six out of seven years, right? Hit the budget and target, so forth. Everybody used to believe I couldn't miss budget.  It was that bad. And we had pulled some miracles to get, you know, performers to work.  And I had very, very strong people relationships.  So, a very close-knit team.  My division was the division people tried to get into because it was growing and exciting and that kind of stuff.  From the sleepy division I'd inherited. And after that year I went to my boss and said, "Okay, I've done another year, I maxed out my bonus.  You know, what are you going to do for me? I've been here eight years, same job.  I've been promoted from Vice President to Senior Vice President." And, he said, "Well, I don't have anything for you." And I said, "Play me or trade me, cause I don't want to stay here in limbo." I said, "I can't do this job another eight years.  I mean, I got, you know, fifty what--fifty years old.  So I'm going to do another five years in the same job?" I said, "The only place I have to go is down.  Cause you can't do better than I've done in this job. So all I can do is lose.  And I need to either leave or--" So they came back and said, "Well, we've got this great company subsidiary.  We want you to be CEO [chief executive officer] of this subsidiary." And so I looked at the company.  It was broken.  It was a job outside of Corning.  And I said, "I turn the job down.  This is a bad, bad deal for me." And he said to me, "Well, I've already told the chairman, you are going to go take this job." (chuckles).  And I said, "You know, I want you to go see him.  'Cause you know, this is critical." So I walked up to the chairman's office.  And he says, "Why aren't you on your way to this job?" And I said, "Because I can't tell where it's in my interest to take it." And he said, "Well, what is it that you want, to take this job?" So I said, "Oh, so it's going to be like that so, I named a whole bunch of things.  I want this, that, this. And he said, "You got it." So essentially they were trying to move me out of Corning because I was an embarrassment.  Because they could not explain. All the white managers were saying, "You said, if you do these things you win! Here's a guy that does it,. He didn't win.  Why didn't he win? And these other guys who aren't as good, aren't as popular, haven't got as good results, they win! What's going on?" And so I was a big embarrassment for them.  So they sent me to Denver, to--Actually they let me choose where I could go. They said, "You can either do this in New Jersey, this job as CEO of the subsidiary.  Or you can put it in Denver." So I said, "This must be a trick question. Right? Do I go to Denver or New Jersey? Denver or New Jersey." So, I went to Denver and built the company there.  And, you know, the objective was to grow the company dramatically. So, first, it was losing money.  It was a company that had been acquired. There were four distinct business segments that had never been integrated.  So, they were all fighting with each other, and so forth.  So I mean a lot of problems. So, anyway I decided to go ahead and take the job. Pulled all the segments together, got it to be profitable.
Story_ID: 9558
Speaker 1: Okay, that we're going to give you this company.  You know, that you go up to see the president [of Corning Incorporated]--.
Speaker 2: In Colorado--.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So okay.  So what, what happened is we decided to put the company [Enesco, Inc.] in Colorado. And as I said, it was a company that was not earning money.  It had been an acquired company, that were four competitors that were bought and put together, merged together.  And so, they 'd never been integrated as a business. And there was a lot of mistrust, and stuff, amongst the people.  Because they used to be competitors and so--And they use to steal each others' businesses. I mean the first meetings I had were extraordinary, where people hated each other. And, they all came to me, and said, "You know, I'm great but, you should fire him.  And this company is dishonest.  And we don't want to be associated with them." I mean this is the kind of company I ran. But over you know, over the next year, I was able to pull the company together, make it profitable, build a team out of those people.  And, convince Corning [Incorporated] that they should invest further in the business. And so we were actually looking to be--to acquire somebody to grow the company, which was the original strategy. So it was going very, very well. This is '93 [1993], okay and '94 [1994].  That kind of time frame.  At the same time, Corning ran into a small cash problem.  Because the segment of business--These other businesses that I was talking about, in blood testing and animal testing and the drug efficacy testing and all that kind of stuff, were growing dramatically. And so they were using a lot of cash.  And there were some business downturns in the other sectors. So there came to be a cash shortage.  So Corning decided to sell some businesses.  So they put our business up for sale. Which is a clue as to where we stood in the system.  So, at the same time, we were trying to acquire somebody, people were looking to acquire us.  Which will give you kind of a paranoid personality.  Because literally I would go to see a guy and his company and talk about acquiring them on Tuesday.  And Wednesday I'd be in an office with a Fortune 500 Company trying to acquire me. And that leads to a little bit of uncertainty amongst your team and all that, that understand that. But anyway, we were fortunate enough that that we convinced Corning to merge our company.  They didn't buy it, they decided to just merge it.  So people came with equal shares and formed a 50-50 joint venture.  Because we didn't have the cash to buy because we were a little bit cash short.  We merged with the number two player in the market which took the sales up to, about a hundred and fifty million dollars from eighty, eighty to ninety. And, and it was a major merger because they were another company that had been acquired.  You know, acquired different pieces.  So, we now had seven cultures to merge into one operating unit. And we did that in June of '94 [1994], I guess it was. And then, in the fall of '94 [1994], the Republican Congress came in and flattened the government's spending, as far as the eye can see.  If you remember those days.  They said, "We're not going to spend anymore increase in spending." And this was a major growth--You know, environmental cleanup was a major growth sector in that market. So, what happened was the market went flat.  That precipitated a price war amongst the vendors.  Prices went down 60 percent in two years. And so by the end of that year--I mean, that had been going on.  What happened was the company we had just merged and put together, we took 25 percent of it out in one day. Just fired 25 percent of the people, from the top, all the way to the bottom of the, of the company. And then and we were still losing money.  And then we took another 5 percent out in April.  And that stabilized the company. So we weren't losing money anymore.  But we weren't making money in this environment. And then we went--And this is a joint venture.  And our partner who was an environmental testing engineering company that had backward integrated into the lab business.  Now they got rid of the lab business for an engineering company.  They were also suffering. So they didn't have money to re--You know, to help the company grow, or rebuild the company. We were getting behind in our loans.  Cause we're breaking even and not paying down the debt. So Corning came and refinanced the company.  Took a greater share of the business, but they would not reinvest to grow.  Cause in that period of time is the time the number two competitor went bankrupt. Just to give you some feel.  The number three competitor was, you know, closing laboratories, firing half of its people.  I mean that's what was going on in the industry.  Which was the time to buy assets.  If you're gonna grow the business, you can buy all these assets cheaply. And they said, "Well, we don't want to do that.  We're gonna wait until the next election '96 [1996], to determine, you know, what we do. And see if we can just last out this business cycle." So in '95 [1995], I went to the company and said, "If you're just gonna hold on to it, you're not going to grow it.  This--I'm very expensive to have as an Operating Manager here.  I'm not interested in hanging around for two years doing nothing, making no money and watching the business die. I'm gonna exercise the options in my agreement. 'Cause when I left to take this kind of bad job, I had negotiated an agreement that I could exit on my terms, with all my handcuff shares and all that kind of stuff.  So I said, I'm going to exercise my options." And so we decided to--that I would retire. And I retired in--effectively in--Well I took a leave of absence until my thirtieth year.  So I would get full pension and everything.  And retired February--March 1, 1996. and decided to change the pace of my life.  'Cause I figured it would be better to do something that was more interesting rather than go back to Corning and, you know, be at the same level. I could have gone back to Corning to be Division Manager or whatever.  But that was kind of what I was before. And then I would have had a chance to get promoted in a kind of different round, probably a staff position.  But I said, "No, I think what I'm going to do is, is pursue the strategy I've always had.  Which was to retire at fifty-five, except I was fifty-three and just do that two years earlier. So I had stepped out of corporate--corporation with, you know, full, at full term with thirty years service and fifty-five years old. You could have gone longer.  But that's essentially full pension and everything. And changed my life and, then, then, you know, determined what else I wanted to do.  So I took about a year looking at different areas, what I wanted to--and devise a kind of a strategy for my life.
Story_ID: 9559
Speaker 1: So I started this process of trying to figure out what I wanted to do essentially for the second half of my life.  Okay.  And what I did is look at different kinds where I could be a--of service.  Because a fundamental decision that ultimately I wanted to give back to the community.  'Cause I have been very fortunate and made a little bit of money working for Corning [Incorporated]--stock had done nicely and so forth.  So I began to and I also had this desire to be an entrepreneur.  I did not want to go back into corporations having spent thirty years working for somebody I didn't want to go back just because I could have easily gone and run a division for somebody else or whatever.  That would have been the natural--easy. And I would have had a big income jump.  Because you get your pension and whatever you were earning before as an income jump.  So I decided now I'm gonna change my life and, and look at whether I want to go back and give service to the community or become an entrepreneur.  So I look at a whole bunch of interesting things superintendent of schools. I actually got offered a job as a superintendent of schools for a major district, assistant secretary for state or for the Navy.  I looked at two of those jobs, business school dean.  I looked at that.  Association kind of president.  And I ended up deciding that the smartest thing for me to do would be to,  to do what I had some economic interest.  Which was to kind of stabilize my existence.  'Cause I could have retired and, and lived off of what the, the income and welfare I had built from Corning.  But I would diminish my assets.  And I decided strategically that I was too young to begin to diminish assets.  So I had to earn enough money.  But I didn't burn, you know I didn't burn any assets.  So I essentially had to earn what I was earning with Corning or better. So I decided to become an entrepreneur.  I looked at manufacturing companies which is my background and strength.  Except the problem is you have to have too much capital to put into them to get a significant equity state.  And I didn't want to risk my retirement to do that.  I mean I could have put all my assets into capitol.  But then we'd be back on the block.  And if it fell, you would lose your retirement.  So I looked at smaller businesses.  And that meant franchising as the safest way to go into smaller business.  So then I looked at different franchises.  And through Skyler (ph.), who we talked about, or Capital, they happened to have money from Toyota in their fund.  Asked me if I would be interested in being a, a car dealer.  And so to make a long story short, after an examination of that for about a year and a half, we had the opportunity to by a Lexus dealership in Memphis.  So I bought 51 percent interest in that.  I have a partner who owns 49 [percent].  He runs the business.  I draw a salary from that.  That essentially replaces my salary at Corning.  The pension replaces my bonus.  And so between that and the boards and so forth, that gives me the economic stability.  And I'm working essentially one week in Memphis a month, instead of four weeks for Corning a month.  And that allows me time to do other, other kinds of things and so forth.  So ultimately I want to build a base of several dealerships to get the economic peace that I need.  And then I can take money and give back into projects.  And maybe have enough time to actually take a role like a business school dean or something where money would be no object.  And you could keep your asset base and pass that on to future generations.  'Cause that was kind of the goals that I set for myself.  I wrote a strategy around four different segments of, of my life.  One, giving back where I want to have a foundation that does projects and so forth.  And send some through that kind of a consulting business where I share my knowledge and skill, sets management quality, innovation, all those kinds of things.  An entrepreneurial section enterprise, as I call it, that does businesses.  And then what I call holdings, which is where the assets are in stocks and homes and so forth.  And so I have this four kind of division strategy that I euphemistically call my wife [Kathryn Mounday Kaiser] and myself the Kaiser Group.  Which is why the e-mail address is at.  And it has these four divisions.  And that's kind of the strategy that I operate my life on.  And each of those strategies has opportunities connected with it.
Story_ID: 9560
Speaker 1: So when you talk about where--where do I go from here, what am I trying to accomplish?  The core of the strategy is to make a difference.  Make a difference, number one, to my family and to help my family get set up and so forth.  That's my daughter [Lauren Elizabeth Kaiser] and so forth and economically.  One of the reasons I don't want to burn the assets is to make a difference in how the family lives for several generations.  By creating enough wealth.  But more importantly, to make a difference to the community, by giving back to the community.  And so the entrepreneurism is really to stabilize myself economically.  And to create a base to be able to do projects and, and things from scholarships.  And to support different kinds of directions, programs, directions or whatever in the community.  And to share the, essentially is to share the income, wealth, knowledge, skills, capabilities that I have learned in thirty-odd years back with the community in some form or another.  So I work on different projects from time to time, to help do that.  For example last year we had a friend--actually two years ago now passed away.  A friend passed away and we decided to create a scholarship in his name.  And I was able to raise $150,000 dollars to do that, and set it up with Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Where we have two full-time students there on scholarship as a result, result of that.  That's simply something I just did you know on the phone with some friends and try to make that happen.  I mean it's that kind of thing that ultimately I want to do.  And, and lend my skills back--I mean I came very close to taking a job as superintendent of schools because I thought I could make a major contribution there.  It would have been an awful environment and a very risky type thing.  But I looked at--did a business plan for it and then decided this was the wrong timing and fit for me right now.  But it would be the kind of thing I would be interested in doing, you know, like three or four years from now.  It would be fun to do something like that.  So I mean that's ultimately what I want to do, is give back.  I have a number of visions and dreams of things that could happen. One of them is happening through the Executive Leadership Council.  Where I had an idea about using a Baldrige-like process to measure companies and diversity.  Where they've actually created a diversity instrument to do that.  That's a national, a nationally recognizable tool.  Where companies can measure their progress against diversity, just as the Baldrige processes does against quality.  And I can see a vision of taking that further.  And having an institute that is a non-profit organization that measure show people are doing and becomes proactive in doing it.  For example that's one program.  Another program is a vision around scholarship programs.  By giving students who will win an extraordinary capability versus their competition by giving them every advantage that you could have in your career.  What I call executive leadership scholars' program, where if you took all the enriching experiences, outward bound experiences, [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] Sloan [Fellows Program in Innovation and Global Leadership]-type experiences and giving those to people early in their career to build their confidence and knowledge base and so forth.  You could almost insure success in corporations and in the process, teaching them to give back, and reach back, and pull people along.  I have a vision about how you could do that.  I mean a very specific program and, and vision.  In fact, we almost did it at one time with the Executive Leadership Council, when I was chairman of their foundation.  So, anyway there are a bunch of notions like that that are floating in my mind. That could help us do things even in the automobile business to bring entrepreneurs on board with capital and so forth.  We could--You could do some things there.
Story_ID: 9561
Speaker 1: Listening to you tell your story it's been interesting.  And it's different from what I anticipated.  You know, I did hear today--Mainly because, you know, all the articles talked, you know, becoming head of the--
Speaker 2: Enesco [Inc.].
Speaker 1: Enesco.  And it brings me back to a couple of things.  I, you know--I went to law school.  And, you know, here you sort of--You even had your rise in the Navy.  You had sort of a--once you had made a decision to do, you had made a decision to do--had the initiative to go forward.  And so my question to you is do you believe--What is your view of, you know, diversity or the ability of blacks to succeed in corporate America?  And what they have to do so?
Speaker 2: I hope you have five more tapes, right? (laughs) Well that's a very complex question.  I got a lot of feelings that are rum--rumbling around so let me kind of drift around between different feelings.  I don't know that there is a, a simple direct answer to it, first I think you know, there are people that have, that have risen and disappeared within corporations.  In fact the generation that I was a part of--There were articles and things that said "Gee he could be--He might be able to make--" And there were a group of us that were around that, that were part of that process.  I mean four or five of us, Barry Rand, and Ken Chenault.  I mean there were a bunch of folks that were, Manny Jackson was there, Jerry Williams here in Chicago [Illinois]. There were a number of people and those were just a few.  People who were qualified, capable, intelligent enough and skilled enough to run corporations.  And I was young among them when I was in that, in that grouping.  One of the things that strikes me the most is something when I mentioned the friend who passed away.  A guy named Al Martins, who was the founding president of the Executive Leadership Council and a very dynamic executive from Xerox.  He actually died at one of our meetings, just after he had given a few words, you know, a response to somebody.  And his response--his last words were, "You know, they just don't want us here." And then about fifteen seconds later he dropped dead.  Okay?  And that sticks in my mind as kind of a bottom line of the whole, whole sequence.  I think there are people who now are breaking through.  And there are CEOs [chief executive officers], legitimate CEOs.  Lloyd Ward of Maytag is, is one.  Ken Chenault is, is on his way to be head of American Express,.  Barry is, after being pushed out of Xerox, and Xerox essentially going in the tubes, landed at Avis when Xerox (chuckles) made a choice of a guy to supersede Barry that took the stock in half.  And Barry ended up the CEO of Avis.  But Barry is one of those people who had led Xerox for years and did a good job.  But--And there are a number of others.  Jerry Williams was the first guy on the cover of 'Fortune' as touted to be CEO.  And, and his boss came in and pushed him out two months later because he was on the cover of 'Fortune'.  So--And I know both of them.  So I mean it's, it's, you know--Al's words "They just don't want us here" has made it very difficult for people to break through.  'Cause the expectations--I mean it was just never in the plan.  But we're seeing some of those, those gains now.  There are certainly people who are qualified.  Who have experience, the skills to be at the tops of, of corporations.  Having sat on several boards now major boards, and seeing the level of leadership and so forth, I know that there are African Americans that are both qualified and could easily run corporations with the skill sets that I see people have.  But the opportunities are few and far between.  Because people just don't have that in the cards.  Now one of the things that's coming along that's very interesting is the whole dot-com revolution, and the impact on that.  And there are people who have suggested to me that the reason you are seeing break through in the Fortune 500, is because the growth and action and big bucks are now in the dot-coms.  And so the focus is changing to the new venue, and so, and these old bastions of, of power and so forth.  Not to say that they aren't still very powerful, that you're seeing people allowing some of that to happen.  Because  there's a new game in town which is dot-coms and all that and a new approach.  'Cause all those are closely held between friends and neighbors and stuff.  That, that you don't have the same accountability for diversity and all that the Fortune 500s have.  So to try and answer our question, I think it, it was never really in the game plan, first, the pyramid is very narrow.  And to give credit to the other side of the story very few majority folks make it to the top.  So you gotta--You have to start with that.  That the pyramid's very narrow.  Second, that the number of African Americans playing at that level is very few.  So statistically it's a remote possibility.  But the other thing I believe is that it wasn't in the plan for folks to make it in, into those kinds of jobs.  And you have to be more than exceptional.  Not just exceptional but more than exceptional to get on the consideration list to break through to those, those kinds of levels.  And I think you will see people doing that now.  That there's another game to play.  And over time statistically there's bound to be a few.  But, but there are still big gaps.  Diversity is not as critical in corporations today.  They've passed through that phase and are on to other things. And I think maybe we've peaked in terms of seeing where diversity goes.  And you'll see some statistical breakthroughs.  But, but that's it given that it's difficult to start with. Not everybody can do it and, and so forth. But I think the issues still exist strongly in Corporate America today.  That is systemic prejudice.  Not so much individual work prejudice, but systemic racism, I guess, is the way you would describe it.  If you think of prej-, prejudice being individual, discrimination being in groups, and racism being institutionalized, I think you, you'll still see institutional racism that still exists where, you know, the system just doesn't consider you.  And you still will see some breakthroughs and, and some successes.  But it's, it's hard out there.  And the younger generation is not even as sensitive as we were to it.  Because they think it's over.  And what has happened is it's a very different game these days.  It's very subtle and it's cloaked in different clothing.

Speaker 1: So with someone coming along, you know, young African American, what would you advise them?  Would you advise them, you know, if they were fresh out of business school to go through the business track, or would you advise them to go to a dot-com?  I mean you start thinking of their own dot-com?
Speaker 2: Well I would say a couple of things.  First, is the career I have had in corporate America with Corning was a rich one, it was full of wonderful experiences, and I have had a very good career.  I've made it within the top.  I would say seven to ten jobs within the company, was able to make some money tha-, that's a real nice opportunity, and those opportunities exist for folks.  The second thing I would say is, the second favorite statement I mention is, "God bless the child that's got his own."  Equity is the answer to, to the game.  I think corporations provide a magnificent training ground.  And for those who don't want to take the risk, you have the pluses and the minuses.  The pluses being the rich career you can have.  The minuses being that, you know, you've got to fight the system and, and all that kind of stuff, to be--to reach the top.  You don't have an equal chance to reach the top of those corporations.  But they provide a wonderful training ground.  That if you can learn, you know, business and the--really the practice of business And corporations, And then have your own company.  The guys who make tons of money are the ones who have taken the risk to have their own company.  And if that's what you're looking for, then I would encourage you to get a good foundation in corporations for marketing, for sales and the how-to's and the treachery of, you know, this kind of behavior, or that or this path, or that path.  And then look at your own opportunities.  That's what, essentially what I tell my daughter [Lauren Elizabeth Kaiser] is, "God bless the child that's got his own." And if you can learn from the companies you participate in, and then make your own choice, you may want to stay there and enjoy the career, given that this is the way it is.  Or you may want to diversify, and take a risk, and probably triple your income, and then go another way and have a different kind of impact.  Yeah, if you talk about corporations, I wouldn't describe the outlook as being dismal or bad.  It's just that to me it's restricted.  And if you choose a corporation it's not an open playing field per say to go all the way to the top.  I think that it's open at certain levels.  And it gets closed the higher you go up in a different way for minorities than it does for pe-, whites or majorities. I think it, it, it, it just gets closed in a different way.  It's more restrictive but there are still tremendous opportunities.  I have a wonderful career with Corning [Incorporated].  I don't regret my career with Corning.  I have lots of friends there.  The company has treated me very, very well.  I just never had, I don't think, a real shot at the top jobs.  And that's the restriction.  Now that's true for other people as well.  I mean white people don't all have shots at the top jobs either.  But I think it's different.  It's more restrictive for African Americans.  If you take the risk and become an entrepreneur, you can do what you're big and bad enough to do within the constraints that--White people will still be your customers and, you know, your suppliers.  I mean I, I get cars from Lexus. And they can decide that I shouldn't be a dealer.  And they have treated me wonderfully and I do very well with them.  But I have a less restriction about what I can make in money, and so forth, with them by the merits of my own performance, than I would in a corporate system, where there are other things than performance at work.  I guess that's the easiest way to say it. But I would never describe it as dismal, compared to what people are experiencing when you can't get a job at all, or don't have skills, or can't feed your family.  And, you know, don't have the opportunity to give your children educational advantages.  That's dismal.  Making a half-million bucks a year is not dismal.

Speaker 1: What would you say in terms of the, you know, advising someone who's younger in terms of how to succeed in, in, Corporate America?
Speaker 2: Well in any environment, the, the factors for success are the same.  I think you have to have a personal motivation and what I use to describe as, "I have made a decision I would try and win at every event, every single day.  Whenever I do anything, I try to win."  For example, last night we had dinner with customers.  I wanted them to come away saying, "Boy was this really great having dinner with the board member of this company.  He really was a contributor."  That's a personal desire, a personal energy to be successful.  I think you have to have a personal standard of, of success.  And there are lots of things in corporations that relate to, you know, making your boss look good.  And working as a team player, and those kinds of things that would be normal system types of things.  so you, you need to learn how to win every day.  How to win within your own system.  How  to fit within teams.  How to differentiate yourself there.  Whole series of, of things that are successful.  But also look at what that could mean to you if you were you know, in another--different environment.  If I look back on my career, I would probably have been better off in leveraging my position as leaving Corning after I'd been general manager for three years, perhaps. And jumped to another company with a handsome increase in another system, where I would have gotten a raise and, you know, come in as a star, and do that two or three times.  I--my generation didn't do as much of that.  The guys that I know from the Executive Leadership Council behind me are doing much more of that.  And my daughter [Lauren Elizabeth Kaiser] thinks that way. I mean the loyalty and so forth has changed over time.  It's part of the differences in generations.  I think, in my own case, going back, that's probably a mistake that I stayed in the job too long.  Because I thought I was winning.  And, in fact, I didn't have a chance to win.
Speaker 1: And your daughter.  You talked a lot, is she, is she pursuing--
Speaker 2: She is right now in a, in a corporation. She works for Quest Wireless [Quest Communications].  Used to be U.S. West as a marketing person.  And she is getting a fabulous experience and education within that company.  And seems to be doing very well for her, you know for her age.  She is very young, she's twenty-seven.  And she is in a managerial level that will make a lot more money than I use to make at that age, with a lot of insight. Because there--You know, I share with her the insights and so forth.  That was an advantage I never had, 'cause there was nobody to share insights with.
Speaker 1: Yeah your wife [Kathryn Mounday Kaiser].  She has played a very important--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Can you just touch upon that?  I mean you were a tra--you know you were a corporate executive.
Speaker 2: Well I mean inside a corporate system, and I think any system--I mean you require tremendous support to handle the kinds of level responsibility and pressure that you get within you know your own business or whatever.  And I've been very fortunate in, in a spouse who gave up her career who had the potential to do very exciting interesting things in favor of my career.  And raising a family. Who has been there with me every day when I come home and say, "Do you know what happened today?"  And we talked it through.  And she gives me--as one of, you know my most--She is my most trusted advisor of, you know, "Here's how to read this."  Or "Here's what I think."  And share with her those experiences.  Because you need to shed some of the things that, that happen to you within corporations and businesses etc. and has been there with me.  I mean she represents the company when we do business trips still.  And an entrepreneur.  When we have a Christmas function or something she's there representing the company like everybody else is. She did that when we were at Corning.  We would go and have meetings with all the sales people and I had the Latin American Asia-Pacific Area.  We had meetings in Thailand where she would travel and, and be the hostess of the meting and so forth.  She has played an absolutely critical role.  And in fact, your progress is judged by the team that you present.  If my wife were unable to handle the social responsibility and so forth, it would reflect upon my ability to progress as a manager.  And so she is every bit a part of the success in my career as I am.  And has been a rusted advisor and  has given me insight as to, you how to handle situations.  She is a corporate, corporate person too.  She just doesn't have the titles.

Speaker 1: I was wondering if you could name the boards you served on?  And what things you have learned serving on a board that is different working your way in the corporate structure?
Speaker 2: Well I serve on three corporate boards, Fortune 500 boards.  Right now, Mead Paper [Mead Consumer and Office Products], Stanley Tools [Stanley Works] and Sunoco which is a gasoline.  And I think the things that I have learned is, first looking at boards from the operating viewpoint I mean they look all powerful and all wise and all those kinds of things.  I mean there's a lot of preparation that goes into presenting to a board and so forth.  Sitting on a board and being at that level, is very, very different.  And there isn't as much mystique and mystery and all powerfulness in actually sitting on the board.  And, so I mean I've learned that the intimidation that you have--You know you run in this room and you have thirty minutes to make your pitch to this group, and so forth. They're not sitting there thinking (laughs) the same thing that you're thinking, or going through as you do it.  The other thing is, is being able to be with'Fortune 500 CEOs [chief operating officer], and, you know, the brightest and best that Corporate America has to offer. at least I found that my own skills were on a level that that was similar to there's given the experiences I've had.  I mean you can't be--if you're a CEO of IBM [International Business Machines, Inc.] or Dupont or something like that, those experiences are unique.  And if you've never been CEO of that, you can't, you can't have those experiences.  But, but putting that aside and trading you now, instincts and purchase and thought processes, I find that my skills are on a par with the people that I serve on the board with.  And the only difference is that I never was the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, never will be.  And, and they've had that set of experiences.  So that it gives them a little bit of a different edge. But on the other hand, I have sets of experiences that they don't have, related to views from the community.  I mean just a whole series of things that they, they don't have.  And I bring as any individual does, unique skills, international skills.  I've lived overseas, language, you know, that are specific to your experiences.  And they may or may not have had those experiences.  So everybody is there, you know, they all come and bringing different sets of skills and approaches which the CEO determines is valuable to them.  And, and that's kind of the way they look at it.
Story_ID: 9565
Speaker 1: So one--a couple things I wanted to address that you know, when you talk about HistoryMakers and so forth, is if I had been a HistoryMaker, there are several areas that I think I would want to comment on.  One is being the first and, and living as the first African American to be the first, you know, the first to run a business, the first to be Vice-President at Corning [Incorporated] which I was, the first to reach a certain level, the first to be CEO [chief operating officer] of a joint venture or whatever.  All those experiences and the myriad of impressions that you give to people and, and, and teach people about,  an African American in those roles are all significant.  I mean there's just a whole lot of situations, tests, where employees come and say "Well do you want to hire blacks, do you want to make money?" and things like that.  And how you address all those things and you being the person on the board where there had been no African Americans before.  And they all presume a certain kind of behavior.  And you either delight them or disappoint them or whatever.  But how you behave and respond, and respond to questions, respond to challenges all those things are pioneering experiences.  And they they help you create history.  They also, you know create impressions that open the doors or close doors for the people that come, come behind you.  But there have been a couple of experiences, one was a group that we formed in Corning which helped move Corning to a different level in several ways, it was a group called the Society of Black Professionals.  And it was organized by ten or eleven people back in, the early '80s [1980s], I think it was 1980 or so where we got together.  And said, "We can see why--and we had been told why none of us is gonna progress, but we can't understand why the whole class of people can't progress.  And we're gonna do something about it."  And we ended up forming a group that actually decided to work with the company, not against the company to do what the company said it wanted to do.  Which is to be an equal opportunity employer.  And to improve its recruiting, and retention and upward mobility of African Americans.  And we went through a whole series of interfaces and experiences--senior managers where we taught them and helped them understand about what it would take to be a company like that.  So much so that over time I think we were able to position Corning as one of the best places for African Americans to work in.  And that was the stated goal.  And we were able to achieve that goal but there were just dozens of situations and experiences and risk taking.  I remember at one time in my career as the head of that group, we had a meeting with one of the top executives.  And he was having an off-day if I had to describe it.  But we had a meeting and he likened himself to understanding what it was like to being a black corporation.  Because he was, Irish and grew up in an Italian neighborhood.  And he thought they equated.  And then the next statement that was made was we said, "Gee it would be nice if we could get an African American board member" and he said "Well I'm on a board and there is an African American and he doesn't contribute."  And so I remember raising my hand and saying, "Well one of the things that people are concerned about here as a group is that that they are not progressing as fast as they think they should progress in this company," and that individual took that as a personal statement from me.  And it cost me my career for having made that statement.  And I was talking on behalf of the group as the president of the group.  And I even said as president of this group, I know there are people here that feel this way and I want to put that question out and he said to me, "Are you talking about you?  So now I know what you stand for." And all that kind of stuff.  So we take risks like that, that are part of being a pioneer and creating history if you will within a company that cost you immeasurably.  And that might be one of the reasons I was never on the list, is I made too many enemies.  'Cause I was willing to confront the corporation on its behavior many, many, many times every day.  To say "Gee this is wrong, this shouldn't happen."  And I use to call general managers and say, "There is an African American in your group that's having this kind of problem.  You and I both know that shouldn't be happening in your group," and I don't know if I made an enemy or not but I did those kind of things for years and years and that kind of thing.  So that's one group.
Story_ID: 9566
Speaker 1: You said there were some pioneering things that were happening with diversity.
Speaker 2: Well, what I was meaning to say is that the Society of Black Professionals inside Corning [Incorporated] was a group that led Corning to a whole new awareness and level where we got an African American on the board.  Ultimately, you know, the dealing with the issues that diversity presents in terms of women's groups, African Americans, differences in payroll, all diverse issues.  Not just black and white.  But all that was heightened in Corning's system.  So that it became part of its quality system and the corporation built in processes to at least discuss that at, organizations to discuss that, training systems and so forth.  Where we made a difference inside Corning to where that company and how it used diversity.  It probably changed the company forever, not just with a board member but how it viewed diversity, how many people they recruited, how it counted things, everything.  And that was an effort of a bunch of people that took a stand and a high mortality rate.  I think of the original eleven members, when I retired there was only me and one other guy.  All the rest were gone, executed or whatever.  Quit or frustrated. So there's a high mortality rate that's associated with pioneering.  And the same thing is true for Executive Leadership Council.  Where we formed that organization to make a difference.  And bring executives together where--and to talk about issues and things like that.  So that I, I spend time and trying and--and have you know as the second president of it.  I wasn't the founding president but I was the one that kind of focused the strategy of that organization and kind of got it off going in the right direction.  'Cause we floundered for the first two years.  And then I became president and it got focused. I think that made a pioneering kind of history making difference and helped elevate that organization to where it is seen as a, a new force in the community.  Not so new anymore but it was at that time, a new group of people.  I mean we had kind of the church people and the political people and so forth.  And now all of a sudden you had no kidding, real legitimate business people who spoke business language, understood business language, understood business concepts and view points, strategists that were African Americans that could also speak for the community and relate the two, tra-, you know, bridge the two concepts.  And all of the efforts that we made in reaching back and networking and all those kinds of things that was another pioneering type of thing. And that's led me to get involved in different leadership groups. With you know, people that range from Dr. Dorothy Height, Coretta [Scott] King, I mean just, Dick Gregory, I mean Maya Angelou.  There's just dozens of people that, that, that have been involved with in trying to make a difference in the community.  That, that kind of goes back to the roots what I said that, who I am as a person.  That started with how my mother [Jane Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd] viewed civil rights and her stands and all that kind of stuff.  I'm still involved in it.  I'm retired yet I still go to the leadership groups.  I go to the Executive Leadership Council.  I gave many, many speeches, in different areas for diversity.  I use to work with Roosevelt Thomas on his board and then some of his conferences on diversity.  So I'll stop talking but those were the kinds of things that if you were to say, as a HistoryMaker, in those kind of texts not only being first but standing up and being counted I think is critically important.
Story_ID: 9567
Speaker 1: Who do you think is the most influence in your life?
Speaker 2: I'd have to say my mother [Jean Aileen Gordon Kaiser Floyd]. Her value systems and expectations she would be the person I would name.
Speaker 1: Who have you most respected in business?
Speaker 2: Hmmm.  In business?  Hmm.  I don't know that there is a person that I would most respect in business as an individual that I could just name.  I don't think of it that way.
Speaker 1: What are your concerns or hopes for the black community?
Speaker 2: My hopes are that the community can come together to use its power and influence to make a difference for itself. That is the there is leadership and our constituencies that can make almost anything happen within the community and with the proper strategy and I see myself an actively think about this as a kind of a vision with the strategy that those of us in corporate America have learned and how to think about things that if we were to use the resources in the community.  My hope is that they can come together to make a difference.  That is there's you now, brain power money, economic buying power.  All those things.  Communication systems that exist to make the community effective and that all it needs to do is be organized.  And that may be my ultimate dream is how to organize the community.  And I have some ideas on how to do that.
Speaker 1: And then what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well as I said the legacy I would like if they were to write on my tombstone is that people would come together after I passed away and say, "He really did make a difference.  He made these things happen, he made, you know, thought about things this way and he made a difference for his family.  He made a difference in the community by sharing his knowledge and skills and wealth and everything.  And, and that it was significant."
Story_ID: 9568
Speaker 1: What are some of those ideas about how the community can come together?
Speaker 2: Well I think that just to give you one example, there are numerous groups in the community that have different functions and capabilities. For example if you want to get a message out, the churches can get a message out. If you wanted to demonstrate against a product and could communicate that through the churches, between the churches and the leadership.  There are effective ways to do that.  For example what if I were to send--if I were angry at Coca-Cola [Company].  What if I were to send them a million tops off of their cans?  You don't have to stop buying Coke to scare Coca-Cola.  You could send them a million tabs off their cans in the mail, thirty-three cents each done through the churches as called by the leadership.  And tell Coca-Cola you're gonna do that.  And if it showed up, they would effectively realize that you could boycott them.  And you don't have to boycott anything.  For example that's just a very simple--And we could touch the different organizations to lend their strength, just for an instant.  That the leadership could unite just for an instant on a single issue.  Whether it be voting or any--You know, to strike somebody or whatever.  The power that's in the community is absolutely enormous.  The problem is its dispersed and, and its very hard to organize and to focus on anything at any one given time.  But if it could, I think you could change the face of America.
Speaker 1: Anything else you want to say?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh. (laughs) you got five more tapes, right?  No I, I think its great, the project that you have, what you're doing here.  I think that the community must always remember that there are lots of people who made up the civil rights struggle.  Dr. Martin Luther King who obviously was a tremendous leader, made a major contribution is only one of the faces that goes back to the early 1900s and what people did then.  All the way to what people are doing now.  And the fact that you're documenting hundreds of people in a little way just like Rosa Parks sat on the bus.  I found out the other day there was a lady who sat on a bus several years before her.  And did exactly the same thing that they just finally recognized.  That those stories are the stories that people have to realize that it wasn't only Dr. Martin Luther King and everything changed.  It was a whole tide of people of which he was one and has been chosen as the one to be recognized the most with a holiday and all those kinds of things.  But there were, you know, like Roy Wilkins did on TV and everybody did in their way, Vernon Jordan, everybody. And many, many people before them. There was a guy before Thurgood [Marshall], right? (laughs) Many guys--And Thurgood was an apprentice under this guy to make it happen.  I can't pull up his name.  But everybody's forgotten his name and thinks of  Thurgood and that he's the guy that did it.  And it was a team of people forever and it's gonna be a team of people going into the future, people like you and me that makes the difference.
