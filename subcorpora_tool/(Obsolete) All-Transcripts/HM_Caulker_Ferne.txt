Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers, our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My full name is Ferne Yangyeitie Caulker Bronson [HistoryMaker Ferne Yangyeitie Caulker].  My professional name I go by Ferne Yangyeitie Caulker, and the spelling is F-E-R-N-E, Y-A-N-G-Y-E-I-T-I-E and Caulker C-A-U-L-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Eight, nine, forty-seven, August 9, 1947. I was born in Sierra Leone, West Africa in a hospital in a s- little town called Rotifunk.
Speaker 1: Rotifunk--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: R-O--R-O-T-I-F-U-N-K, Rotifunk.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: My occupation, I have--well first of all I am an artist, a dancer, choreographer and I'm also a teacher.  I have grown from being a dancer into what is I think a logical progression into a historian.  I teach and have created history classes about African Americans and African people tracing our progress- progression from Africa to the New World through dance.  I started the company as a dance in 1969, and then in 1971 went to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], where I started as a lecturer in the department of African American studies [Department of Afro-American Studies] at the time that it was called.  Now it's called Department of Africology.  And that was my first home at UWM, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1971.  Then through the years moved into the School of the Arts [Peck School of the Arts, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and started on tenure track and now in 2007 I'm a full professor there.  So the company was in '69 [1969] that started in '71 [1971], married, had a child [Yetunde Bronson] so I had all--I think I had four careers.  I was a wife, a mother, a dancer, choreographer, a director and starting a track at a university all at the same time.
Speaker 1: UWM is the University of--
Speaker 2: Of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And the company is a professional affiliate there at the university.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's Ko-Thi [Ko-Thi Dance Company]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is 11/30/07 [November 30, 2007].
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at the Ko-Thi Dance Company administrative offices at 342 North Water Street in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and our--but our studios and our artistic activities happen at many different sites throughout the city.
Speaker 1: Okay performances can be in different venues.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 449773
Speaker 1: Now before we go in depth there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: --that management compels me to ask everyone and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, I have a favorite food and it's a home food from Sierra Leone and it's, it's made out of palm oil.  It's called kren-kren (laughter) and kren-kren is like a greens and it's the way it's cooked.  The best texture for me to say is it's a little slimy, it's like okra.  It has the texture of okra, but there's nothing like it--that and cassava leaf.  These are dishes that are national dishes, Sierra Leone, made out of palm oil.  You eat them with rice and they can have smoked fish in it and oxtails and just all of the comfort food.  And then the best is when it is served with fufu, which is made out of cassava.  Sierra Leone fufu is very distinct and that's one of my favorite dishes.
Speaker 1: Okay how do you spell kren-kren?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure but I think the phonetic would be K-R, it's--phonetically it would be kren-kren, K-R-E, kren-kren, K-R-E-N-K-R-E-N, kren-kren; I'm not sure of the actual spelling-spelling of it.  I grew up as a child just knowing that name.
Speaker 1: Okay now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Orange. I think orange is my favorite color, and I think it's because it's sunshine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I think the favorite time of the year is right, right at the end of summer, in this hemisphere, right before fall starts.  That change of season right when the leaves are gold and again that goes back to my orange color.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not particularly any place is a great, any place is a great vacation destination if it's a place where I can put my feet in the sand and read a book and nobody's bothering me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh my god, well I guess the one is that God doesn't give you anything that you can't handle.
Story_ID: 449774
Speaker 1: Well I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Solomon Brooks Caulker] side but we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes my mother's name was Olive Leah, L-E-A-H, Selby, S-E-L-B-Y [Olive Selby Caulker].
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well she was born--I think that now for me to give that her date of birth was July 10 and you asked me about her date, she was seventy-eight--seventy-four when she died, so she had to have been born in the '20s [1920s] or '30s [1930s]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --twenties [1920s], yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you know about your--oh where was she born I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: She was born down south, and she was raised as a southern girl and her family was through Ohio but actually ended up in Tennessee and Alabama.  My mother was an African American and she, and her father [Eustis Selby (ph.)] was Jamaican.  He was one of those rare people of color who actually came through Ellis Island [New York, New York], which a lot of people don't think about when they think about black people in America coming through Ellis Island.  We always think of the Middle Passage but he came to the Caribbean door, and so, and her family on my mother's side also had a lot of Native American Indian ancestry too so that my mother's--my grandmother came from a line that could have actually passed for white.  I say this only because it is relevant in terms of when she met my father and the family reaction when she decided to marry my father.  If we think back to what the '40s [1940s] were like and she was a young college woman at that time. Her being very light skinned, marrying a very black, dark African man at a time when Africa during that time was still perceived and even described as the Dark Continent.  My mother was actually very brave, you know, and she was very adventurous and went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and that's where she met my father in the early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Okay now I don't want to get too far ahead of--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --her side of the family, but was she born in Ohio or Tennessee or Alabama?
Speaker 2: She was born in Ohio, I believe is my understanding.
Speaker 1: Do you know exactly where?
Speaker 2: No, I can't remember the date and I should but I mean I know when she was born--
Speaker 1: But the town, I mean the place (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The town, oh my god, no I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember the town.
Speaker 1: So was she raised in Ohio?
Speaker 2: They moved around and I know that Ohio was where her grandparents were so a lot of the pictures that I have are of her with family in Ohio and there was a link there in Ohio.  But also my coming into the picture--my memory of, of my grandparents and my mother was mostly down in Tennessee--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did she--was her mother living there or--?
Speaker 2: They were in Tennessee when my mother met my father and went to Africa, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 449775
Speaker 1: So your great-grandparents were in Nashville [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: My grandparents--
Speaker 1: Your grandparents. Okay, grandparents, okay, in Nashville (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) were in Nashville, yes.  Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, are there any stories about what your mother's [Olive Selby Caulker] people were doing when they--
Speaker 2: Well my father was--my grandfather was a part of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] publishing business and my grandmother was a housewife and raised three children, but my grandfather was very involved in the publishing business in Nashville, Tennessee (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that's the headquarters for the A.M.E. publishing, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he was involved in that and that's pretty much my memory of them at that time.  We didn't see them a lot because we were mostly in Africa.  My first thirteen years of my life were actually in Africa, so.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Yes Selby, Eustis, Eustis Selby [ph.].
Speaker 1: Eustis Selby now was he a reverend?
Speaker 2: No, no he was not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Are there any stories--did that family have a long history in A.M.E. church?
Speaker 2: My understanding was yes they did and they were--mostly I remember as a child was the publishing part of it and then my mother at some point when we were in Africa going to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] to get her college degree in library science.  But I you know I didn't really know my grandparents that well on both sides of the family and a lot of that has to do with geographic location.  We were in Africa most of the time, they were here so the only time I had any bonding at all with my grandfather was much later in his life after my grandmother had passed and that wasn't a whole lot of bonding either.  So really my experience with those grandparents is very limited, not too many stories about that, didn't get to know them very well and I always felt bad about that but that's just the circumstances of the way we were living, we were just not in this country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories that come to mind from that side of the family about life in Nashville or Ohio? Now were they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I can tell from my aunt who is now ninety-two years old who grew up during that time is that you know my--in roots I know that my family, they were all teachers.  My grandfather and my grandmother and they lived on the same campus where I can't remember whether it was in the second or third part of 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] where the college campus where they talked, I can't remember the name of the campus but they knew all of those people during that time.  So my family on my mother's side were very educated and I think there was a term used of the Talented Tenth, you know, the Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois]--and all of those folks.  They were in that echelon of teachers and during the Depression [Great Depression] I remember so well my aunt telling me about how they always had some kind of food on the table even though there were a lot of other people suffering because they had that teaching community you know.
Speaker 1: Now were they part of Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] by any chance?
Speaker 2: No it wasn't Wilberforce.
Speaker 1: Or Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], or--?
Speaker 2: No I'm trying to think of the campus in 'Roots' at the end of the 'Roots' where they actually talked about that because my family all knew those people.
Speaker 1: That's in Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think it was in--I'm not sure if that was Ohio.  But anyway 'cause I was very young at the time and you're making me want to go back and look at all of that.  But it was a different kind of upbri- of being brought up.  In the times when we would come and visit, I was in a household that was highly educated, very verbal and I would say you know travelled also.  My grandfather, they used to travel a lot around the South and I don't even know what they did when they travelled, mostly I think it was related to the church in terms of the publishing business because I never went with them on any of those.  And whenever we came to America we were just visiting, it would be for short little time, bits of time and then we would go back.  So that's pretty much my memory of that side of it but I know that side of the family--what I do definitely remember was the level of education and the level of networking and the echelon in terms of economic bracket was at the high end.  My grand- my, my aunt today still talks about her godmother who was a mortician and this is the Victorian era and they lived in a very what would be considered you know at the time, a very wealthy family and had servants and people who you know took care of the house.  This is how, this is how my aunt talks about her life and childhood during the Victorian era.
Speaker 1: Yeah mortician is usually the richest black person in town (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right and during that time definitely for sure and still today but, but during that time for sure.  So there, there again you know there was a kind of--they were in another economic bracket for sure.
Story_ID: 449776
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Olive Selby Caulker] have any particular stories about growing up that she shared with you that you remember?
Speaker 2: M- a lot of the stories my mother told me about were remembering you know the lynchings, growing up in the segregated South, talked about that a lot.  One of the things that used to exasperate her a lot was the fact that so many young people today didn't seem to appreciate or understand what was going during that time, the reality of what was going on during that time.  I remember her talking about you know them not being allowed to go out to play because the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] was out you know and actually hearing guns going off and everybody--and it, it not being overtly talked about but everybody had, there was a sense of fear that was there and the fear of not wanting to scare them as kids but they knew that something was going on, why they couldn't go outside you know.  And when we went to visit in Nashville [Tennessee] a couple of times, this is before Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and the whole movement, black people were still required to sit in the back of the bus.  I remember as a child you know my mother was taking me--we had stayed one whole half of year or so in Nashville while she was at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] for a year, I think it was and she wanted me to have sewing classes, in fact that's how I learned how to sew, she signed me up.  But I remember us going on this trip into Nashville sitting on the back of a bus or we'd go to a movie and we'd have to go through a side alley and up in the top which was always kind of interesting to me. She would then explain to me why because I didn't understand, we'd come from Africa, I had no idea what this was all about. And it was always rather weird to me because the best seats in the house in the movie theater when we were in Africa was up in the balcony (laughter).  So when I came here and it was like that's where black people had to go, I thought it was pretty funny 'cause that's where I went anyway.  But I didn't understand the significance as a child you know what that was really all about until I got here as a teenager went into high school [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and then realized my god this is something quite dark that's going on here.
Speaker 1: Or white (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, exactly. So you know my memories from them in talking to me are memories of their memories of that era and what it was like for them growing up.  You know and it was so weird for me because I had never experienced anything like that as a child in Sierra Leone growing up my first thirteen years, where we were the majority and white people were the minority (laughter).  So I never grew up in an environment where--my psyche has never been damaged from that standpoint because the most important years of my life everybody around me that were my, my mentors or family on my father's [Solomon Brooks Caulker] side they were all beautiful black people.  Dressed in their African attire or not but it was never a question these things never came up, race never came up and I was living in an international community as a child at the university [Fourah Bay College, Freetown, Sierra Leone] growing up with a very international community.  One of my best friends is in England now and she works in the House of Parliament [Palace of Westminster, London, England] and we grew up together in Sierra Leone at twelve years--you know nine, ten and eleven years old.  I never thought anything about it until in adulthood is where you know the race became an issue but as children growing up in Africa we never thought 'cause we were babies and we didn't know the subtlety.  I didn't understand the subtlety of colonialism and what it had done, but I knew that there was a synergy and an energy that was going on because of who my father was and what was going on in the household pre- pre-independence.
Story_ID: 449777
Speaker 1: Now I want to get to that in-depth further along, but, now, did your mother [Olive Selby Caulker] go to high school in Nashville [Tennessee] or did she (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well down south for sure, and then, and then you know she did her undergrad work and then of course she went to go get her master's degree at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], which she did after she had married my father and going to Africa and for some reason he intuitively pushed for her, for her and myself and my sister to go to Nashville and stay with the family and go to school.  It's almost like he knew he wasn't going to live too long.  And he wanted to make sure that she had a marketable skill.  For some reason he knew this because he died in a violent death, which we can talk about later and that's how we ended back in the United States (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well let's, let's bring his family into this.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes my father's name was Solomon Brooks Caulker and he was from a--
Speaker 1: Is there a story--
Speaker 2: There is a huge story about him.
Speaker 1: Yeah excuse me I wanted to ask about his name first.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.
Speaker 1: Is Caulker like a ship's caulker, is that what it's about?
Speaker 2: No, it's C-A-U-L-K-E-R and there's a huge history about the Caulker name.  Now first of all if you run into any Sierra Leonean who is let's say 70, 80, yeah even 60, but 70, 80 years old and you mention the Caulker name either Richard Caulker [Richard E. Kelfa-Caulker] or Solomon Brooks Caulker they will remember those two names because the Caulker name was a very vibrant and very involved in politics and education in Sierra Leone as I was growing up.  Richard Caulker was an ambassador--
Speaker 1: Was that his brother, or--?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the United States and was also running one of--the Albert Academy School for Boys [Albert Academy] in Freetown [Sierra Leone].  My father was the vice principal of Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone [Freetown, Sierra Leone].
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.  How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: F-O-U-R-A-H, F-O-U-R-A-H, Fourah Bay College, which is one of the oldest college institutions in the West Coast of Africa hooked up to the British system.  So he, so you know I was surrounded by people who were very, very involved.  My father was very involved with and passionately involved.  I do recall this as a young girl, a lot of people would be by our house all of the time because they were prepping for the fight to maintain their, to get their independence from the British, and he was very involved with that.
Story_ID: 449778
Speaker 1: Caulker is not an African name, so--
Speaker 2: Well yeah.
Speaker 1: --is there a story behind how you got the name Caulker (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, there is. There's a story, there's a story behind that.  My--the story is that there was an Englishman who went to Sierra Leone.  This would have been, this had to have been in the early 1900s and he fell in love with a young woman who was from the Sherbro people and his spelling of his name was C-O-K, Coker, C-O-K-E-R, and he fell in love with, with this African Sierra Leone woman from the S-H-E-R-B-R-O and that's started a line.  And then there are like three family lines that broke off out of that.  Somewhere in the middle of all of this somebody changed the name to C-A-U-L-K-E-R, and then that line--my grandfather and grandmother had--well my grandfather had more than one wife, and my father [Solomon Brooks Caulker] came off of the first wife line; the head wife.  I often tell people this and people are like always think it's pretty interesting and I always try and explain to people that a lot of men think, oh yeah I'd love to have more than one wife but they don't understand the rules and etiquette that go with that.  The first wife picks the others (laughter) and there is an actual rule, there is a culture and an etiquette that is followed.  Nothing--it's not exotic or anything like that and I know very little about it because it wasn't talked about, all right.  But my grandmother was definitely the matriarch and--
Speaker 1: So now let me just get this straight, the white man named Coker--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --he was the, your great-great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Great-great-great, I guess you might say great-great- great-great- maybe yeah third great he would have been I think.
Speaker 1: And he was from England.
Speaker 2: Yes and there is still a Caulker crest in England.  You know you can still, we can still trace to this white family in England not that that would interest me in the least.  There are some sides of the family who thinks that is important, I don't happen to think that's of particular importance at this point in time given a struggle for the survival of our culture (laughter) you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this takes him back--he's back that f- that would take them back to the 19th century--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --somewhere in the mid-19th century.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Eighteen fifty [1850]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, something like that.
Speaker 1: --and maybe before.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: I think it was--okay I just want to establish that to make sure that we got that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah that's right, yeah, yeah you're right--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that goes back that far.
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 449779
Speaker 1: Fast forward (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--
Speaker 1: --to your grandparents now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  And I have--and they lived in what we would refer to as upcountry, which means not in the city.  Where we lived was in Freetown, which is the capital of Sierra Leone and they lived upcountry in the Sherbro territory and to get there takes hours and days or you can take a boat and come around into Bonthe Island [Sherbro Island, Sierra Leone].  But I have only short little vignette memories because when I was taken to them I was actually a very little child.  So I have very little memory of that.  I have one memory of my grandmother and I have a picture of her on my father's [Solomon Brooks Caulker] side.  I don't have any pictures of my grandfather on my father's side and she passed before he did.  I remember at my father's funeral, my grandfather--there was discussion about him, he was too old to come and I remember hearing that as a child.  I remember also that he was distraught that my mother [Olive Selby Caulker] upon my father's death that she was going to move my sister and I, and we were going to move back to the United States.  He was concerned that he would never see us again.  I do remember that discussion.  But basically I--again it's very, it's very interesting; I had very little contact with either grandparents on either side of the ocean, very little contact.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now the group, the Sherbro are they--what do you know about them?  Are they a traditional African group or is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a traditional tribe in Sierra Leone, but they're one of the smaller ethnic groups rather than the word tribe.  There is the Mende and the Temne, the Fula you know and Sherbros are smaller but they are very--the Sherbro people you can look them up and Google them and get a lot of information about Sherbro wars and chief- chiefdoms and a lot of intrigue and that kind of stuff going on around 1800s into the 1900s.  They were a powerful group, and the Caulkers were all in the middle of all of that.  The Caulker history is in the middle of all of that. And I didn't start like really understanding all of that until I came to the United States and was in college and starting looking up this stuff.  I had no idea, you know other little things about the family. Sierra Leone is also one of the major centers for initiation groups called the Poro, the men's initiation and the Sande, Bundu, which we also call, which is the women's initiation.  You can go to a lot of museums today and you see the Bundu, Sande mask, which is a helmet actually with a woman's face, very fine nose, but it's characterized by these coils of fat around the neck, characterized by the Mende people who actually aesthetically believe a woman with rings around her neck is actually very beautiful, and that she's a matriarch.  So, my father was--they were brought up in the Christian faith you know in terms of missionaries but they were also initiated in Poro.  And to this--of course all my uncles, I have two uncles left of fourteen children in my father's family and there are only--there's a sister and two brothers left.  The sister is in Sierra Leone, she's ninety-something, and the two brothers are in England.
Story_ID: 446588
Speaker 1: Now did your father [Solomon Brooks Caulker] talk about growing up, what it was like for him growing up in--?
Speaker 2: Well yeah--well not a whole lot but my fa- but what I have uncovered is you know and pieced together as an adult is that there is a tradition in Sierra Leone, and I think it's in, in a lot of African cultures, that those who get educated or when you become educated in many non-white cultures even in this country, you know people come--you come from a family and you get an opportunity to get educated and then it's your responsibility to reach back and bring somebody to you.  And my father went to mission schools in little village and then when his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What denomination was mission school (unclear)?
Speaker 2: These were basically--because my father actually became a minister in what was known as the Evangelical United Brethren, which later on, about twenty years ago, yeah, became United Methodist, but he was a minister in Evangelical United Brethren.  That's what got him through school and actually got him here, into the United States.  So he was, he was as a young boy went from the village environment into the city to stay with a relative, and in those situations you know it was a great opportunity because you go to go into the city school in terms of education and opportunities.  At the same time you were basically, you basically a house servant, you paid your way and you paid your way and I remember as a child growing up in Sierra Leone going to visit my aunts and uncles and seeing, and being, and seeing these children who were like going to get the groceries and cooking the food and cleaning and they didn't live in the house per se.  But they were relatives, you know distant cousins from upcountry who were given these opportunities.  In some situations it was a very, a very good experience and people--for my father even though he was, my understanding was abused in some of those, at times in that situation.  Because abu- child- you know what they--the things that were going on to children in Africa today people would like go to jail for (laughter).  You know I mean a lot of psychological and some physical abuse was going--you know beatings and--
Speaker 1: Even worse than here?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Worse than here?
Speaker 2: Not, not--I don't think it's worse.  Well first of all I don't know one child getting slapped or going to bed hungry because they didn't you know clean or there wasn't any food left after dinner 'cause they were eating only the scraps left after dinner and having to work and then by candlelight do their homework for school the next day and that's how they made their keep.  That's a form of abuse, you know.  So my father lived through that and survived that and became you know a really esteemed leader in Sierra Leone.  In fact when he died he died in an airplane crash on his return back from Israel at a conference that Israeli government had held with African leaders and the conference was to discuss (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year? I'm sorry what--
Speaker 2: This was nineteen sixty--1960, early 1960s, and this was to discuss the health and what was happening with the mortality rate of children in Africa in general.  And my father ended up actually being a major speaker.  He wasn't scheduled to be a speaker, but he ended up being a speaker at this conference in Israel.  And, the plane went down on their return with sixty-three people on board.  Just pri- just before that he would have been--he was a kind of a consul to the prime minister well who was going to go into that and he would have probably been ambassador to the UN [United Nations].  That was the next step he was going to go into.  In fact when my father died the whole of, all of Freetown [Sierra Leone] stopped and as a child I remember 'cause he was doing a radio show.  He spoke Mende, Temne, Sherbro quite a few of the languages fluently so he was doing a radio talk show and talking about how everybody was really excited about independence, but he was concerned that we would, as Sierra Leoneans, need to understand the symbolism of that and be able to move from the symbolic act into the reality of, of growth and changes and responsibility that that was going to mean as a society because we would no longer--it wouldn't be this patriarchal relationship with the colonialists anymore, but we would be controlling our own destiny.  And I, of course, as I was eleven years old, twelve years old. I don't remember the significance or even remember hearing him on the radio. All of this has come to me as an adult from people who were older than I am who now tell me stories about my father.
Story_ID: 446589
Speaker 1: I think that his background gave him a very--you know and he was also, when he came to the United States he was a philosophy--got his Ph.D. you know and he was a philosopher, and then of course he was also a minister.  So he had a very interesting combination there which is growing up in an African village with a very kind of royal family in a sense.  Not money royal but tradition and history, and then going into mission school, being initiated into the Poro, which is tradition.  My father [Solomon Brooks Caulker] was a minister but he was also a drummer (laughter) and he loved all kinds of music.  He was very into classical music and it was very interesting 'cause I remember you know World War II [WWII] the whole German thing.  I remember hearing German music being played in our house and my sister and I have often talked about this and thought what a strange thing.  We were in Africa and here is our father and he's playing German music and World War II is going on and it was like, the Jews, the Germans, it was just so interesting.  There was this kind of detachment from that because we lived in a really--Sierra Leone was such a utopia you know at the time and this horrible thing was happening in World War II that we were kind of oblivious to.  You know I was born in 1947 and that's when my parents--right before that my parents took a cargo ship from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and that's how he took her [Caulker's mother, Olive Selby Caulker] to Africa across the Atlantic [Atlantic Ocean] in a ship, in a cargo ship right after World War II.  So there were still German boats, you know, submarines in the Atlantic Ocean.  Here's two black people the only black people (laughter)--you know to me it's just hysterical.  I don't think they had any idea of the danger they were in.
Speaker 2: Okay, so did your father, did he go directly to the United States to get his education, or did he--?
Speaker 1: Yes, after--at college level, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, college level, so--
Speaker 1: --and that would, that would have been provided through the mission, you know, missionaries, Evangelical United Brethren at the time.
Speaker 2: Did he go right to University of Chicago, or did he go to another (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think when he met my mother then he was doing his Ph.D.  So I'm not too sure what else he did prior to that but that's--
Speaker 2: So you're not sure where he went to school before?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not too sure what his other background was before that.
Speaker 2: Right, now--
Speaker 1: I'd have to really dig for that.
Story_ID: 446590
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Olive Selby Caulker and Solomon Brooks Caulker] met?  Did they, did they talk about how they initially met (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it's, it's, it's really interesting because it made me change the way I deal with my daughter [Yetunde Bronson] in terms of talking about things because I've just been amazed at how many families don't talk about their family history, you know I've been amazed.  And it's to our detriment because we're not passing on the legacy to the next generation because the questions you're asking me are the questions that you know I started trying to dig--and I have one cousin on my father's side, my uncle's daughter and--Imodale Burnett--Caulker-Burnett [Imodale Caulker-Burnett].  And she's really the family historian and she's been doing a lot of digging and trying to piece together what she can on that end and asking the questions because they didn't talk a lot to us about their childhoods.  They did not talk about tradition and now I understand kind of why they didn't because they came into the United States for their schooling as many immigrants do.  And--whether it was German or you talk to Irish people they'll say the first thing they tried to do was lose their accent, or change their name so it didn't sound too German.  Now with us we couldn't like change the color of our skin so we were a lot more obvious.  But that's part of the American immigrant story is trying to make yourself become a part of mainstream, and to kind of lose your cultural identity to an, to an extent.  I think that plays into maybe why that generation didn't talk too much about the African part of their lives--of their childhood because when, by the time we came in the picture as the children, they had already been absorbed in a way.  My father was now a minister in Evangelical United Brethren.  We would come to the United States and would travel and we would be mostly in white people's homes and we would be the exotic Negroes that were paraded around from house to house.  And I remember as a child feeling incredibly uncomfortable with all of that because one of my most, one of my blatant first experiences of race in this country was as a little girl, I couldn't have been more than five years old and I still have a memory of this.  And I don't even remember what--we were somewhere in Ohio and I do remember because I remember the name--Ohio, the name, the word Ohio is, to a five year old, just sounded kind of like a musical word to me, Ohio, you know.  And, but I remember we stayed in this home and my father, you know here's my mother, an African American, my father with a very thick African accent and me and they would all--the adults would sit and talk or whatever and I'd--they'd say, "Go out and play with the kids."  But they never knew what kind of terror I was being subjected to when once those kids were with me out of sight of the adults.  And it was a lot of ridicule; there was a lot of pulling of my hair, touch- you know throwing me down, there was a lot of pulling my skin, rubbing to see if the black was going to come off.  There was a lot of that going that my family never knew about, you know.  And were--I really don't think that they were conscious because they weren't being treated that way.  So I know what it is to grow up as an exotic.  You know, I know what that feels like, and I know what it also feels like to--and I think I've settled and understood and I'm not angry with them for not doing (unclear).  Because one of my, for many years one of my things that I was most upset with my father was that he spoke Mende, Temne, Sherbro fluently but never taught me, in our household, not a single word.  The only, let me say this, the only word I know in the Sherbro language and everything else I learned I've gone and bought myself a Sherbro language book and trying now to teach myself is (speaking Sherbro) is white--I don't speak white (laughter).  That's what I knew as a tiny little girl growing up, (speaking Sherbro).  So, and Sherbro was a beautiful language but none of my elders spoke it to us 'cause everybody was speaking English 'cause that's what you did in those days, you spoke English.  If you spoke English it meant you were cultured, if you spoke English it meant you were educated, if you spoke English it meant you were accepted by the colonialist and you were accepted.  You see, and that's no different than today we see young people rebelling against that and you know one of the studies that's come out is that young black children ridicule other black children who speak good English and say you're trying to be white.  Isn't that interesting how (laughter) times have changed and I think part of that is rebellion, is that young people today are saying what good did it do you?  (Laughter) So they're saying, why should I speak all of that?  I'm going to do my little, my hip hop thing why do I need to try and shift shape myself into that image because you did it and I'm seeing all the ancestors do it and it didn't do you all too much good.  You're still, you're still a nigga.  You see what I'm saying, so (gesture) it's been interesting, I've been able to see both sides of this very--you know.
Story_ID: 446591
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' [Olive Selby Caulker and Solomon Brooks Caulker] personalities, their talents, their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, I think my ar- I think that my artistic side actually believe it or not is from my father and my father's side because I also had an aunt--a cousin who, as a little girl I thought she had no feet because she always wore these long, flamboyant agbada outfits, these African robes.  I never saw her in western clothes, and as a little girl she just always seem like she was gliding wherever she was going, you know.  And sh- I found out later that because nobody again in the family ever talked about her.  Her name was--I called her Auntie Yetunde, named my daughter [Yetunde Bronson] after her and I found out later I was very attracted to her psychically and never understood why; it was a spiritual kind of thing.  Now I know it was a muse that was attracting her to me 'cause I found out later she was an artist--a visual artist that nobody in the family took it seriously.  What she wanted to be was an artist, and that was the kindred spirit that attached to me.  So my--I think that came from--'cause my father also as a child growing up had a lot of singing groups at the university [Fourah Bay College, Freetown, Sierra Leone].  I found out later of course 'cause when you're initiated in the Poro you can't talk about it.  But I did kind of wrestle that out of my uncle you know and he told me all I can tell you is that your father was a drummer in the Poro.  You know, and of course once my father became a minister he never talked about that.  You know, there is no way in the Evangelical United Brethren my father was going to tell those people that he was initiated in the Poro and drummed.
Speaker 1: I don't know what indication you might have but do you think your father or how do you think he tried to balance the two things?  You know, did he, was he, did he believe in Christianity or did he really believe in Poro or did he believe in both at once?
Speaker 2: Well Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] once said that--I think it was Du Bois who said that the trick of the man in the 20- 20th century at the time is that we have to--you're almost a schizophrenic.  If you're--and I took this one step further that to be a healthy person of color in the world you almost have to be schizophrenic.  You have your tradition, and then your mainstream.  It's not just people of color but so many cultures do this, you know.  They try to maintain their traditions at the same time mainstream.  And so you walk a razor's edge all the time to maintain your psychic wellbeing.  Okay, so I think my father did what--because the majori- Kwame Nkrumah and all of his peers at that time got educated through mission schools.  So all of the leadership in the post-colon- pre-colonial and then independence and then post-colonial Africa were all trained outside of the African continent, and it was mission schools and missionary money that put them through these schools because their families didn't have money.  So something was going on there with them in terms of you know the psychology of that because they grew up with tradition but most of them put that to the side.  And then my generation came up as their children, we were not--that was not shared with us, that was not shared with us.  So it was only as we grew older that we became at least for me I became almost neurotically possessed with having to go back and try to connect culturally and I did it through the, through my dance.
Story_ID: 446592
Speaker 1: Do you think if your father [Solomon Brooks Caulker] had lived, or you'd been raised completely in Sierra Leone that you would have been initiated?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a great question.  I mentioned to you earlier about my grandmother and I never grew up knowing her name or anything, she was just Grandma--Ma Caulker.  Because I only knew, I only met her one time when I was five and that was it.  So I never had any contact with her.  Most of what I know about her has come to me as an adult because I'm asking questions.  But the most profound thing that I found out about her as the matriarch is that, they were--and they were brought up as Christia- they practiced the Christian faith, but they also practiced traditions, you know, ancient African tra- Sierra Leonean traditions of which I don't have a whole lot of definition about except this, that in the Sande women's initiation, they were still practicing clitoridectomies and I know that in the, in the mid-1900s, yeah, my grandmother passed an edict as really the matriarch of the village that said that none of the Caulker women would be initiated into the Sande because of that practice.  So she made a conscious decision after finding out all there was to find out about it.  She knew enough, and she was not an educated woman, but she knew enough that that was not a good thing.  Now the result of that is that my generation--all of my cousins who were my age, sixties and seventies now, and our children now never got the embodiment of the lessons and what Sande had to teach.  Because inside of the Sande and what we grew up knowing as Bundu is all of the rituals, the, the dances through which the rituals and the code of ethics and behavior that are taught.  So it's a whole genera- two, two generations now that are kind of just lost.  Not really western, western onus but not--but confusion underneath that because we're not attached.
Speaker 1: Now is--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --was the, was the female circumcision linked to Islam at all? I mean were the--
Speaker 2: Well the Islamic faith is very dominant all over the west coast and yes very dominant in Sierra Leone, but, and I'm not too sure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So were your father's people Muslims before they converted--
Speaker 2: No, they were not Muslims, they were not Muslims so I'm not too sure--
Speaker 1: Or had they been before they were converted to Christianity?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of, not that I know but that doesn't mean that they wasn't true in the 1800s--17- 1800s.  But I do know that circumcision is tied into the Muslim religion, and I do know that the Islamic faith has a very profound strength in West Africa.  So I don't know what that link is into what was happening in the Sande, but I know that was happening when I was a little girl still, and that I know that none of my cousins and my family, the females, partook in that therefore were never initiated.  And for me that is an area of mourning for me because as an artist to the disconnect of us not being able to experience that not that part but the cultural part of being in Sande is that we didn't learn the stories and the, and the songs and the rhythms and the dances because the way all of the ethic codes are taught was actually through dance.  So it would have been the perfect place for me to go, given my bent towards dance.  But on the other side, it was the most imperfect place for me to go, given my family's concern for that.
Story_ID: 446593
Speaker 1: We always ask people this question: what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?  And you have these two places to--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) vastly different places to talk about, so--
Speaker 2: Well it's very interesting because first of all my memory in terms of sights and smells.  The house where we lived was on Mount Aureol [Freetown, Sierra Leone], which was--you know that's where the university of Fourah Bay [Fourah Bay College] is in Freetown [Sierra Leone], and you, when you go up the mountain my house was like one of the third, fourth, fifth house that you would see as you were coming around the bend up onto the campus.  And it sat right on the mountain and you could look down and you could see from my house parts of Sierra Leone.  You could see the, the parliament house, which sat on a hill in the middle of the city and then beyond that, miles and miles away, you could see the Atlantic Ocean and I could see huge ships coming.  It has one of the largest natural harbors and you could see ships coming in to the harbor.  It was always the first vision I have or smell is always from my bedroom window is the, the salt air from the ocean; it would come right up the mountain.  So you could smell the salt air.  There was al- Harmattan season I always remember this dry wind.  Before the campus became very, very busy I remember as a child watching families of monkeys that would be moving.  They'd go down into the villages--into the city at night to get food and then they would come up early in the mornings and you'd see the older ones on the ground and the mothers of the little babies on their back.  I grew up seeing all of that it was that close to me and this is when I was like four or five; three, four or five with those memories.  Smells, definitely growing up in an environment that was completely forest- forestation so there was a smell of decay as well as very vibrant smells of flowers and plants.  You know that you could--when they open in the morning you could smell all of that. So you would get this sense of decay, leaves and forest, you know.  Everything that's on the bottom, but on top of that would be this light kind of very vibrant scents that you knew were related to very vibrant, bright colors. The scents of food being cooked.  I mean my favorite dish you could smell that for miles in the households on Saturday.  Saturdays was palm oil day and fufu day and so every house was cooking some type of palaver sauce is what we used to call it because it takes so long to do, palaver great conversation while it's being fixed, and--.  So you would smell all of that.  The smell of fufu is very--it's a pungent smell 'cause it's actually cassava that has soured and fermented.  They serve it in the marketplace.  I remember going to the market with my mother [Olive Selby Caulker] and the smells of dried fish, or what we used to call Bonga, pungent, very, very pungent smell and you go to another stall and you'd smell coconut being cracked open or grated everything fresh, every single smell.  I remember my mother coming home from going to the marketplace and the kitchen in our house would be just so--the smell of just everything so fresh.  You knew--the oranges you could smell and when I came to this country one of the things that got me when I went into the grocery stores, now I'm talking about this other scents, was that everything--there was no smell to anything (laughter).  You know like the bananas were like yellow but at home if a banana was that yellow it was like--it wasn't yellow it was black.  I mean a black banana is a ripe banana (laughter) you see what I mean? And no smells.
Story_ID: 449780
Speaker 1: But the, the smells, the oranges--when I first came to this country and saw, like I said at a grocery store oranges, piled up and they were all exactly the same color and they were orange (laughter) and I thought there was--something is not right about this picture 'cause where I grew up the sweetest oranges were green, absolutely green.  And an orange that was that color was not--it just was unnatural. You know the scent that I, I--yeah? I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think they spray them here.
Speaker 1: They spray them, yeah, and see Americans really don't know what food really looks like, or smells like, and that's scary.  'Cause I remember chickens I mean I've killed a chicken, feathered it or de-feathered it and prepared it to, to eat and there's nothing like a fresh chicken.  When you eat a chicken that's range free versus the chickens that we're getting now at the supermarket, it's kind of scary.  The taste is completely different.
Speaker 2: Now Brother Musa [ph.], who's in some of the pictures used to talk about the size--the unearthly size of these chickens that you see in the supermarkets.
Speaker 1: I mean I never--the chickens that we ate at home were the size of pigeons in New York [New York] (laughter).  And so the first time I saw an American chicken I was freaked out, far too much fat on it.
Speaker 2: Well sights and sounds and smells are what we're talking about, of growing up.
Speaker 1: Sights well one other thing about smells too is that when my mother's sister, Alise [ph.] would come she came two times when we were in Africa and or any Americans a lot of the Peace Corps would come so I got to know a lot of the Americans as a child growing up who had came in the Peace Corps.  But particularly with my aunt I would always couldn't wait 'til she arrived because the first thing I would want to do would be to as soon as she opened her bag was to smell inside of her bag because America has a very distinct smell; it's sweet, perfumed and sweet.  Compared to the tropical smells, and it was such, it was such a distinct change a sharp edge to it, and I've never forgotten that even when I came to this country when we arrived in New York you know the first smells--the pungent smells that I got were of the pretzel guys on the sidewalk and the hotdogs.  I mean that smell, it just knocks you out when you first come from another country and you smell that, and you're not too sure what that is you know.  So those were things that I, that I distinctly remember.
Story_ID: 449781
Speaker 1: And I was lucky in that I came over to this country in two phases, or three phases of my life as a very little girl on visits, then as an adolescent, which was different.
Speaker 2: Okay so you were--how old were you the first time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because we would come and visit. The first time we came over here I was very little and we came--I must have been about six because my sister was born in this country so--my mother [Olive Selby Caulker] was pregnant at the time.
Speaker 2: We didn't talk about this but you hinted at the beginning--was there a lot of drama in your mother's family about her choice of husband and how did that manifest itself?
Speaker 1: If there was I wasn't privy to hearing it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I know that when we came to this country and stayed in Nashville [Tennessee] in my grandparents' home the year that my mother was at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] getting her master's degree and I went to school in Nashville, Tennessee, my grandmother, who like I said had a lot Indian [Native American] blood in her and white and could pass--when she and my aunt would travel down south, my aunt told me this herself.  When they would travel down south they got to stay in places that normally black people didn't stay because my aunt played off as her maid and my grandmother was the white woman. Now she told me this herself, interesting; sad, but very interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah what a country.
Speaker 1: What a country, you know, what--it's just unbelievable and that's mother/daughter having to play these games so they could go to the bathroom for Pete's sake in a restaurant and sit down and eat.  But I was saying earlier, right before that?
Speaker 2: I was asking you about your fam- your mother's family's reaction to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh and talking about it--yeah, but there was never--oh, the only time that I got a sense that there was something not quite accepted about my father [Solomon Brooks Caulker] because, was the way my grandmother used to treat me that year that we were there.  She would constantly, if I passed by her, she would take her fingers and try to fix my nose.  She would do this (gesture) to my nose and this nose thing is really deep because it used to be so interesting to me because sh- one time she saw me kind of like, you know how kids do, picking my nose and she went into, I'll never forget it, I've never seen her so angry at me.  And she went into this whole thing about you don't want to spread your nose, and you want to keep your nose thin. You know what I'm saying? And as a child I didn't get the profundity of that until I became an adult and was at a conference and was on a panel and it was a panel of Africans and we were talking about our cultures and being, and coming into the United States and blah, blah, blah.  We started talking about dealing with your psyche and this African brother got up to the mic and he said, "I am--," he started to cry and he said you know, "I remember my mother constantly fixing my nose," and I just broke down because I thought, my god it's not just me.
Story_ID: 449782
Speaker 1: We have no idea, and the sad part is, is that Africans really don't, Africans don't understand African Americans, and African Americans really do not understand Africans, and it's sad because we have so much in common.  You know, from the colonialist attitude and degrading to slavery, master, plantation, degrading, we have come through the same kind of process, which--the end result of which is that we don't like ourselves.  We're not happy in our skins and to think that children at--that this young man and myself and other people in the room who concurred with all of this discussion.  People were just breaking down, it was like a barrier that just smashed open.  People started talking about you know their hair and their dark complexion and we--today in 2007 if you are a dark American or you are a black African, you still carry this, this thing of color and t- intonation of your body and your skin tone.  We still carry this, it's not, we're not healthy yet, we're not healthy.  That's why I created Ko-Thi Dance Company because I wanted people--you know because most of what we do is on a superficial level.  In the '60s [1960s] we put on the dashikis and we started learning African words and we played, we played African rhythms and we thought that was it.  But it could not have been it because look at the state of our communities, and look at, and we're not any closer to really--I don't think we're any closer to really embracing ourselves, we're still not there.  And how do I know this is because you can look at what's happening to all of us who are quote culturalists.  Suffering on the peripheral of annihilation because our communities don't support us you know, and I can't tell you how many black Americans in this country who run away as far as they can from anybody who is doing African dance and drumming.  I can't tell you how many black preachers preach against those of us who do African dance and drumming who believe it's pagan to this day in 2007.
Speaker 2: Yeah they believe it's of the devil, and such, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah I have in my office--do you know that when black people started--when we were singing and singing jazz and we would bend the fifth note you know when we would sing and you hear it in the gospel all of the time, we just don't sing the songs straight we'll take the notes and bend them.
Speaker 2: Give me an example of that, real quick.
Speaker 1: Oh let me see, I don't know (singing), "Amazing grace, how sweet, how sweet the sound," you see what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Instead of singing like a Congregational hymn (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah--just--yeah, right. But that fifth note, fifth, you know, the interval you know what they used to call that the devil's interval.  That says it right there.  That's what the, that's what the aca- academics in the music field referred to what black people were doing in terms of how we sang, it was the devil's note when we take that note and bend it.  It's called the devil's note.  You see, so, we have a lot of work to do, we're not anywhere near where we need to be--and hip hop, that's a whole other discussion.  I can't even get into because I think that hip hop has become one of--it's become a tool, and it's destroying the aesthetic and cultural vitality of our communities--
Story_ID: 449783
Speaker 1: Now you visited you said three times before you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --finally came back for good?
Speaker 2: Right and we came back--the last time was after my father [Solomon Brooks Caulker] passed--
Speaker 1: That's really not coming back (unclear).
Speaker 2: --and I went, and I went to an English boarding school in between that.  Is that after my father died before my mother [Olive Selby Caulker] moved here with us, she sent me to England to Cornwall School [West Cornwall School for Girls] in Penzance, Cornwall [England].
Speaker 1: Let's do a chronology real quick. Now you--okay so you were born in--
Speaker 2: Sierra Leone.
Speaker 1: --in Sierra Leone--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in, is it Rotifunk?
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. And you're basically raised--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Freetown [Sierra Leone]?
Speaker 2: In Freetown, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and, but went to the Annie Walsh Memorial School [Freetown, Sierra Leone], but before that was at the international school, which was a school where a lot the, you know, the teachers and people who worked in the embassies where their children went.
Speaker 1: Okay now that's the international--
Speaker 2: The international school--
Speaker 1: --school.
Speaker 2: --and this was the equivalent of an elementary school.  So I grew up in a very international kind of environment with children from many faiths, many cultures, many languages.  I mean that was a big part of, influence in my life and then went to Annie Walsh School for Girls.
Speaker 1: Is that in England? That was in--
Speaker 2: No that was in Sierra Leone--
Speaker 1: Sierra Leone, okay.
Speaker 2: --and then after my father died, that's when I went to West Cornwall School for Girls in Penzance, Cornwall, and that was traumatic also, too.  'Cause there, that's when I first experienced what it meant to be a minority didn't know what that was before that.  But being a minority in England is very different from in, at that time from being a minority in U.S. of A.
Speaker 1: Okay now--how so?
Speaker 2: Well, in England the British have always had a different kind of relationship with Africans than white America has had with Africans.  In England, they have a lot more knowledge of the cultures as having been colonialists who lived there.  They have a different affinity, and they've also absorbed more Africans into their communities.  You know not saying it's all been good but I'm saying there's been more awareness, okay.  So being in that English boarding school and a minority was, although traumatic, I still did not--there was a certain level of respect.  You know because for us to be there we had to have come from a certain kind of family background to even to afford to be there, okay.  So I didn't get that sense of--I knew--definitely there was isolation in being different but there was never any sense that I was lowly or lowlier than, okay.  It was when I came to this country that I experienced this other thing, which is that you're actually subhuman, that you're actually not--you don't have a culture, you don't have a valid history, you don't have a language because see in Britain nobody was asking me questions like, do you live in trees?  Because somehow the English child knew better, knew that was not true, somehow.  And I'm not saying that was across the board but at least in the experience that I had 'cause the African American children who were in that school, a lot of them were ambassadors' children you know and a lot of the white kids that were British kids that were in that school had lived in Africa so they knew better.  It was a different (unclear), totally.  When I came here, the questions that were being asked, you know, did you live in a tree, you know di- it was a whole shocking revelation that Americans had no idea.  Actually, it really freaked me out when I found out that it wasn't--the worst part wasn't that they didn't know about Africa, it's that they didn't even know where Milwaukee [Wisconsin] was (laughter).  That's when it really got to me it was like wow these people are like--they don't even know where Wisconsin is (laughter) on a map.  You know so how are they going to understand where I come from? It's not going to happen.  So, that's when I decided I wanted to teach 'cause I felt the only thing that was going to change was to get in a classroom.

Speaker 1: You were in school for, in Cornwall [at West Cornwall School for Girls, Penzance, England] for two years?  About two years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About two years, two yea- yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were, how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was, let's see, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then we moved here; that's when my mother [Olive Selby Caulker] got the job at Marquette [Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], and that's how I ended up at Custer High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  That's when I met John Daniels [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.] (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at Custer and I was a senior then.  That was my senior year.
Speaker 1: Now was the, did you find the--was the work a lot easier here?
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean I had gone through all the British school system by then and I was like way ahead of in, curricularly, what was happening.  I remember I was in a--but it was a difficult, traumatic time.  Going to Custer High School was, I think, one of the most traumatic times of my life because at the time I had a very thick English slash Sierra Leone accent, and you can ask John Daniels, I had a very thick accent, and--
Speaker 1: How, how would it sound, can you do it?
Speaker 2: Yeah I used to talk like this and then sometimes I would say things like petroleum instead of gas (laughter) and you know they'd say tap water and I'd say faucet (laughter).  You know and I mean it was just little words and sometimes the English would come out more but it was mostly I had a very, very distinct accent that was very pronounceable and clear, and clear. It was clear that I came from someplace else in the way I was speaking.  I was brought up to be very articulate you know to pronounce my words so at Custer I was ridiculed.  Because the white kids had never seen a black person like me before because also my hair was cut very short in what was then called a freedom cut.  'Cause it wasn't called an Afro then 'cause you know that was the Odetta [HistoryMaker Odetta Gordon] era.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: So you looked like Odetta--
Speaker 2: Odetta--
Speaker 1: --Abbey Lincoln.
Speaker 2: Abbey Lincoln that was called--it was related to being a revolutionary whatever.
Speaker 1: Miriam Makeba--
Speaker 2: Miriam Makeba--
Speaker 1: --those, those were the people we saw with it first.
Speaker 2: Exactly and so when I--my hair was cut like that and Milwaukee [Wisconsin] wasn't quite ready for that.  So here I was in high school and so the white kids thought I was a revolutionary Panther [member, Black Panther Party], right. And--
Speaker 1: Now what year was this, your senior year?
Speaker 2: This would have been 1964, something like that, yeah. And so we ended up, well I ended up kind of like walking a razor blade that senior year in high school.  I didn't go to the prom, I didn't do any of that stuff 'cause first of all I didn't understand it because where I came from people didn't make a big deal out of coming out of the equivalent of high school, you were expected to go to college. And I didn't understand all this hoopla, you know, I just didn't get it and I didn't understand the sports hoopla either.  The girls running around having to wear the guys' jackets, and I just did not understand all of that.  I got sucked into it, and then and it just didn't make any sense to me.  And I ended up dating a guy who was a medical student in Marquette and, and going into, becoming a doctor, he was from Nigeria.  And so I hung out in my senior year of high school, I was hanging out with college students because I didn't have any--you know I didn't feel any connection to what was happening in the, in the social scene.  Like I said I didn't go to the prom, I didn't do any of that.  And I think that people like John Daniels, I think he--John, I always remember him as being very quiet and he was like seen as the book- a bookie, just always in the books.  And look what it paid off for him you see.  So he was not part of that group that--I was not a part of that group either.  You know what I mean?  He was always over there and I was over here and then there was the group the athletes and the girls following the athletes and all of that kind of stuff.  So, that high school experience was very, very, very traumatic for me because I felt so disconnected with the rest of the students.
Story_ID: 449785
Speaker 1: And then I think, I've thought back about when I was in school at the Annie Walsh School [Annie Walsh Memorial School] in Sierra Leone [Freetown, Sierra Leone], I felt disconnected from people there too.  And then I just realized that a large part of my life I've always been the oddball.
Speaker 2: What was the source of the disconnectedness at Annie Walsh?
Speaker 1: Because my fa- because, because everybody else there were born to traditional Sierra Leone family, and my family was definitely not traditional because my father [Solomon Brooks Caulker] was Sierra Leonean, but he was married to an African American woman [Olive Selby Caulker], who--at that time, that was new.  And our household was different, it smelled different, 'cause--and the way my mother set up things 'cause she was an African American.  The household was just run differently.  So it was just different and so I didn't quite fit there either.  So I, I've never been afraid to be the oddball because I just am.  You know it is never--I've never felt that I needed to be a part of a clique or a group or bond with a group--that's never been my politics.  So when I grew up--as I came here and started developing a professional track for myself, I never thought it was important to become a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] or an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] or any of the s- I'm not opposed to them, but I just don't need, I don't need those structures.
Speaker 2: Now did you have mentors or special teachers along the way that you--?
Speaker 1: Yeah I had a lot of people who influenced me, not in a direct, took me by the hand kind of way.  It's interesting because I never stayed in one place long enough to really get that, okay. It wasn't until my--when I had established myself as a dancer that mentors started actually coming into the peripheral.
Speaker 2: Oh but not in school though?
Speaker 1: Not so much in school--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) 'cause I was not really ever in the--at Custer [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] I was only there one year, but I think it--I'm not saying there weren't teachers that influenced me, but to be a teacher who like really their influence put me on a track, that's where the--Pearl Primus is, who I'd taken a class from when she came to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] actually through the Milwaukee Modern Dance Council, which doesn't even exist anymore.
Speaker 2: Were you in high school then or--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was, I was in high school--well freshman year of college [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], you know.
Story_ID: 449786
Speaker 1: When did you start, when did you develop an interest in dance as a--I mean did you, did you like to dance when you were a girl, or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was always--as a child--
Speaker 1: Did you like athletic stuff, and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was very--first of all, I was a tomboy as a child.  I was always exploring territory that was dangerous (laughter).
Speaker 1: Like what?
Speaker 2: You know going down in the forest in the bush where I shouldn't be.  My sister and I just talked about the danger we put ourselves in on numerous occasions because we were living in a mou- on a mountain that was completely forest, and we would just go down paths you know and explore.  I mean it was just crazy some of the stuff we did.  But I think that, I think that my, my childhood--I think that the dancing--I was always fascinated with the holidays.  We had like Boxing Day, which is a British holiday right after Christmas, and traditionally in Sierra Leone, before the drugs came in and you know and all that negativity, I remember being on my father's [Solomon Brooks Caulker] shoulders and we would go downtown into Freetown [Sierra Leone] and Boxing Day is the day when all the masked characters come out or all the different guild groups.  So there's the hunting guild group and they have--that's a masked character that's covered with ra- dark raffia, but it had shells and animal heads and all kinds of things on it.  And then the drummers would be behind and we would just stand.  It's not really a parade in the sense of the way we think of a parade but all these different guilds and all these dance- dancers and the music and the dancers and the masked characters coming through, and the--.  That fascinated me to no end. And the other side of that was my father was, he had a huge album collection of classical music and musicals and he had (laughter) he had 'Carmen Jones' and 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin].  He used to turn that on and we were on a mountain and it's a tropical house where the windows are all open and I remember being outside and hearing (singing), "Bess you is my woman," and I was like that is the most beautiful song.  I remember saying I'm going to be in a play like that, and he doesn't know it but my father if he only knew the influence he gave me in terms of thinking way beyond the environment I was in.  So I grew up listening to Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] and Chopin [Frederic Chopin] and German music and then I also group up listening to African music and you know choral music and it was like constant as a child.  Every kind of music, I grew up hearing it.  So it was an easy transition for me to go into the dance.  Went to West Cornwall School [West Cornwall School for Girls, Penzance, England], very athletic, played tennis and wanted--at some point I thought I was going to be an Olympic tennis player, that's, that was a goal (laughter).  Then came to the United States, kind of stopped the tennis thing and realized that--looked at--I was a senior [at Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] so I was beginning to think about college and in England I'd taken some ballet classes and stuff.  And I think it was when I was looking and recru- thinking about college and where I wanted to go and found out that Madison [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] had a dance program, and that they had a guy there named Myron Nadel [Myron Howard Nadel] teaching primitive dance, is what it was called at the time (laughter).
Story_ID: 446601
Speaker 1: Now when you're on the verge of graduation, you knew you were going to college--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and there wasn't a problem with that.  You had the money (unclear) you weren't concerned about that either, I guess. Well, I don't know, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I got grants--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because my mother [Olive Shelby Caulker] was a divorced--I mean a widow then with two kids.  So I got college grants, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mother was teaching at Marquette [Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: She was head of the catalog department at Marquette University.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you decide to go to University of Wisconsin in Madison [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And now, had you--
Speaker 2: At the time then I wanted to be an anthropologist and I have to go back a second because the influence for that was--in stepped Pearl Primus.  And Pearl Primus prior to when I went--so that must have been my high school year [at Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] that I--yeah I think it was my high school year that I met her because she was brought here like I said by the Milwaukee Modern Dance Council at what was at the time the Downtown Y [Downtown YMCA, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], which was where the U.S. Bank is now.  And it was a cataclysmic occurrence in my life because I was talking to you earlier about this business with the nose and being dark skinned and wooly hair and wearing it as an afro in a, in a society that just doesn't appreciate our beaut- our beautiful bodies as people of color of African descent.  Pearl Primus was a, not a very tall woman but she was buxom.  She had big black hips and big mus- muscular arms and muscular legs and she was dark and she wore African fabric tied around her head.  She wore bracelets all down her arms and she did African dance and she boldly stepped out into the dance world and said here I is.
Speaker 1: So this is 1965--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and--
Speaker 1: --sixty-four [1964], '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and sh- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now the Pearl Primus we see in photos, now (unclear) is of a figure, athletic, very athletic woman flying through the air.
Speaker 2: That's right that's the famous picture of her jumping in the air in that big stance.
Speaker 1: There are several like that.
Speaker 2: Several.
Speaker 1: So at this stage had she gained weight, or why was she?
Speaker 2: No she was like that's who it was, but--her build and the reason I say that and describe her that way is that she was the complete opposite of what the modern dancers and the ballet dancers looked like which was very thin, anorexic looking.  You know no, not any fat on them at all and here was this woman that was so completely opposite from that but more than that here is a woman who was completely in tune with her psychic self, nonnegotiable with anybody.  Who stood in a room--stood in that room and said my name Pearl Primus and I am an African dancer--finished.  She didn't feel there was any need to explain herself, to apologize, you know, she just--that was how she started--okay, let's go.  That woman when I saw her I said oh my god I can do it because she, here she was doing it. Then other part that blew my mind was she also was a scholar because Pearl Primus was going into medicine and she got sidetracked in this dance class.  And she trained as a modern dancer and then went to Africa and did all this African research but she you know her--the dances she did in the '60s [1960s] were 'Strange Fruit' and stuff like that.  She was right in the Civil Rights Movement with the Odettas [HistoryMaker Odetta Gordon] and everybody.  And Pearl taught a class that just defied everything that I had heard about what dance was supposed to be.  And she brought me back to what I had seen as a child, and she validated it for me.  That woman will never know, well she knows now she's an ancestor because I talk about her all the time.  The way she moved me into my inner most self and validated me is a gift that I could never pay--there's no money in the world I could pay anybody for that.  She made me realize that, how important dance could be in the life of a child who didn't have anybody around them to give them that and that began to be the seed for me.  I didn't know what it was going to be yet.  But that's--and then when I found out that she had, was a researcher that she went and researched and she went to college [Hunter College, New York, New York], and she studied and then later on I found out that she, when she got her Ph.D. [from New York University, New York, New York], she danced her thesis.  And I thought, unbelievable, this woman.
Story_ID: 446602
Speaker 1: And then in comes [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham, and here is another black woman who now is the complete opposite from Pearl [Pearl Primus], light skinned, but who would not negotiate her colored-ness.  Who said I'm light but I'm black and she went the Caribbean route, Haiti.  Pearl went the African route with the 'Fanga' [Pearl Primus].  But these two women, I was stuck in the middle of the two of them.  Looking at both of them going, my god, I can be all of this; I can be all of this.  And then when I saw the academic level of the work they were doing, Katherine was writing grants and getting funded and writing articles and then now there is this huge amount of legacy this woman has left of her written works that go back to the '40s [1940s] and Pearl you know it just--. And then in steps Lavinia Williams, who was one of the dancers in Katherine's company and was her right hand.  Lavinia became mu- became very accessible to me.
Speaker 2: Now was she--let's kind of put this in, I guess in the context of biography.  When did, did you, when did you meet Katherine Dunham?
Speaker 1: I met Katherine--I had taken, the first time I had actually, actually really physically met her and got a chance to sit near her and take a class from her was at the--in East St. Louis [Illinois], when we did the--well there was a workshop down in East St. Louis and that's actually where I met the drummer Mor Thiam, who really helped us a lot with building the drum corps and gave us the training mechanism that we used on gym base in Ko-Thi Dance Company is Mor Thiam's technique.
Speaker 2: That's M-O-R capital T-H-I-A-M (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) T-H-I-A-M, um-hm. And she actually brought him from Senegal.  So that's where I met Mor Thiam and, and took the workshop with Dunham and I was ju--
Speaker 2: Now about what year is that?
Speaker 1: That was like in the early '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: So, but you were inspired by her prior to--
Speaker 1: Yeah I was inspired by--
Speaker 2: --you became aware of her.
Speaker 1: --by Katherine from reading about her and then I got a chance to actually meet her.  Then it was later on that I met Lavinia Williams and met a whole 'nother group of people who were actually--you know she was like their guru.  Noel Hall [Noel Nantambu Hall] and Rima Pinnuck [ph.], Thomas Pinnuck [ph.], these were people in New York [New York] who were like studying with Lavinia because Lavinia learned all of the Dunham technique 'cause she was in the company [Katherine Dunham Company] but she branched off and started really doing a lot of the Haitian dance form and started teaching it and became known as a specialist in Haitian dance.  And then Noel Hall studied with her, in fact she pretty much gave him all of her knowledge before she passed, and we then commissioned Noel Hall to come to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and he choreographed a--we call it 'Suite Lavinia,' S-U-I-T-E, but S-W-E-E-T Lavinia.  And it's a whole, it's a whole show that's forty-five minutes long of just the Haitian dance pantheon and he gave that all to us.  So we have the lineage now through the choreography and the repertoire of--from Noel, from Lavinia to Katherine, Haiti, you know.
Story_ID: 446603
Speaker 1: That's why dance companies are so important because that's what made me connect to the dance, not just because I wanted to just quote dance, I was drawn to the art of dance specifically because I saw it as a way to implement history as a tool.  We call it a mnemonic device, okay, is that the drumming and the dance are mnemonic devices that stimulate memory.  And see the problem with us as a people in this hemisphere, and Africans who've been under colonialism, is we, we don't have ancestral memory; it's been stripped of us.  I don't know a people or a culture of people who survive or a culture that survives that is stripped of its ancestral legacies.  And to me that's what's the most--that's what at stake here for us as a people is that we're not really connected that way.  And if you look at the demise of any culture in the history of the world, including the Roman Empire when they started losing their, you know, their aesthetic options and their aesthetic methodologies and their definitions of themselves as Romans, that was the end of their empire; it was gone, it was gone.  So as a people what makes the Jewish--what makes Jews survive is that their kids go to school Monday through Friday but on Saturdays they're in the temple and they're learning all about Jewish history and what happened to them and why it happened to them and they're learning their religious ethics and they're reading and--in Hebrew.  They are being taught ancient things so that Jewish children grow up very aware of what it means to be a Jew in a, in a non-Jewish environment they know what that means and they know where home is.  And that's what's killing our communities is we don't know where home is anymore.  Home is Kmart, home is going to the store to buy a new Lexus, home is a joint, home is crack cocaine, home is alcohol, home to a lot of our children is sex, to a lot of our girls, home is having baby after baby after baby with no planning of what they are going to do with their future.  That is--that's the definition of home and a society that's functioning like that is, is on the precipice of annihilation.
Story_ID: 446604
Speaker 1: Okay now I'm going to take you back, University of Wisconsin-Madison [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] (laughter).  So you were inspired by Pearl Primus.  When you we- when you got to the University of Wisconsin there was a fellow teaching primitive dance (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Primitive dance.
Speaker 1: Now how did, how did that work, did you take the primitive dance course?
Speaker 2: Of course I did 'cause it was the only thing around, and he was teaching some kind of pseudo African something.  I don't know what the hell it was, and, but it was the best thing he could do and I give him kudos for the fact that he was teaching it 'cause he'd taken some classes from Pearl Primus and some other people.  It was a quasi between modern and African.  This same individual later called me and was doing a second addition on a book called 'The Dance Experience' ['The Dance Experience: Insights into History, Culture, and Creativity,' Myron Howard Nadel]. The first edition didn't have any--all they talked about was ballet and jazz and modern; didn't talk about dances with people of color.  The second edition they decided to be inclusive, so he invited different people to write on different, other aspects of forms and asked me would I write a chapter on African dance and I did and it's called "Divine Motion" ["African Dance: Divine Motion"].  It's a second edition of 'The Dance Experience.'  Editor--publisher--editor was Myron H. Nadel [Myron Howard Nadel].  Now, when I took that class, it was another class that pushed me into this thing that I knew I needed to do--which was a class called The Arts of Man.  I sat there through that course in Madison [Wisconsin] waiting for when we were going to talk about the arts from those men in the continent of Africa and it didn't happen.  Until we hit this white man called Picasso [Pablo Picasso] and it talked about the father of cubism and then they flashed this picture of his where he has these four prostitutes he was painting in his cubist--and it was kind of--it wasn't cubism.  There were three women and then there was a fourth there was an outline and during the time he was painting this he went to Paris [France] and he saw an exhibit on African masks and anybody who knows anything about African masks knows that Africans have always understood cubism (laughter).  African masks have always taken a breast and put in the middle of the nose and the nose under the armpit, you know what I'm saying? Have always shifted the body parts around or taken a body and flattened it and abstracted it out.  You look at the masks you can see it.  Okay, where there is distortion of a certain part of the body or whatever.  Well when he went to that exhibit he got blown away by it.  He was not--he was offended by the sexuality of it and he was offended by the smell of you know of the masks, I'm sure it had that kind of earthiness of the smell I was talking about.  But his psyche was disrupted and so he goes back in the studio and he takes the fourth prostitute that he's painting and he flattens her.  And he starts doing angular stuff with the nose and making it big and all this kind of stuff, father of cubism slash stolen from Africa (laughter), concept stolen from Africa.  He admits it in his autobiography that Africa influenced him.
Speaker 1: So rather than being the neighbor of cuism--of cubism he becomes the father (laughter)--
Speaker 2: But isn't that the way it always is.
Story_ID: 446605
Speaker 1: See I--my vision as an ar- this is when I started formulating myself as an artist because I made a conscious decision as a child of the '60s [1960s], I know I've always been kind of you know upstart which that's by other people's definition because I think it's rather interesting that when, as soon as black people assert ourselves as whole people, we get labeled as upstarts.  We get labeled as troublemakers, revolutionaries or, as I have been called, arrogant, okay.  You're arrogant when you are whole, well rounded person of color.  You have a sense of entitlement because you think that the world owes you respect, how about that, how about that.  When I stand up and say to the world like Pearl Primus did that day I went in her class, here I is, let's dance, and I'm like, wow.  Pearl Primus didn't have a sense of entitlement, she was Pearl Primus, no explanations necessary.  [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham didn't have a sense of entitlement; she was Katherine Dunham no explanations necessary.  Cab Calloway didn't have a sense of entitlement, Paul Robeson didn't have a sense of entitlement and we can just go on down this list.  Bill "Bojangles" Robinson who taught Shirley, Shirley, little cute little--
Speaker 2: Temple, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Temple [Shirley Temple] every step she knew and who was a classy man who the only way that he could be projected on the screen was to be a butler and a servant.  This is, this is outrageous history and I teach this in my classes because we have to get people to understand what are--who we are as a people.  None of these people had a sense of entitlement; they were who they were.  And so I decided that's what I want to instill and that's my mission as a dancer.
Speaker 2: Okay so, so did you major in--
Speaker 1: I majored in dance--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and, but I wanted, but I knew that the anthropological strain of this was going to become--. And I don't like the term anthropological strain, I don't know why I'm using it because if you study African dance you are studying history, culture, aesthetic, art, language.  Call it anthropology, whatever you want to call it, you're studying all of that because--and that's what Katherine Dunham discovered when she went to Haiti.  She went on a Guggenheim fellowship to just research dance and she found out, oh my god she had to go get in the Vodun and came out a mambo, a high priest because that's where the dance is.  So our preachers tell my dancers who are trying to come into my company you shouldn't go over there because it's pagan.  How ignorant is that because I think that if Jesus was on the planet--I--first of all I believe he is here but he's not in the shape that people want to admit that he might be in.  I believe the spirit of that being that was on this planet represents himself very, in very unusual formats, okay.  And so, so therefore to me to transcend from a drum and to the spirit mount me and transcend me into a better human being is his ideology at work.  So for a preacher to tell me or my dancers that what I do is anti-God and pagan is heresy.  It's heresy against your own culture and your own people.  It's heresy against your legacy of your history, it's heresy against yourself.  And see when we start heresy against ourselves individually that's when the end is near.
Story_ID: 446606
Speaker 1: You're in school '64 [1964], well '65 [1965]--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) through--?
Speaker 2: Well I switched, I stayed up in Madison [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] for a year and a-half and almost flunked out of school because I couldn't handle it.  I was an angry college student.  We had (laughter), we had an organization on campus called P- P-O-P, POP, right?  It was all the black students on campus; it was called POP, People Organized for Partying [ph.] (laughter).  It was structured partying because we spent--you know during that time we spent a lot of time philo- philosophizing because Malcolm X was walking the planet during that time.  You know what I'm saying and we had the Panther Party [Black Panther Party] walking the planet during that time and people were poeting all over.  You went to parties you know what I'm talking about.  We went to parties and poets would get up and poet and people were you know just--it was a, such a--it was like a new, like the Harlem Renaissance it was that version of it.
Speaker 1: Were there any black teachers at University of Wisconsin-Madison then that were influential or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were, but I didn't get any--no, if there were I didn't get any of them in the classes I was in because I was only there like the freshmen year and most of those were those huge massive classes of five hundred people and I got lost in all of that.  I couldn't function in a lecture where there's four hundred people in the lecture, I just could not function.  So I, I moved to Milwaukee [Wisconsin], UWM [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee] and came back home because I was flunking out of school, you know.
Speaker 1: So this is '65 [1965] you come to UWM?
Speaker 2: Yeah in '65 [1965] and--well it was like '66 [1966] through there and worked as a--studied modern dance and that's when I went through a shift because then I ran into this man his choreography and his name was Alvin Ailey.  I went to see the Alvin Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] and I saw them do, I saw [HistoryMaker] Judith Jamison do 'Cry' [Alvin Ailey] and I cried and I saw all of this rich black pride on stage and these dancers high trained like gazelles.  And I said, oh my god, and you know it was like another eureka for me and I was like, I want to do that.  I want to do that. So I was going to go--I went to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] and auditioned to get in NYU and got in and then that same period (laughter) it's the weir- how life is--that I had gone to do that is when I had an opportunity to go to Ghana and study with the National Dance Company [National Dance Company of Ghana] in Ghana 1969 and I went oh, I've got to go back to Ghana.
Speaker 1: So you were at NYU.
Speaker 2: Yeah that was--
Speaker 1: Did you enroll at NYU?
Speaker 2: I didn't enroll; I had gone just to the audition process--
Speaker 1: Oh, you went to the audition.
Speaker 2: Right, to get into the school, and had been told that I had a really good chance of getting in.  And was--if that call hadn't come about this experience in Ghana, I probably would have ended up in New York [New York] and I was a sharp little modern dancer at the time.  I had all the extensions and I wa- had had very good training, had ballet training and everything and I think I could have made it if I'd auditioned in the Ailey company.  You know, I'm not su- who knows, it doesn't matter you know whether I would have gotten in or not, it doesn't matter because that wasn't the road that the ancestors had for me.
Story_ID: 446607
Speaker 1: So that was a goal then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Anyway--it was a goal at that time--
Speaker 1: --to go to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] then get involved with the Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater].
Speaker 2: --to go to NYU, and I just wanted to be in New York [New York] because I knew that there was so much going on and there were so many classes to take and people--
Speaker 1: Well, how did the Ghanaian--how did it come about, I mean had you applied for, or--a grant?
Speaker 2: Well the Ghanaian thing was through the Institute for African Studies [Accra, Ghana] it was called and I had run across it, ran into this and applied for a grant and got a chance to go for six weeks and unbelievable experience.  I got to work with two of the most outstanding scholars on dance and music and drumming in Ghana, Dr. Opoku [Albert Mawere Opoku] and Dr. Nketia--O-P-O-K-U, and Dr. Nketia [J.H. Kwabena Nketia], N-K-E-T-I-A and John Jantuah [John Kofi Jantuah], Ja- J-A-N-T-U-A-H.  He was the lead male dancer with the National Dance Company of Ghana.
Speaker 1: So is he related to Kofi Jantuah who is now in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, I don't know, that's a very popular name over there but I don't know if that's the same person (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Kofi Jantuah came over with the National Dance Company of Ghana in '64 [1964] (unclear) World's Fair--
Speaker 2: Then it might be, he may be even calling himself--well but this guy wouldn't have been in the World's Fair so that's probably an elder of his.
Speaker 1: Yeah they have Jantuah dance company in Chicago--
Speaker 2: Yeah that's the same John Jantuah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's who I studied with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, that experience really again was another eureka moment because I was working with the National Dance Company, we were--I was hanging out with them.  We would rehearse in the mornings and take class, sit down and we'd have communal lunch and then we'd get back into the studio and then I'd go back up while the other people who were on the trip were actually doing things like you know going in their areas, social sciences, history and whatever.  I was doing the dance part of it and went on a field trip to Elmina Castle [Elmina, Ghana].
Story_ID: 449787
Speaker 1: This is Ghana 1965, right?
Speaker 2: In '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969] okay that's right '69 [1969].  So y- all right, so where did you go in Ghana when you went over there?
Speaker 2: Well I stayed at the University of Legon [University of Ghana at Legon, Accra, Ghana]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that's where we did all of the American Forum for Interna- for African Studies [sic. Institute for African Studies, Accra, Ghana] is where we all basically stayed.  But like I said I spent most of my time with the National Dance Company [National Dance Company of Ghana] with John Jantuah [John Kofi Jantuah] and all of those guys.  And what happened was we went on a couple of field trips.  We went to the village where they make the Kente cloth, and then we went to what was to be another eureka riveting moment for me was to Elmina Castle [Elmina, Ghana].  And you know you read about these touchstones, these ancient sights or significant religious, spiritual sights and we read about slavery and the Middle Passage, but it does not hit you until you go to one of the slave forts.  And you, you go through the tour and they take into what was the holding pen and then they take you down the tunnel into the second holding pen, which usually is very damp and dark and moist and you can--you touch the walls and you just crumble spiritually, you cry.  It's like--it's going into a church.  You know it's a very spiritual--it's more spiritual to me than any church I've ever been into actually to tell the truth in terms of how it touched me on a spiritual level and then you see the doors that they used to--that were watertight un- while the tide came in the ships would come in and when the tide went out they'd open the doors and they would walk the slaves through the mud onto the ships and then when the tide came back out then they would sail off.  And what was interesting to me about that trip was, the whole time I was in Ghana I was, you know and like I said at the time I could have gone--there was a fork in the road.  I could have gone the African route or I could have gone to Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] and you know the modern thing.  So I was not sure what direction I wanted to go in. I knew it was going to be dance but I wasn't sure what idiom I was going to be following, and I was having a lot of issues and anger with the educational system that I had received at that point up 'til then because I felt there was too much missing.  There was so much of our history that was omitted.  I believed and I still believe that it was and is a conspiracy to do that you know as a means of control of people of color.  And I went to what would be considered the famous, the door of no return and--you look through that door and you realize that the slaves who looked through that door into the Atlantic Ocean were going into territory, had no idea that they had already been psychologically traumatized, separated from their families, their wives.  In the fort there were rooms where they told us women were separated that the masters could have their way with and they were thrown back down into the pit.  And I know that there are Americans in this country you know when we talk about what happened in World War II [WWII] to the Jews there are people who still deny that occurred even with the photography and the film documentation.  So you know they don't recognize what happened to us because all we have are drawings.  We have slave captain accounts but that's not even believable enough.  We don't--you know, this is the age where nothing is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they're not heard.
Speaker 2: --the age of reality shows--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not heard.
Speaker 2: Right.  So if it's not on video somewhere, nobody believes it.  If you don't see it on TV nobody believes it.
Story_ID: 449788
Speaker 1: It was standing there at that door [at Elmina Castle, Elmina, Ghana], as trite as this might sound because it sounds like a Hollywood-y thing, but there is a definite shift in your being when you stand there and you look out over the ocean and you realize what happened to us, and you cry, and you weep and you cry, you heave and you want to throw up.  You have all of these feelings, your stomach is in a knot, you have pain in your back, your head hurts, you're sweating profusely.  Everything is happening to you, it's almost--you're almost feeling like you're going to die.  You almost feel like you're just going to die from the hurt and the pain to realize what happened to us.  And then you come out of that and I came out of that with--I--because the tour guide--what I found interesting was that as he was telling us all of this detail, he was doing it completely detached, this is a Ghanaian.  He, he had learned this as a script (laughter) and he was talking to a group of African Americans, there were some white people in the mix, but majority African Americans who were all standing there weeping, and he was telling us this whole horrendous thing, process of what happened to Africans in this slavery fort, but he was detached from the story.  And it was almost as if he didn't recognize that the people who were standing there weeping and moaning and falling apart could have been his brother or sister.  So, that's when I said, I know what I want to do with my dance, is I want to go back to America and create a dance company that will tell this story in a multiplicity of ways to connect African Americans to their home presence and history and legacy and at the same time find a way to connect the African connection back on the other side so that they would boomerang like this (gesture).  And that the dance would become the mechanism to do this and that became, that became my mission and everything I do in my classes--and it's not just for black people because this is another revelation I had is that for only us to know us is a mistake.  The Jews realized that their salvation and safety in the world against the Nazis was going to have to be the world's acknowledgement of what happened to them.  And so they went on a mission not only as a three-pronged mission which was not only with themselves, the ones who survived the Holocaust was to tell their stories, the second prong was to make sure that the young people coming up heard the stories and put it into context and the third was to make sure that everybody who is a non-Jew understood what happened to them.  That was very important, very crucial to the survival of Jewish culture was to make sure the whole world knows what happened to them.  We have not taken that part of it seriously enough.  I love Spike Lee because that's what he kept trying to do but the community does not support those filmmakers who try to do that.  Black folks won't go to see that, we don't want to, it's too painful.  How can you say it's too painful to go and support that which tells your story?  Yeah, it's painful, but that's all the more reason why you need to embrace the pain and you need to tell the story of the pain 'cause if you don't do that then it will dissipate and disappear and you become cultureless, history less, non-human species.  So that became my, my objective as an artist and that's when I said, okay, I'm going to put my foot in the door of the university system because not only do I want to teach black kids, I want to teach everybody about the dance of our people and the story of our people through dance because you can tell the story of black people from the Middle Passage to the new world to the Caribbean whether it's Cuba, Santeria, whether it's Haiti, Vodun, whether it's Brazil, Candomble, the African spirit is present--
Story_ID: 449789
Speaker 1: What I've heard you say now is that it wasn't necessarily the dances of Ghana that, that was profound, but the, the realization of what our history was.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the need to tell that story.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so then it became a mission to study all these different dance forms of Africa and put them--and then, then the vision became now what will happen if I took--if we took as a concept the boot dance from South Africa the Isicathulo, which we now see as called stepping in the fraternities and we hooked that up to tap dance.  You see, what would happen if we took the ring shout of the Carolinas and we hooked that up to the early southern Baptist movement in the church and then hooked that up to the Haitian Vodun?  You know, so then I started seeing very huge possibilities in terms of using dance as a means to show all of us our connectors to each other in the diaspora and that's what we try to do in our concerts.  They are themed; they are built out and themed to show these connections.  We just did a thing with Samuel Jason Smith [sic. Jason Samuels Smith], and he's an international tap star, and we took a South African boot dance form and smudged it with what he was doing and brought out some sabar drummers and there's a section in there where it's just the two sabar drummers on either side of him answering call and response with tap.  It's a revolutionary thought but not so--it's revolutionary for some people, but it's a very old concept in terms of how Africans see--.  Because I'm saying if our imagery can influence a Picasso [Pablo Picasso], why can't we influence each other through the diaspora and reconnect ourselves to ourselves.  Why, why is African art always the stimulator for somebody else, like 'Stomp,' or whoever is running around making all this money, this dance company.  They are wonderful, they play with brooms and garbage cans and lids and they do great inventive stuff.  A lot of the rhythms they have learned from going to South Africa.  See, and we're always feeding everybody, but we don't feed ourselves. And that's what has to change.
Story_ID: 449790
Speaker 1: When you came back from Ghana you founded Ko-Thi [Ko-Thi Dance Company], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, same year.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us how did you--all right.  And how did you choose the name and how was it set up, how did you do it?
Speaker 2: Well I started--well the name came about, the whole time I was in Ghana and kind of fly- flying back home that whole flight I was writing and then it occurred to me that what this was really about was to seek and search and discover the root and then to train artists to be able to expansively develop that into connective tissue.  Right 'cause--rather than just say I'm a Senegalese dancer or I'm a Ghanaian dancer you could say wow I specialize in Senegalese but I also know Haitian and I know Cuban and I--and seeing the connectors.  So, in my father's [Solomon Brooks Caulker] language thi is black, T-H-I and ko, ko, or ko is go.  So I put the two together Ko-Thi means go black as in to seek, search, find, discover.  Go as an active word: to go somewhere.  So that's, that's how that came about for me.
Speaker 1: I like that (laughter). So, so, the company was founded, now did you--did you know, were there dancers here [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] already involved in African dance--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were, there were--
Speaker 1: --or did you have to start from scratch and build--
Speaker 2: Well, first of all when you start a dance company I have to say this to everybody you're always starting from scratch (laughter) because dancers are like revolving doors; they come in and out.  If you're lucky you'll have a bunch of them who will stick with you because they love the vision and the image, and I've been blessed to have people who've been in the company ten, fifteen, twenty years.  The pain and anxiety of that is that they should now be able to work and do this full-time as a living and that's a whole other conversation when we talk about the demise of our institutions not being able to reach forty 'cause you cannot institutionalize if you are not able to provide a living wage for your people.  Okay?  So that's a whole other discussion but when I started this company there were a lot of just like all over the country everybody was doing African something 'cause this was right out of the '60s [1960s].  You know, this is dashiki, afro era and everybody was playing rhythms, you know.  I mean, they weren't traditional African rhythms because we didn't have access to the Africans yet you know who were coming over and actually teaching them, I mean Olatunji [Babatunde Olatunji] was out there.  But we didn't really have like now which really I'd say around the '80s [1980s] we started having a lot of you know like Camara [Yamoussa Camara] and people like that who started coming in and actually introducing specific drum rhythms that were from a specific era.  In other words we were playing generic rhythms, and then gradually we became exposed to specificity in terms of, okay there is sabar, there's bata, you see what I'm saying? Then we started realizing there's a family of batas, there is a family of sabar, there's and you know there's all these other fontomfrom from Ghana.  There's all these--Congolese have their--boogalaboos [ph.], and all these different families of drums and families of rhythms and families of dance styles that go together and we've got thousands of them.
Story_ID: 449791
Speaker 1: Did you know Melvin Deal--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in those days?
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because I know he, his style is primarily Akan, you know--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --fontomfrom with the hook sticks and all that.
Speaker 2: Right, he did mostly the Ghanaian style, and you know because there was him, there was Chuck Davis doing Senegalese, there was Charles Moore doing mostly Caribbean, there was the Caribbean gro-.  This country was full during that time of the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s].  When Ko-Thi [Ko-Thi Dance Company] started, I was just one of many companies that were doing this.
Speaker 1: Well they were all new pretty much.
Speaker 2: Yeah and we all started about the same time.  The tragedy is so many of those aren't around anymore, or the Chuck Davis is still around, but we shape shifted ourselves you know what I mean.  But it's, it's, it's interesting that era of the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s] created this nucleus of directors, who we all kind of latched on to a particular vision an aspect of the continent, and then we just expounded on that which left a huge legacy, but the problem is, nobody really absorbed it, really funded it.  And the companies who survived as institutions were the Alvin Aileys [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] and those companies who interestingly enough were all doing basically balletic--doing afro ballet modern, and also integrated their companies and became the American--Alvin Ailey American Theater Company [sic.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Dance Theater, right.
Speaker 2: You see what I'm saying?  And so now all of a sudden it's another kind of acceptance, but it's still under the acceptability of mainstream; they had to shape shift.  And those of us who were trying to be authentic were still (gesture)--'cause for a long time the National Endowment of the Arts [sic. National Endowment for the Arts] and a lot of funding, we were still in the category of folk dance and not considered quote dance companies.
Speaker 1: Or Expansion Arts which was even a smaller (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, there you go, that's how we got our first funding was through the Expansion Arts.  We weren't in the main league dance company funding 'cause we weren't considered that, and so this has been an ongoing struggle to legitimize this form as authentic in terms of what we're trying to document, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 449792
Speaker 1: How did you form, how did assemble your dancers? Were the people already here involved in African dance on some level, or did you have to train them all from scratch or how did you do it?
Speaker 2: It was both, it was both.  I, I, I started off the way most dance companies start off is you have somebody who's, who is a teacher who has an idea for a philosophy and a concept, starts throwing down some classes.  And then the natural progression out of the classes is you take the students who are in your classes and you put together some kind of mini-show. And what happened with Ko-Thi [Ko-Thi Dance Company] was very simple actually.  I'm like actually stunned sometimes when I think about it because there was no plan per se until ten years after we'd been working--that's when I made a conscious decision to turn it into a real serious dance company, okay.  But the first ten years really we started just doing shows and people would see the shows and say you know we want you guys to come to our school and our educational outreach was what the company became, was an educational tool and put together a format that we're still using that we call Drumtalk.  This format has great flexibility in terms of what it can do in a school, in terms of going into geography.  We've had residencies in schools that would just blow your mind in terms of we'll go in and talk to the principal and the principals and the teachers will decide that you know this whole week that you all are here we're going to focus on Africa.  We went one time to a school where each room--each classroom took a part of Africa, and that's all they focused on, and then we came in and did the whole movement thing, and it was awesome because you walk down the halls and--. I mean from the minute you entered the school it was Africa for the whole week.  To me that was when a light went on for me.  This was twenty years ago 'cause we're thirty-eight years old now so that's twenty, thirty years ago.  We do social science, geography, history, music, song, dance and fitness and health and learning group work dynamics.  How, how to work with one and other, how to, how to see yourself in space you know what I'm saying 'cause that's a whole different way of communicating in the world when you learn dance as a form in a classroom because it teaches you how to negotiate space.  And that's really important in the workplace, you know.  So if you never danced again in your whole life you go into a job you have to learn how to negotiate space, boundaries.  How do you work with other people who are different from you, how do you communicate you know to other people?  The arts teach that, that's the benefit of that, so it's for everybody.  And so that's, that's was the essence of Ko-Thi Dance Company.  So to preserve, promulgate, teach and give children experience and audiences and experiences--that's two-pronged, one is the actual physical experience in class the second one is the experience as an audience because those two things have to occur, you know. And it's the audience building that is the hardest you know for our community, for those of us who are in these forms.
Story_ID: 449793
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979] was a pivotal time period for Ko-Thi [Ko-Thi Dance Company], a period of change (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'd say '69 [1969]--'79 [1979], yeah that year was when because you asked me where the dancers came from.  Some of them had been in dance clubs and you know there was a group called Nefertari [Nefertari African Dance Company] here in town [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] that was, that was a group of dancers that was out of a hi- a school--Sarah Grant and a school called North Division High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And they were doing African dance and so when I started the company but my vision was that I wanted t- it was that ten year period that was conscious that I didn't want this to just stay as a club.  I didn't want it to be a folk dance club and that's when I went to New York [New York] and hung out at the Ailey school [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, New York, New York], went and met with Rod Rodgers and started actually--I actually stayed in New York for periods of time of one week to ten days at a time during that '70s [1970s] through the first part of the '80s [1980s]. And I would go in there and Rod would--I would follow him around (laughter) you know to his meetings.  He basically really mentored me in a beautiful way because I would sit and watch his rehearsals, I would go to his meetings, I would sit in his staff meetings, I would spend the day watching him doing what he was doing in terms of running his company.  Rod Rodgers was really very unique in that he had a very keen sense of business.  He had a natural business sense and so when I had gone to the Ailey school I was like checking it out.  I went and sat literally--I went and sat in the aisle in the hallway and checked out how their business office was running, you know, and I went to museums and I checked out what was in the museums and how people were kind of managing the flow of things.  And I--and following Rod around that's what gave me the business sense that I have in terms of how I wanted to put this, this, this--change this dance group from a folk dance company to a just a kind of group from a folk dance--or from a dance group into a professional entity.  And created a board of directors and we did the 501(c)(3) business and then started writing grants, and then I--what taught me--I think what pushed Ko-Thi from being a folk dance company into a professional company was the concept of how we mount our shows.  The standard that was expected of how we produce what we produce, whether it's going into the schools or whether it's workshops.  It's how--what is our professional demeanor as we approach a building, you know. Training the dancers and the musicians like this is the way you dress when we go into a school, this is the way you carry yourself when you're in a meeting, this is the way you negotiate--again going back to the concept of space and time.  How do you manipulate and move forward into--as a professional?  Because what I discovered was, we had a lot of talented people, but they didn't know how to negotiate themselves in those kind of environments.  It's the transition into professionalism.  And so that's, that's what we have been working on in our company all these years and now we're looking at turning forty in 2009, and it's about institution building and legacy--leaving a legacy.  And that means now you know trying to raise an endowment, trying to have a building, trying to set salaries so that those people who have been with you a long time can now do this as a living.  They- they're not dancing anymore, they've become the teachers, they've become the managers.  You know that's when you're building an institution and that's where we run into problems as black organizations because that's when our neighborhoods and our communities don't come through for us.  I mean Dance Theatre Harlem [Dance Theatre of Harlem] is basically dead.  And I mean they were created the same year as Ko-Thi, 1969 so Dance Theatre Harlem and Ko-Thi in 2009 are going to hit forty and both of us are holding on like this on the edge.  Very few black organizations, aesthetic organizations--we have an organization here called the black, the Black Holocaust Museum [America's Black Holocaust Museum, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and can you tell me for the life of me why that organization is barely making it? (Pause) That's the scary part.
Story_ID: 446753
Speaker 1: We were talking about 1979 being a pivotal juncture in terms of the professionalism of the group [Ko-Thi Dance Company].  But let me ask you this, I was wondering this as you were talking about the beginning of this, I know Milwaukee [Wisconsin] like a lot of other black cities or urban you know with a large black population have a lot of different cultural forces going on--did--was the topographical research center [Black Peoples Topographical Research Center] here?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Because I know they were really big on Akan culture.
Speaker 2: Yes, that group had a major influence on me also.  I usually don't mention it in interviews because it scares people.
Speaker 1: Well people don't even know what it is.
Speaker 2: They don't even know what it is, but we can just say this, that those brothers, everything that they said was going to happen is happening.  They were right on target, and I knew it when I would hear the presentations, and it's a shame that so many of our political leaders, okay, have not been committed enough, or they're scared or whatever it is and I don't mind saying this out in public.  I am very discouraged with our black political leadership in this city.  Not across the board, but just, I'm talking through a span of thirty years of people who have been put in positions, or have been given the opportunity to really do something for our communities and who have instead filled their individual pockets instead of working for the betterment of the community.  That has been disturbing to me because what was described in the topographical society--you know it's not like we--a lot of the leadership was there in those rooms during that time.  So, they got the same information I got, and I don't see how we can sit consciously and see all of this played out from city--from urban community to urban community to urban community and not see what is happening because it is systematic, and it's not an accident what is going on.  You know we call it now--new words keep coming up now its re-gentrification.  What that means is black folks--poor folks have all been moved out and put into another ghetto somewhere far away and all the downtown areas, which used to be ghettos, are now re-gentrified with rent that the average person can't afford to be in.  You know and so--and then we're building theaters in communities and malls and clubs and all this stuff to keep that group--so they don't have to go anywhere to be entertained in their own little tight little space and the, the problems have been moved out into the suburban areas into little ghettos, and it's happening everywhere.  So it's not an accident, and the topographical society had those charts and things all mapped out, I saw them.  So how can our leadership who were present in some of those meetings who are now mayors and supervisors and aldermen you know live with themselves?  I don't get it.
Story_ID: 446754
Speaker 1: Milwaukee [Wisconsin] has a, a spoken word tradition too, and I was thinking of Tejumalah [ph.] and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and there is a group of poets here that are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, Quavina [ph.], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And Element [Element C. Everest], yes, know all of them.
Speaker 1: So how do you, how do you--now, from what you were describing Ko-Thi [Ko-Thi Dance Company] philosophy of theater seems to be a lot like what [HistoryMaker] Paul Carter Harrison talks about when he talks about black theater being a combination of visual art, dance and the spoken word.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and we've done, just recently did a show with and I want to do more of that.  The Ko-Thi that I see now going into 2009 and 2010--'08 [2008], '09 [2009] and '10 [2010] is going to have poets--poetry more with us, it's going to deal with the spoken word more because we have to go back to our griot heritage, you know, and the fact is we come from a culture inherently where we don't separate the arts you know into dance, music or whatever. That there--that it is all one thing.  They are all mnemonic devices and I think we need to go back to that and I think the black church has always understood that.  The black church--the preacher is the griot of our community in a different kind of way but he's always understood the theater and the drama of playing that, you know, the call and response.  They are masters at that, and I think that what we have to do as artists is become more--we have to study how the preachers function because that's what we're going to have to do to build that connective tissue back into our communities.  Because they're ma- they're getting people to tithe to their churches and building megachurches and million dollar complexes and the black arts are sitting, suffering on the edge so something is wrong here.  So my whole thing is that I've studied what the black preachers are doing, and I'm saying to my, my donor base hey you don't need to give me a thousand dollars in a year--I mean now, how about we spread that out and you tithe to me for a year.  So if I can get three hundred of my community, okay, to say they're going to give Ko-Thi twenty dollars a month for the next three years, I've got an income each month that is stable that I can now build a planning culture on, to build a base from which I can build that building, put some people on salary, use as matching funds.  We have to go back to that because the majority of our people are not conscious enough to think about dropping--you know I don't see anybody dropping a mi- nobody dropped a million dollars on Dance Theatre Harlem [Dance Theatre of Harlem] and that's why they are in the trouble they're in.  [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham died with no money what an atrocity is that.  Lavinia Williams died with no money, Chief Bey [James Hawthorne] died with no money, Bill "Bonjangles" Robinson died penniless gave all of his money away to helping his people, walking down the street and somebody would say I ain't got no rent money and he took money out of his pocket and gave it to people, he had no money when he died.  Sammy Davis, Jr., other people paid for his funeral, he didn't have any money. M.C. Hammer ran out of money. You know, we're just not thinking, and we need to be thinking about building institutions and maintaining those institutions.
Story_ID: 446755
Speaker 1: That's what we need to be doing, so that you know we have something to show the world beyond our children filling up the prison system.  You know because when I hear that the way they project the next prison they are going to build is by the dropout rate of fourth graders, I find that an atrocity, and we should not be willing to accept that as the formula, it's not acceptable.
Speaker 2: Yeah it seems a little backward doesn't it to--
Speaker 1: Well, it's not backward if you have another intent, which is to create a workforce that's under your total control because we know that going to China and everywhere else and having them do the cheap labor ain't going to last forever so we better build a cheap labor here and guess what it's the prison system and guess who is the majority in the prison system?  So we're building another slave culture, and it's mostly kids who have come out--they're illiterate, you know what I'm saying, our neighborhoods are falling apart, the families are falling apart.  It's a whole lot of reasons why that's occurring, we have contributed into that.  I'm not putting this on mainstream, we have contributed and our politicians and our preachers and everybody, we- I'm guilty; we're all guilty because we have played into it.
Speaker 2: Okay. So what you're basically giving us are your hopes and concerns for the African American community going forward.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it concerns me because in travelling I went on to Fulbright [Fulbright Fellowship] to Tanzania and I see the same--I have a vision and this blew my mind and it disturbed me and it still disturbs me of seeing the Maasai people, an honorable, noble people, you know, whose whole culture has been moved now until like we did with the Native American Indian you know in terms of tourism has taken over so that now they put up little villages that are fake villages for the tourists to come to and they put on their little thing and then they go and live in poverty.  Because they had a whole tradition that was nomadic, well they can't roam anymore.  So you can't take a nomadic people and suddenly turn them into farmers, you kill them, you see.  So you put them on reservations and they become the tourist pictures for everybody on safari, okay.  But what killed me is to go into Arusha in Tanzania and to see young men, not necessarily Maasai, but young Tanzanians between the age of eighteen and twenty-four standing in front of the electronic store just looking at all of the DVD players and CD players and all of the electronic games, and they just stand there for hours.  Jobless, educational-less, tool-less and I looked at that, and it's the saddest picture I've ever seen.  And I see that in our neighborhoods over here, and you can go to Haiti and see the same thing, you can go to Brazil and see the same thing, I don't care where you go, you're going to see droves of young men, you know, hypnotized by the electronic age of 2007 with no opportunity or skill to participate and we wonder why we have so much anger.
Story_ID: 446756
Speaker 1: Let me do this 'cause I'll be remiss if I don't do it and that is to have you review, if you will, you know the highlights of Ko-Thi [Ko-Thi Dance Company] over the years--
Speaker 2: Oh, there's so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the concerts and the themes and some of the ideas--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so I don't know if you can maybe go back chronologically.  I don't want you to do all of them, but if you could do certain--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I could think for sure the advantage, the beautiful advantage of having someone that's been around almost forty years is that you can go back decade by decade.  So I can say the first decade what I would say was a major point for Ko-Thi was building--redefining ourselves out of being a folk dance company to a serious dance company and we started doing a lot of schools and a lot of touring within the state.  I would say that our second decade which took us through the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s] is when we started doing like national touring, and this company has travelled all over the United States and we've received major touring packages from actual states that picked us up as the dance company for the whole state, Ohio, New Jersey where we went seven and eight weeks on tour in Ohio and serviced schools and performed in major performing houses, like equal to the Pabst Theater [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] or Chicago Auditorium [ph.], this company has done those, those houses.  And so that, so those are highlights and then the third decade I would say was when we crossed over and started doing some international work the Mitsui Festival in Japan [Tokyo, Japan], the Toronto [Canada] arts festival.  You know, those, those are highlights and the experience of our company some who have never been on a plane before, let alone international flight, taking young African Americans across--I mean to Japan and Canada.  When we went on the California tour we did New Mexico and California and we left here on a Greyhound tour bus, we drove across the country into New Mexico and did Los Alamos [New Mexico], Santa Fe [New Mexico], you know, all of that and then came down the coast of California and performed and then came back across the U.S. back to Wisconsin from California.  That was an epic moment in Ko-Thi's history, epic because we're all doing that.  Here's this little bitty company with very little money, but we took--and what--we were able to do this because we took twelve artists and put them on salary for eight months out of the year, and we sustained that for like five years, really from 1990 until two, three years ago.  Okay.  We were able to sustain salaries.  We still didn't have health insurance benefits, but we were able to do that and to me that was monumental.  The sadness I feel is that we have not been able to sustain it.
Story_ID: 446757
Speaker 1: You know, we've gone back to now nobody's salaried.  We went to paying wage rates for rehearsal, now this fall company members [in the Ko-Thi Dance Company] were rehearsing one night a week for no pay, just to maintain--so I mean to go backwards like that is a very traumatic--
Speaker 2: Is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and painful thing.
Speaker 2: Now is that due to the decline--
Speaker 1: Drop--
Speaker 2: --in funding--
Speaker 1: --in funding all across the board.
Speaker 2: --by the National Endowment and other--
Speaker 1: National Endowment of the Arts [sic. National Endowment for the Arts], the Wisconsin state arts budget we've gone from being, getting close to 85, $95,000 a year to this year $5,000, under $6,000 funding.  County funding--the county system is broke so there is some funding but it's really smaller.  They have very little, and what happens is the larger groups get, you know, the symphonies and the ballets and mainstream groups get the big chunk of the money, let's face it and that's because in a mainstream city like Milwaukee [Wisconsin] they have to have a ballet and symphony I don't why that--that seems to be the formula in America is that each city if they're going to be a metropolitan city must have a--there's the Dallas Symphony [Dallas Symphony Orchestra] then there's got to be a Chicago Symphony [Chicago Symphony Orchestra]--
Speaker 2: They have to be the European classical forms.
Speaker 1: --there's a Milwaukee Symphony [Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra]. You know there's--
Speaker 2: The European classical forms.
Speaker 1: Right, look at the groups who are in the million dollar budgets, the Milwaukee Symphony; Milwaukee Ballet, Milwaukee Repertory Theater; Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, so if you don't have Milwaukee next to your name, you ain't going to ever make it there.  You know so and why ain't you going to make it because the community does not value that aesthetic unless it's the Eurocentric aesthetic.  That's a fact of life, this is where we live, what's the alternative? Don't do it. And to me that's not an alternative.  So if doing it means we got to go back to the format we had in 1969 then damn it that's what we're going to do.  Because the imperative here has nothing to do with what mainstream Milwaukee or mainstream U.S.A. says should survive.  You know my people did not come over here and suffer what we suffered in the Middle Passage when I stood at that door of no return I keep going back to that.  In their name I testify that you cannot tell me that this form cannot exist in Milwaukee.  It may not have money, and it may not have what you are willing to give, but it will not die, it will have some shape or form in the name and the memory of those people, that's wha- that's what my attitude is.  That will be my last breath because it's too important and my challenge--and I don't want to--Zora Neale Hurston--you know, I ain't study--I don't want to study what white people think about who I am.  I'm sixty years old, I'm not wasting a minute of my life worrying about the definition white people have of me.  What I do worry about at sixty years of age is the definition that my people have of ourselves, that's what--and that's where we need to put our focus you know because if we are to continue to sit and wait for somebody else who has their own aesthetic to support the institutions that represent our history and our legacy and our aesthetic then woo woo on us 'cause there's nobody to blame but us.
Story_ID: 446758
Speaker 1: Of the performances that you all have mounted, which--do you have a favorite or a favorite thing that (unclear) I mean in those performances [by the Ko-Thi Dance Company]?
Speaker 2: You know what my answer always is to that is that I'm a process person; I like the process of the works being created.  The performances are the icing on the cake to me.  It's a bitch to get them mounted (laughter) you know from the budgets to the costume to how you are going to pay the people, the lighting, the designers and all of that.  But I actually like that creative process of getting it up and once it's up it's not yours it's never yours to begin with but it's the dancers that move it.  It's another form once it's up.  You know your work is done as the producer or the choreographer, it's the dancers that take it and move it into this other form and that's the icing on the cake.  'Cause if you don't do the work then you don't have the cake with the icing.  So every show in answer to your question to me is beautemous [ph.], every show is my favorite show, every single one of them.  They are flawed because we're human and it's live theater but that's the nature of it.  Every show is absolutely my favorite.
Story_ID: 446759
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Marry a wealthy man who would support my company [Ko-Thi Dance Company] (laughter).  That was my major error (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well when you look at what you've done to this point today what would you consider your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Oh my god, you know why I have a problem always answering those questions is because I think when you are doing what you're doing and you don't feel like doing it some days but something makes you get up to do it anyway, that that's a calling and I feel that I have been called to do what I'm doing because I don't know why I keep doing it.  Sometimes I'm too tired and something makes me--sometimes I, many times I've wanted to give up and I can't; it won't let me drop it.  You know, there have been so many times that I don't want to do this anymore, I just want to do this anymore, but I get up in the morning or a kid calls me.  I mean just this week one of our young men called me who is working and trying to get his life together and he called me and he said, "Would you do this letter of recommendation for me 'cause I'm trying to get this job." And I said, "Sure will," and I said, "How are you doing?" And he just started talking to me and when we finished I said, "You know you just made my day calling me," and I said, "Do you know I love you?" And he says, "But do you know I love you?"  And he's a kid who came up through the ranks.  That was a day that I was thinking about quitting, and every time I get ready to think that and wonder, have actually psyched myself into I can do this, I can quit this don't you know I get that call or I'll go the little children's rehearsal and one of the little ones will come up and give me a hug and they call me Mama Ferne [HistoryMaker Ferne Yangyeitie Caulker] and I can't quit.  You know they call it founders syndrome or whatever the hell they want to call that founders syndrome means that you are possessed and obsessed with this vision and it becomes beyond the passion, it's a way of life.  It's a way of my life.  So you just--legacy, I don't think of it as a legacy other people will tell me it's a legacy when I'm dead.  Other people will determine it's a legacy, I can't say it's a legacy or not.  If it's a legacy other people will say--I know that Lavinia Williams left a legacy because I keep talking about her.  I know that [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham left a legacy 'cause I keep talking about her and other people do to.  That's how you know you, that's how you know that your legacy is in place because people talk.  There are tools and mnemonic devices that people remember you for many different reasons.  Even the legacy could be people who hate your guts or resented you because you accomplished that they dreamt about but can't do themselves that's also a legacy too.  It's not all just I loved her, she was great, the legacy could be, man she used to just work my nerves, but I'm thinking about her all the time but she worked nerves; that's a legacy too.  I've kind of resolved that and that's the yoga of life, that's my Buddhist training tells me that's what it's really about.  You don't, you don't decide that you're a legacy, the world decides that you're a legacy 'cause you're too busy doing and picking yourself up off the floor when somebody says something to you that's evil, that's said to deter you from your vision and your mission.  You know when you're too busy stepping over the bombs and (laughter) you know the little snakes that are in the pathway as you're walking that are there to trip you up or like I tell the kids you know the mosquitoes are buzz in your ear to say you know you really need to go this way.  You see, that takes energy and you have to be so focused and you have to try to move from day to day and this is what life is about whether you're a dancer or an architect or doctor or singer doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter. And whe- even in your personal life, married, divorced, you know, rose- raised a child by myself you know, you keep, you keep going.
Story_ID: 446760
Speaker 1: In that vein, can you tell us a little bit about your family life?
Speaker 2: Yeah I mean I, you know I was married for twelve years, had a daughter [Yetunde Bronson], divorced.  My life has been like pretty much everybody else's life.  You know I've had scary health issues and had to overcome those and my daughter has health issues that we live with, we're overcoming those and life is up and life is down and life is in between, and you--I don't spend a lot of time contemplating why is this happening to me and why is my life so screwed up and why do only things happen to me?  That is such a waste of energy.  You know I spend my life thinking about what I can do when I get up in the morning.  You know I don't get up in the morning and go, okay what's going to hit me today?  You know why 'cause I assume I'm going to hit that day; that's the yoga of life is that, yeah, life sucks a lot.  Most of the time it can pretty much suck, and you can decide whether you're just going to stay in that milieu all the time or you're going to have joy in your life regardless of what happens.  Because I've travelled too much in the world and seen people who have nothing who have a lot of joy and peace in their lives.
Story_ID: 446761
Speaker 1: Is there anything I have not asked you that you think--
Speaker 2: Oh my god (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Okay.  No, you've covered a lot.
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Well, I think I can answer that this way it sounds so corny you know that I made a difference and you know everybody says that.  Well I think everybody should make a difference that should be a given so I'm--that's not my answer 'cause if you're living and you've got gray hair you should be making a difference in some shape or form, or no hair, gray hair and half gone (laughter).  But if you're over fifty years old you should have had some impact on somebody, okay, and if you haven't, and you can't recall who you've had, then you better get on it that's my attitude.  But I think I would most--my daughter [Yetunde Bronson] will tell you that most of the stories that she'll tell when I'm dead and gone are going to be funny, hilarious stories and I'm happy for that.  I would hope that when people--when I die and people talk about me that they have a lot of humorous stories, and they have a lot of stories that are about my intent, and my intent in life and that they can say that the one thing--with Ferne [HistoryMaker Ferne Yangyeitie Caulker], you either liked her or you didn't like her; there is not much in the middle.  You either like her or you don't like her and if you liked her there's a lot of joy there.  If you didn't like her, it's dark and that's all good because that shows that I was a human being who walked the planet who had a vision and spent her life trying to implement it the best way she knew how, and I don't think God would ask any more of me.
Story_ID: 449794
Speaker 1: That's me in the market in Tokyo [Japan].  The company was hanging out in 1990.  That was one of those riveting moments in our, in our history as a company.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: And that's--that's my--that was another turning point for me as a mom, and I think it's important in the arts to have a well-rounded life and having had a daughter puts things in perspective very quickly for you and that's my daughter's graduation from college, undergrad.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What's her name?
Speaker 1: Yetunde Bronson.  And that is a picture of my father when he was a young guy when he had first come to the United States to go to college, that's Solomon Brooks Caulker, and his smile is something that I'll never forget, that's, that's him.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  About what year was this do you think?
Speaker 1: That had to have been early '40s [1940s].  Yeah, that might have been at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], yeah it might have been at the University of Chicago.  A very old picture and I restored a lot of the pictures of my father and as much family as I can.  I actually wish I had brought this here. Oh, and that's my grandmother, that's my father's mother.  That's the matriarch in the Caulker family, and she's now deceased and gone, but her face is so wise.  (Unclear) I have only one--I have very few memories of her 'cause I was so small.  That's the Ko-Thi [Ko-Thi Dance Company] family, about--.  Those were my leaders that were in the company the Beverlys[AW1], McKinley Perkins, Roxanne Fair, myself.  This picture was taken about ten, about ten years ago as one of the covers for one of the programs we were doing.  Oh, that's a classic picture on a multiplicity of levels.  Number one in the tuxedo in the f- in the middle is Duma Safere [ph.], who worked with me for years building this company up, in terms of the orchestration and music.  I mean he made a major contribution to the company's growth and the company's musical legacy--if you want to call it legacy. And on the left side of the picture is Musa Musli [ph.] who is the man who is a self-made Af- drum maker of African drums and he's the one who I commissioned the nine 'Mwanemke Ngoma' women's drum set orchestra that Ko-Thi has.  So we have an all-women's drum orchestra and the drums are made by my design by Musa Musli.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Who's in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: He's in Chicago. And then to the right on the picture is (unclear) Chief Bey, Hawthorne [James Hawthorne], Bey, who is now an ancestor who really was a spiritual guide, and I mean incredible force and positive force with this company and development in this company artistically.  Yeah, and there we are again.  That's another one of those pictures that just radiates on so many levels.  It's, it's an amazing picture to see Bey there in the middle of us because his spirit was just so--yeah in the white hat his spirit was so open and yet so wise that I feel blessed to have had him come into my life.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  From left to right is--?
Speaker 1: So on the left side of the picture is Duma Safere and then myself, Chief Bey and Musa Musli from Chicago, the drum maker.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: And that's a picture of me twenty- twenty-five years ago (laughter) in a, in a costume that was designed for a piece that I did.  It's a modern African piece called 'Bifma' [ph.] and we worked with percussion and we had special head pieces made to look like some of the Maasai--a crossover of Maasai many years ago.  And that's another picture you can see some of the women's drum in the background and some of our dancers in the women's piece that we do.  That piece was actually a combination of a piece that Roxanne[AW2] (Unclear) orchestrated and the women's drum unit.  That's a piece that I choreographed called 'Gathering of Women'[AW3] ['A Gathering of Women,' Ferne Yangyeitie Caulker] which deals with the death of a small child who gets shot on the way going to the grocery store and we, we--I called it 'Gathering of Women' because I know how important women are in terms of in those kind of situations in the community.  And that's myself doing Ko-Thi's signature piece called 'Juba' [Ferne Yangyeitie Caulker] where--which is a crossover of Caribbean dance and African and Master Juba, who was William Henry Lane tap dancer done as an ancestral mask figure in a (unclear).  Wow, and that's me in 1980-something years ago doing a Caribbean solo in honor of [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham.  And again that's me in the middle doing a solo in one of our concerts.  That picture is about twenty years old.  It had to have been you know '80s [1980s], 1980, 'cause I can tell by the outfit that I have on.  This is a piece done, that's 'Harvest,' and features men in the company.  It's one of my goals is to really develop a strong men's unit.  It's been difficult in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] because we don't get a lot of fellows who want to--where in New York [New York], on the East Coast you have a lot more men who want to do dancing because it's not considered sissy.  This is another view of the company doing a piece called 'Isikathulu' ['Isikathulu Bootdance'], South African boot dance that we did, and again--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--and that gives you an idea of the kind of set and design and kind of work that we do on stage when we're mounted.  This is another close-up shot of the same dance in black and white.  Again a lot of precision work that we do in terms of our in costume design too.  That's me posing in front of the drum that I designed, the (unclear), which is actually put on a stand.  It's actually put onto a--it's a small version of a djembe--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a small version of a djembe that's put into a harness--a three-legged, legged stand--harness that has three legs on it--and there are nine drums so everything about the design of these drums that Musa made and they are made so that women stand and play them.  So we don't play them between the legs the way men do and we use stick in hand technique and the reason this is important is that everything is done in threes.  The legs--the stand is three and there are nine drums and they're in sets of three.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Well that's just me (laughter) and it had to be about twenty, thirty years ago and I think I'm staring up and asking what have I done?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Ko-Thi Dance Company in the '80s [1980s].  Wow, that's the whole group in a group pose for one of the shows that we did with a jazz band that we worked with--collaborated with in the company, and it's amazing to look at that 'cause a lot of those people aren't with--dancing with us anymore.  So it's really interesting looking at that group to see--after you've been around you know twenty, thirty, for- going into forty years, you're not going to have the same ensemble, and you, and we're in a cycle where we're rebuilding ensemble again.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah the generation--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the generation--yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: And that's me and my heart, my papa, my aesthetic papa, Chief Bey, yeah, I love that man.  He was just very, very special.  And there's my heart, and that is my mama, who died from lung cancer and was one of my greatest supporters especially during the beginning years, she was right there for me always when I had doubts, and she's still very much present.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What's her full name?
Speaker 1: Olive Leah Selby [Olive Selby Caulker].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's the latest brochure that we've sent out: A Passport--'Your Passport to African Music and Culture.' Drumtalk is our educational outreach program and we reach an average of on a good year thirty thousand students a year in schools and that's the program--the brochure that was sent out to all of the schools in this area.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's our general brochure that we give out that just explains all of our programs that we offer and it's a good tool, it's a marketing tool.  Wow, that is me in the early '70s [1970s] yeah that's in the early '70s [1970s] and I was doing a, for lack of a better term, a spiritual--it was a spiritual healing dance that was done as a solo.  That was a long time ago.  That's another marketing piece and again it's the Ko-Thi (unclear), it's the spirit, the ancestral spirit of William Henry Lane done in white tuxedos as a masked character (laughter).  And the dancers when they performed wore white, drop leg, shokatoe, tuxedo-type costume, and the drummers come out in tuxedos with white tennis shoes and drum.  So it's really a satire on--but it's also about combining again the Caribbean and the African influence into, and tap, so. And that was done over Lake, Lake Michigan.
