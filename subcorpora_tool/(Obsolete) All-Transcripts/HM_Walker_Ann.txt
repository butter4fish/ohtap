Speaker 2: I don't know the na- you know, the story behind the name.
Speaker 1: Okay, it just occurred to me, ah that's kind of odd name, you know.  But, okay.  Well can you tell us what you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing in--in history?
Speaker 2: My mother's mother was Betty Burke--Betty Elizabeth Burke [Betty Height].  She was a homemaker.  My mother's father [George Burke, Sr.] died when she was two years old and my grandmother married a Height.  So she was Betty Height.  And somehow we are related to [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height.  We used to always say we were with Cousin Dorothy.  I always called her Cousin Dorothy.  But I don't, we don't really know how Grandpa Height [Marcus Height] was related to her.  Probably on her, you know, her father, brother or something.
Speaker 1: And that's Height--H--Height?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So what did Mr. Height do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was retired from the railroad.  I--I guess a Pullman porter or something back in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was a railroad man?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You hear any stories from that side of the family about--I don't know--had--had they always been in New Jersey or were there any stories about the family coming from ne--from some other place to New Jersey?
Speaker 2: My grandfather came from Nor Lina--North Carolina, somewhere in that area.  And my grandmother came from someplace in Virginia, Emporia or someplace like that in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Emporia, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And my grandfather had four sons and a daughter.  My grandmother had four sons and a daughter.  My grandmother had a George [George Burke, Jr.], my grandfather had a George [George Height].  My grandmother had an Edward [Edward Burke] and my grandfather had an Edward [Edward Height].  And so my grandmother raised the ten children.  And I remember my mo- grandmother telling--my mother telling me about a time they all went to a party, all ten of them, and they was supposed to be home at eight o'clock and they were late coming home.  And she went down the line and gave everybody a whipping.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She didn't miss anybody, didn't--didn't discriminate.  Now did your mother talk about growing up in Freehold?
Speaker 2: Not too much.  My mother's--my grandmother's husband, sisters and brothers all took each of the children and tried to show them that they must have a home and whatnot, made them responsible.  So my grandmother's--my mother's Aunt Kate [ph.] wanted to take my grandmother with her because she had a daughter, Cousin Sadie [ph.], but my grandmother wouldn't--didn't wanna breakup the children.  So, I remember just them coming to visit, the aunts coming to visit and whatnot, and making sure that each one of them had a house.  That's all I remember about, you know, my mother talking about.  My Uncle John [ph.] lived in Washington, D.C. and he left my mother his house and he had a restaurant at 11th [Street] and U [Street].  And he left my mother his house and that's how we got to Washington, D.C. after she and my father separated.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay.  So, about what year is this that the family moves to D.C.?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-eight [1948].
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-eight [1948], okay.  So you were--you were a teenager I guess then?
Speaker 2: I was at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], I was a student at Virginia Union.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Well, now did--did your mother get a chance to go to school in?
Speaker 2: My mother went to Trenton Normal [New Jersey State Normal School at Trenton; The College of New Jersey, Ewing Township, New Jersey] for one year.
Speaker 1: That's like a teach- a teachers college?
Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: Tell me--give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Robert Willard Edwards [Willard Edwards].  R (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what is--
Speaker 2: R-O-B-E-R-T, and W-I-L-L-A-R-D, and they called him Willard by his middle name, like the call me Ann [HistoryMaker Ann Walker] by my middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born July 1st, 1906.
Speaker 1: And whe--where was he born?
Speaker 2: I believe in either Newark [New Jersey] or New York [New York], I think Newark.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what can you tell us about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: I didn't know his father that well until later years.  He went to Canada to make a living for the family.  He was a choir director and it seems like he did that in Canada.  And he had come back maybe about six to seven years before he died.
Speaker 1: What was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Paris, P-A-R-I-S, Paris Edwards.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was a choir director for--for a big church or?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I think it was a church.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what part of Canada?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it around St. Catherines [Canada] just north (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know, I just know he went to Canada.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay so, any stories about that side of the family being from somewhere other than New York and New Jersey?
Speaker 2: No, I just remember that his father was a member of the Methodist church in New York, because when my grandmother and I would go to visit him, we would always go to the Methodist church.
Speaker 1: This is the United Meth- I mean the big Methodist church not, not the--?
Speaker 2: It wasn't United then, but later it became A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 1: Okay, so thi- this is the A.M.E. church or the?
Speaker 2: It wasn't then, it was just Salem Methodist Church [ph.], but now it's Salem A.M.E., African American Episcopals, I guess that's what it is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, African Methodist Episcopal, yeah.  Okay, so it was a Methodist church that became a A.M.E. church, okay, that--that's odd.
Speaker 2: Yeah, American Methodist, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So any--any stories about your father growing up in Newark or?
Speaker 2: No, I know he liked to ride horses because we belonged to Belle Mead country club [Belle Mead, New Jersey] and we would ride every other weekend.  I had to visit with him by court order.  And we always did something special.  And he worked at the Howard Savings Institution or the Howard Savings Bank [Newark, New Jersey].  It was, I understand, the largest saving--the eleventh largest savings institution in the country, and he worked in their trust department.
Speaker 1: This is in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] or?
Speaker 2: This was in Newark.
Speaker 1: Newark, okay.  Howard Savings Bank, okay.  Wa- was this a black bank?
Speaker 2: No.  He got the job just before he and my mother [Mabel Burke Edwards] married.  When he got the job then they married and started--and bought the house.
Speaker 1: So--so did your--your father go to college?
Speaker 2: One year.  I believe he went one year at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] if I'm not mistaken, that's what I heard.
Speaker 1: Did he come from a fairly well to do family himself or?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say well to do, you know, just average.  But he made a good living, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you say he became a member of the Belle Mead country club?
Speaker 2: Yes, in Belle Mead, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay, was this an integrated country club?
Speaker 2: It was a black country club.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, see I got to know, you know, I have to ask these questions or nobody's gonna know unless I ask them.  But, okay, that's a black country club, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, we used to ride every other weekend.
Story_ID: 608787
Speaker 1: And I remember my mother [Mabel Burke Edwards] belonged to the Narcissus Bridge Club.  She--she loved to play bridge.  She tried to teach me, but I couldn't learn, I wasn't interested in cards.  And they would put on fashion shows, I guess for fundraisers and she would always win the prize, 'cause she would make her outfit and she would win first prize for best outfit.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Were there any other organizations she was a member of that you remember?
Speaker 1: I just re- she belonged to Bethany Baptist Church in Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now what--when you--oh what--tell me about your brothers and sisters, do you have any brothers or sisters?
Speaker 1: I don't have any brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: You're the only child?
Speaker 1: Only child, my father [Willard Edwards] said I was too expensive (laughter).
Story_ID: 608788
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities and their talents and their dispositions, who--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Both.  My father [Willard Edwards], he bought The Times every day because that was part of his job, he had to see who died.  And he did the crossword puzzle in The New York Times every day, and I do crossword puzzles all the time.  So I guess I took that after my (laughter) father.  And my mother [Mabel Burke Edwards] was very even tempered and I understand I'm very even tempered, and she was easy to get along with, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said your father's job was to check the obituaries for--this was for the bank [Howard Savings Bank, Newark, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: He was--he was with the trust department, which is--so I don't know, but he would say he would read The Times, the obituary column and he'd say, "Oh Old Man So and So died," (laughter), so he did that every day.
Speaker 1: Okay to make sure--
Speaker 2: For his job or something, yeah.
Story_ID: 608789
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I remember going to school in Vauxhall, New Jersey.  I remember leaving there perhaps in the fourth grade and my teacher was a Mrs. Rose [ph.].  And then I--we went--my mother [Mabel Burke Edwards] and I went to Freehold, that's when my father [Willard Edwards] and mother separated, and that's when we went to Freehold, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: So you were in--wh- what was the town first?
Speaker 2: We were in Vauxhall, New Jersey then.
Speaker 1: Vaux, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: V-A-U-X, capital [sic.] H-A-L-L.  That's near Millburn [New Jersey], Short Hills [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Wha- describe Vauxhall for us, and what kind of town was that?
Speaker 2: It was a prejudiced town I think, because I remember the blacks--the whites lived on this side of the school and most of the blacks lived on the other side.  We lived sort of in a mixed area.  There was--you didn't know, you know, about segregation or anything, there were whites and blacks on our street.  But when I look back, it was a segregated place.  Yeah, because there was a place across from where you--you'd turn right to our street, and you turned left to this other street, they called it the black bottom and that's where a lot of black people lived.  But I, I don't remember encountering any segregation or race--racism then, 'cause I was young (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So you, you went to an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Story_ID: 608790
Speaker 1: I want you to describe the house, I guess in Vauxhall [New Jersey] and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The house in Vauxhall was a nice house.  All the blacks on that street had nice houses.  I remember my father [Willard Edwards] was a scout master and I remember going on a camping trip with them at one time, and they called it going up the mountains.  Now I don't know what mountains there were, I know it was in Millburn [New Jersey].  But I had a nice childhood.  I thought we were a little special.  We summered in Belmar, New Jersey and I remember someone at the bank [Howard Savings Bank, Newark, New Jersey] with my dad owned the merry go round in Seaside Heights [New Jersey].  And we would go there in the summer and I would get on the merry go round in the morning and ride and ride and ride, eat my lunch and go back and ride around and around and around, because I could ride free (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Seaside Heights an amusement park I guess around (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seaside Pi- Seaside Heights had the amusement park.  Seaside Park [New Jersey] was right next to it, you could just walk, you know, down the boardwalk.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is this near Atlantic City [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: No this is near Toms River [New Jersey], Surf City [New Jersey], around that area.  And I, I think, I don't--I'm not sure, I think somebody from the bank must've gotten those houses for us in the summer, you know, and probably in their name and then we were able to go.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause you would've been segregated otherwise (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Probably, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 608791
Speaker 1: You said you never really had any problems with segregation or, or--?
Speaker 2: Not until I went to stay with my grandmother after my parents [Mabel Burke Edwards and Willard Edwards] separated.  And I didn't have a problem then.  I remember, this was in Freehold [New Jersey], I belonged to the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] and you could only use the YWCA on certain days.  It was one day a week for the colored, we were called then, for the colored girls.  And I remember somebody saying the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] was gonna come to the baseball park up the street from my grandmother, and I said, "Oh well I'll go."  And then they said, "Oh no you can't go, don't go," you know, they said, "You can't go to that.  You don't wanna participate in that."
Speaker 1: So you, you didn't know what it was (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I didn't know what it was, no, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: All right, so you were pretty in- innocent then in those days I guess in terms of (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In those days, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did, did your parents get the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] or the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], Afro-American [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers] any of those papers?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I remember getting Ebony I think.  I remember when it came out, first came out, Ebony and Jet.  I remember my father got those.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that wasn't until late '40s [1940s], yeah, nineteen forty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was when I was going back and forth every other weekend to stay with him.  I remember getting, you know, not when I was little.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would've been 1940 or '49 [1949] or something like that when Ebony and Jet started coming out.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well '46 [1946] I went to school, so it was before that, around then when it came out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So it was (unclear), okay, okay, all right.  So I know it was mid to late '40s [1940s].  Now did--so it was just you and your father and mother when you were little in the--in the household?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: None of the grandparents stayed with you or any aunts or uncles or anybody (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Story_ID: 608792
Speaker 1: You basically grew up I guess during the latter days of the, the Depression [Great Depression]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Because the Depression, I think it was in thirty something and I remember my father [Willard Edwards] had a good job.  I remember hearing that, that, you know, he had a good job.
Speaker 1: Right, right, 1929 it started and went on to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, and I was born in '28 [1928].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right, yeah.  So, so you basically grew up during the Depression, but you didn't--but you didn't really have--he had a--he did have a good job in those days.  Is there any story about how he got a job at the bank?
Speaker 2: I don't remember how he got it.  I just remember he got it before the got married and they bought the house soon, you know, they bought the house I guess before the wedding or I guess soon after they got married.  But he was able to buy the house so that they could go into the houses when they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so he never discussed how, you know, 'cause you, you would think would be some kind of a story of, you know, involved in getting a, you know, a job with a major white bank [Howard Savings Bank, Newark, New Jersey], you know, in those days?
Speaker 2: I don't--I don't remember any story, no.  But he was very personable and outgoing.  So, I don't know how he got to get that job.
Story_ID: 608793
Speaker 1: Was there a story about how your parents [Mabel Burke Edwards and Willard Edwards] met in the first place?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember.  I don't remember how he got from Newark [New Jersey] down to Freehold [New Jersey] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did they--do, do you have an sense of why they broke up?

Speaker 1: Okay.  But it happened when you were in college or?
Speaker 2: No, when I was--they separated when I was about nine, fourth grade, nine or ten, yeah.  And then I went to stay with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: So this was about 1938 then or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So that--that's when you went to Freehold?
Speaker 2: That's when I went to stay with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how, how was that--was that a traumatic kind of change for you?
Speaker 2: No, I enjoyed it.  My, my, my grandmother's sons all came by every day and one of them drove a truck and he delivered potatoes and he would bring potatoes.  I mean it was just fun for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I be- I joined the black church there, became a member and I remember being baptized there.

Speaker 1: Now were your lessons mostly in school or did you have?
Speaker 2: My piano lessons were private lessons from Miss Smoot [ph.].  And I remember, I won a camera as a prize at one of the recitals for doing, I guess, getting the most stars or something like that.

Speaker 2: I liked to draw, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So mostly pencil drawings or?
Speaker 2: Crayon, pencil, I was, you know, young then, crayons and pencils.  And I liked to read, 'cause I would always go to the library and I liked to read.  That was one of my hobbies.

Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know there's some in this--in the East, at least there are some, you know, there might have been an occasion to come across, you know?
Speaker 2: Not down there (laughter), not in Freehold [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Not down there, okay, all right.  Would--did--was there a difference in your education when you moved from Vauxhall to Free- Freehold?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a difference.  Because I remember in Vauxhall I was doing okay.  When I went to Freehold, then I started making all A's.
Speaker 1: Okay so, we can assume that Vauxhall had a higher standard?
Speaker 2: Maybe so, probably so, yeah.  And I didn't know how to play--the girls and boys played softball and volleyball, and I didn't know how to play those things.  But I learned how to play baseball, and when the boys needed a--someone didn't show up on their team and they needed somebody they would call me to play.  And I ran track.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's a lot of--so you ran track too, okay, all right.  What event did you run?
Speaker 2: It wasn't an event, you just ran back then.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't run the 100 yard dash or mile or?
Speaker 2: Oh no, I don't know what it was, but you just ran then.  And we would compete against other little towns, Matawan [New Jersey] and towns that were near us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So wha- what school did you attend in Freehold?
Speaker 2: Court--it was called the Court Street School [Court Street School Education Community Center, Freehold, New Jersey] and then Freehold High School [Freehold, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have any special teachers or mentors in school?
Speaker 2: I remember one teacher, Miss Frisbee [ph.], a black teacher.  She--I think she was excellent, she was an excellent teacher.  She lived in Asbury Park [New Jersey] and she would commute by train to school, and she was always seemed to be--always seemed like to me to be the first one at the school.  She was very strict and she wore long dresses just like the little old school teacher and a bun.  And every day on the wall, on the blackboard, there was a saying, if you--a stitch in time saves nine, something like that, every day there was a different one on the board.  And then you would have to explain what that meant so that you could understand it.  And I remember, I thought that was--I thought that was fun, and then you opened the school with Bible.  You had--you read the Bible every morning.
Story_ID: 608796
Speaker 1: We were talking about Miss Frisbee [ph.] at Freehold--she was at--at Pot Street School (simultnaoues)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Court, Court, Court.
Speaker 1: I misread my own writing (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Court Street, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Court Street School [Court Street School Education Community Center, Freehold, New Jersey].  Yeah, okay, yeah.  Now this is--I, I take it she was the only black teacher?
Speaker 2: No, there were several black teachers.
Speaker 1: Was it a black school?
Speaker 2: It was a black school, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is something we need to know, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a black school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause before you were in an integrated school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you go to Freehold [Freehold High School, Freehold, New Jersey], this is a black school.  And so they maintained in town a black school and a white school or was?
Speaker 2: Right.  But high school was integrated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--so Miss Frisbee was her name, spelled Frisbee?
Speaker 2: Ee.  Miss Frisbee.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so.  In--okay high school was integrated right?
Speaker 2: High school was integrated.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a chance to get involved in high school clubs and activities and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, like I said I played the piano for the orchestra my freshman and sophomore year, and I played the violin my junior and senior year.  That's when I came across prejudice.
Speaker 1: So how did it manifest itself?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a, a teacher her name was Pearl Button.  And the black kids said that Miss Button would never give a--the--a colored person an A.  So I said well I'm gonna make--to myself I said I'm gonna make an A under Pearl Button, and you know, I'm gonna try my best and see.  I worked so hard that s- I guess it was a semester, a quarter I guess they were on.  And the girl who was first violinist, Lydia (Unclear) who was from Russia, she was friendly with me.  And on all of the tests Lydia and I got the same grade that semester--that quarter.  When the report cards came out Lydia got an A and I got a B.  So I went to see Miss Button and why did I get a B.  She told me you got a very high B and Lydia got a very low A.  And so I figured that what the kids were saying was true.
Speaker 1: Yes, I've heard that before myself.  Interesting, but okay, so there was some prejudice there and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Some of the kids, I never, until I went back for a reunion, I never heard their voices.  Some of them were friendly and some didn't, you know, they didn't even speak to you.
Speaker 1: What percentage of the school was black would you say?
Speaker 2: Oh, maybe about 2 percent.
Speaker 1: Two percent, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there may have been about eight of us in the whole school, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I guess that's why they didn't bother to have a black high school I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I understand it's a regional high school now.
Story_ID: 608797
Speaker 1: Did you have it in your mind when you were in high school [Freehold High School, Freehold, New Jersey] that you were going to college somewhere at some point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew I was going to college.  I didn't know where.  But our pastor's daughter went to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia].  So that's where I decided to go.  And I also sent an application to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and Virginia Union was the first one to respond, so that's where I went.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there a lot of people in your church that were from Virginia or had ties to Virginia?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I imagine so--I imagine so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, before we leave high school, now, now you were in high school towards the--well the, the war started I guess, World War II [WWII] started while you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I remember going to the prom, I guess, I don't know whether it was my junior year or senior year, and we were the first blacks who had gone to the prom.  There were three couples who went to the prom.  And I remember one of the girls, her escort was a young man who was in [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your social life like in high school?  Did you--were you fond of music?
Speaker 2: Was I fond of music?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I mean popular music?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was fond of music.  I didn't have a lot of social life in high school because I had to go to my father [Willard Edwards] every other weekend and I had to get on the train and go to Newark [New Jersey], here from Freehold [New Jersey], or get the bus and go to.  And so wh- what most of the kids did on the weekend, that, you know, I wasn't really a part of it unless they were having a party on the weekend that I was there.  And then if you went to a party, your parents or your grandparents went to the party.  They entertained upstairs and the children were downstairs, young people were downstairs and then walked you to the party and they walked you home (laughter).  So, and we had--'cause I said we had the Y, YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], you went one day a week.  And then one of the ladies in the town formed a group, I don't even know what we were called, but it was a little social group where she taught us to cook, how to make things, to sew, and we used like a community hall or something and had a piano and ping pong table, I remember.  And then we would have meetings.  I don't even know what we met about, doing little things, you know.  But there wasn't much of a social life.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you had-- you're involved in--in some kind of organized life even way back then?
Speaker 2: The YWCA was organized, yeah.  Then the meetings that the lady held, and music.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now di- did you have a favorite radio program in those days?
Speaker 2: On Sunday afternoons we would go 'The Shadow,' something I don't know if you remember, "The Shadow knows."  And on--my uncle had five children and so all of the young people would go to my uncle's house, pull the shades down and sit in the dark and listen to, "The Shadow knows." It was spooky (laughter).  And then we would all go home and sometimes I would almost run home because I'd be so scared (laughter) and I lived way on the other side of town.  Sometimes my uncle would take me.  But that was one of the things that we all did.  On Sunday afternoon we met at my uncle's house, I think it came on at five o'clock.  And we sat there and watched, "The Shadow knows," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's another show called 'Lights Out' or something too that used to come on.
Speaker 2: To what?
Speaker 1: Did you hear of 'Lights Out' or?
Speaker 2: Yes, I've heard of 'Lights Out,' I think that came on later though.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay--
Speaker 2: And we went to Sunday school.  We went to Sunday school, we went to church, then you went back in the evening to BYPU, Baptist Young People's Training Union--Union [Baptist Young People's Union of America], and then you went back to church at night.
Story_ID: 608798
Speaker 1: Did you do very much travel growing up, did you get a chance to travel very much?
Speaker 2: Growing up, I--we would go see family--family and D- D- my uncle in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and I had a--some relatives in Glen Jean, West Virginia, I remember going to see them.  And in the summer we had, what they called, where my husband's father [John Wise Walker] taught me, all the high school children in New Jersey, the Baptists, went to a place called Bordentown, New Jersey.  And we had what they call the summer assembly where you--it was the Afro American summer assembly where you, you were taught about the Bible.  And his father was a teacher there.  His sister went there and his sister and I were good friends.  And I remember his brother coming up on Sundays to visit one of the girls that we kind of went around with.  And I thought his brother was so handsome.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you involved at all in National Baptist Convention meetings, did they have any of those con- conventions meetings?
Speaker 2: No, just, just the youth, you know, the youth department.  And I remember--I remember going to church in Asbury Park [New Jersey] and speaking.  It was just the young peoples had that sort of camaraderie.  And then the, the young people who went to Bordentown in the summer kind of kept touch, kept in touch with those in the winter.  And Bordentown normally was a manual, Bordentown MTI--manual training--manual training industrial school [Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth, Bordentown, New Jersey] and another whole set of children went there in the winter, you went all, all year round.  Well the, the fall, the spring and the summer.
Speaker 1: Okay. But we just went there in the summer.
Story_ID: 608799
Speaker 1: Do you recall any, any civil rights activity at all in, in--when you were growing up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The only thing I re--
Speaker 1: --any organized, you know, activity or the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] being involved?
Speaker 2: There was a Mr. Fenderson [ph.], he was always trying to get people to join the NAACP, course I was a kid.  But I do remember in my high school [Freehold High School, Freehold, New Jersey], one of the girls was going to be in a play and they said her brother before her had been in this play and he had gotten into a--jumped into a barrel of cotton and came out, you know, with his eyes big and whatnot.  And the black kids complained.  And they said that his sister was going to have to do the same thing.  And we decided if she did it, we were gonna walk out.  Well, I sat with the orchestra down at the front, I was playing violin then.  And when she, she didn't jump in the barrel of flour, she jumped behind the barrel of flour and was making the big eyes and whatnot.  And I got up and I walked out, nobody else walked out with me.  But we had said we were gonna walk out.  I went to my locker and got my things and went home, because assembly was the last period of the day.  And the next day the principal asked me why did I leave, and I told her, I did not want to see somebody of my race making a fool of themself.  She didn't reprimand me, I didn't get any punishment or anything.
Speaker 1: Wha- what did the other students say as their reason for not (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They didn't say anything, no.  I had just walked and that was it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They never--they didn't give any, any excuse for not walking out?
Speaker 2: No excuse or nothing, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You, you didn't ask them why they--why they--
Speaker 2: No I didn't ask them, I was mad with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this--this is your senior year, correct?
Speaker 2: It was either my junior or senior year.
Story_ID: 608800
Speaker 1: Did the high school [Freehold High School, Freehold, New Jersey] help you in terms of selecting a college or encourage you to go to college or?
Speaker 2: They did not encourage you because they tried to give me, I forget what the course was, and I said I wanna take a scientific course. That was the course if you're going to college.  And they tried to discourage me from taking the scientific course, but I insisted I was gonna take the sci- I wanted to take the scientific course.  And that's what I took.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  How were your grades when you came out?
Speaker 2: They were pretty good, yeah.  In your junior year if you ha- I you have--I think if you're in the top 15 percent you participated in the daisy chain, which was this big long chain of daisies and you present it to the seniors, and I presented that so my grades were good enough to do that, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were in the top 15 percent of the class?
Speaker 2: Yeah, evidently, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's pretty good (laughter).
Speaker 2: But as I--as I said, you know, I felt the teachers were prejudiced.  They didn't--they didn't pay attention to you, you know.  It seemed if you ask a question, it was dismissed.
Speaker 1: Were there any black teachers in high school?
Speaker 2: No, no, none, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any, any black athletes on the teams or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no.  And I remember going to one game, I didn't know wha- you know, anything about football.  But I heard them talking about coming to the game, I went by myself to the game and I didn't know what was going on, so I just went back home.  But nobody--no red--nobody black participated in anything.
Speaker 1: Did you run for class office or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Probably wasn't much chance of getting elected?
Speaker 2: No, no, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers there that tried to reach out to you or serve as a mentor or?
Speaker 2: Can't think of any.  Can't think of any.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, by the time you're a senior you know you're going to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they--I think it came out in the paper where the different class--members of the class were going.  And mine had it--had it wrong, it had Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], I was going to Virginia Union, but it--I don't know why it had Virginia State, that's in Ettrick [Virginia], and I was going to Virginia Union in Richmond.
Story_ID: 608801
Speaker 1: Tell us about Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], wha- how did you like it?
Speaker 2: I liked Virginia Union, I had a lot of friends.  Probably I had too many friends I guess.  I--my freshman year somebody asked me to run for Omega, was it--Queen of the Lamps.  The (unclear) to the Omegas.
Speaker 1: The Omega Psi Phi Fraternity?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my dear friend who I had--he, he was a good friend, he was dating my girlfriend up in Providence, Rhode Island.  In the summers we would go up there with my grandmother and you know, they wanted a young girl for her grandchild and so I met this girl, Almira [ph.].  And we would, I would go up there every summer and she would come to visit me every summer.  And she was dating this fella who had just come from [the U.S. military] service and he was going back to Virginia Union.  He had evidently been going wi- before he went to service.  And I forget what I was gonna say now.
Speaker 1: Oh I was asking about you--the Omega--the Omega (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh I had a good, yeah I was running for Omega--and Henry Wise told me, he said, "Ann [HistoryMaker Ann Walker]," he said, "don't run."  He said, "You're just a freshman," and there was somebody who had pledged AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], it was an Ivy Leaf who was running and they said, "We're all gonna vote for--," I forget the girls name, but he said, "We're all gonna vote for her" because he was an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  He said, "We're all gonna vote for her."  He said, "I can't even vote for you."  He said, "Don't run, wait unt- another year."  And I ran, but I lost by about, I think, eleven votes or three votes, something like that.  But I, I was a freshman, you know, and I enjoyed my freshman year.  I was--one year I was Dai- what is it Daisy Mae--they had the contest for Li'l Abner and Daisy Mae.
Speaker 1: Oh they call that the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sadie Hawkins Day.
Speaker 1: Sadie Hawkins Day, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd forgot about that--
Speaker 1: That's when the women chased the fellows down?
Speaker 2: You asked the fellows to go to the dance, yeah.  And I was Sadie Hawkins, I won that.  But I had a good time at Virginia Union, and then I met my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] there.
Speaker 1: Now he said there were so many suitors that he had to wait in line to, to get a chance to talk to you?
Speaker 2: No, I, I just got along with everybody.
Speaker 1: He was just here saying that now (laughter).
Speaker 2: Even the fellows who were difficult he would, you know, sometimes they had--didn't have such clean mouths and you walk to class across the campus and they would say something.  I could even get along with them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got along with everybody.
Story_ID: 608802
Speaker 1: Well, tell us how you met your husband, Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker]?
Speaker 2: Well, the first--the first affair at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] for the freshman was the green tea social.  And I was sitting on a piano st- bench and he came and sat down beside me and we started talking, and found out that his sister who was at Bordentown [Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth, Bordentown, New Jersey] with me and his father [John Wise Walker] taught me there.  So we sort of, you know, talked and whatnot and that was the end of it.  And then he was dating somebody who lived in our dorm on the next--the floor above me.  And she would always--she would be crying and complaining that he--when we went to the rec room he wouldn't dance with her, he would dance with everybody else and I was saying oh I don't think I, you know, I don't like him, you know, he treats her like that.  And then he said he--when, when we started going together--and later he tell me he wasn't, you know, her boyfriend or anything, he was not really her boyfriend.  But anyhow, he, he had pledged Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] and he was--he asked me to go to some kind of something that they were having in the afternoon and I went with him.  My girlfriend said don't go with him, don't go with him (laughter), but I went.  And then that evening we went to Morris Street church and it was a Christmas service and while we were in the Christmas service he kind of reached over and took my hand and held my hand.  And then after that, we just--that was our sophomore--that was my sophomore year and we just started keeping company.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you all got married in what 19--
Speaker 2: Fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: Fifty [1950], '50 [1950], right, right.  Were you still in school at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] then--
Speaker 1: You were at Howard.
Speaker 2: --and he would--when he would go home he would stop off in Washington [D.C] and when he went back to school he would stop off in Washington and I would see him.  Then sometimes I would go there for the May Day dances or something like that or the Alpha ball, and (unclear) ball or something like that.
Speaker 1: So he was in Virginia--
Speaker 2: He was still at Virginia, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was getting his master's in theology?
Speaker 2: No he was--he was still in undergraduate school.  'Cause by the time--he, he graduated in '50 [1950] and we--he graduated in '50 [1950] must've been in--in June and we got married in December of '50 [1950] when he just--he had just started back to seminary, he just started in the seminary.  Yeah, so then we got married.  And I'd worked in Washington for the gentleman who became the mayor, Mayor Walter Washington, I worked in his office.  He was not the mayor then, he was with the housing department [National Capital Housing Authority].  Walter Washington, yeah.
Speaker 1: I know, I remember, yeah, he was appointed the mayor of Washington D.- he was the first black mayor of Washington, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) First black mayor of Washington.  Very gent- such a gentleman and his firm was Coleman, Parks and Washington [ph.].  They were a nice group of men, lawyers and I enjoyed working for them I really did.  But then I got pregnant right away.

Speaker 1: A lot of Joyces (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And his sister Joyce and I were sort of friendly.  But I'm trying to think who else was in that class.  I don't remember Toni Morrison.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a note that she was there, you might not have known her.  She was--she was there at that time.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you who was--who was there Roxie Roker.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  She, she was a actress in 'The River Niger' [Joseph A. Walker] on Broadway, and she was in a TV show, what's the one with a- 'The Jeffersons,' 'The Jeffersons' (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'The Jeffersons' that's right.  She was the wife, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay yeah.  What was--what was she like in school, what was David Dinkins like?
Speaker 2: I didn't know, you know, David as a friend, he was a friend of a friend of mine, a fella that I was sort of halfway dating, Jesse Pone [ph.].  And he--they were both from Trenton, New Jersey.  But I just remember he always dated, whatever, you know, he dated Joyce.  They were a cute, a very attractive couple.  And then, Roxie and I just had phys ed [physical education] together and we sh- had the same locker card, yeah.  But she was very nice, very personable.  She was in something then called 'The Blacks' or something like that, some play put on by Howard.
Speaker 1: Oh 'The Blacks:  A Clown Show' [Jean Genet].
Speaker 2: By Howard's players, she was with Howard Players [Howard University Players], yeah.  She was very pleasant.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'The Blacks:  A Clown Show' that's the name of the play, yeah.  Okay.  So, say were there any teachers at Howard that--that really stand out or any other experiences at Howard in those days?
Speaker 2: I remember a Mr. Ossining [ph.], I don't know his first name, but he's--he was--we were boaters, my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] and I were boaters and the fella who had a boat, he was a radio personality from New Jersey, Gu- Gus Heningburg, do you know that name?  Gus Heningburg?  Well, he--in talking, you know, 'cause he had a boat at the same marina that we had--ours was at, and Gus said Mr. Ossining was his godfather, yeah.  'Cause we were talking one day and I was talking about this Mr. Ossining who always wore a three piece suit and a vest, and he had an accent.  I think he was from Louisiana.  He evidently had sort of a Creole accent.  And he said that's my godfather.  But I remembered Mr. Ossining who taught accounting.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you encounter Howard Thurman at all, I think he was there in those days at the school of theology [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: No I remember Howard Thurman from after we were married.  He was in Boston [Massachusetts], I believe.  Wasn't he from Boston?  I remember my husband make reference to--references to Howard Thurman.
Speaker 1: At Boston U- U- University [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Was he at Boston U?
Speaker 1: Well he was at Howard, you know, he taught theology at Howard and then he went to San Francisco [California].  I'm not sure if he was in Boston, I'm not sure.  I know he was at Oberlin in Ohio before he went to Howard.
Speaker 2: No, but Mordecai Johnson was president when I was there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well Thurman is a theologian, you know, yeah.  Do you have any stories about Mordecai Johnson?
Speaker 2: No, no I just remember he was president of Howard.  And my--our next door neighbor was in the phys ed department and she became head of the department after Dr. Farabee [ph.].  And then across the street was the treasurer, Mr. Morgan [ph.].  His daughter and I became--one of his daughters and I became best friends, and she's my s- my middle son [Robert Walker]--my oldest son's [Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr.] godmother, Christine [ph.].  And then next to them was Dean Price [J. St. Clair Price] and Mrs. Price they both, Dean--Dean Price was the dean of the liberal arts school, and his wife was in--head of the nursery department.  I remember my mother [Mabel Burke Edwards] was sick in Washington [D.C.] and Mrs. Morgan told me to let our daughter Patty [Patrice Walker Powell] go to the nursery with Dean Price the next day, and so Dean P- Mrs. Price took her to the nursery school up on Howard.  And when we got back to Richmond [Virginia], my daughter had to go to the bathroom and a good friend of ours on the campus who was head of the science department, Dr. Bradley [ph.] said, "Oh I'll take you Patty."  And he said, "What you have to do, tete?" She said, "No I have to defecate."  She had learned (laughter) that in the nursery school at Howard.  And he said, "Well your mother better take you," (laughter).  And their niece lived with them and I remember her going to school every day with little white gloves.
Story_ID: 608804
Speaker 1: After you graduated from, from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] did you seek employment or?
Speaker 2: That's when I next I got employment right away at with Coleman, Parks and Washington [ph.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, with Coleman, Parks and Washington.
Speaker 2: I saw an ad in the paper and I answered it and I got it right away.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it didn't take any time.
Speaker 2: And they wanted me to go back to law school, wanted me to go to law school, but I was getting married [to HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker], so that was the end of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause you, you had your first child [Patrice Walker Powell] in '52 [1952]?
Speaker 2: Right, January '52 [1952] I--after we were married four months and I got pregnant.
Speaker 1: All right and the second one [Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr.] in '53 [1953].  Okay and third [Robert Walker] in '55 [1955].  And the fourth [Earl Walker] in '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: Right, I had four in five years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're pretty busy?
Speaker 2: I was pretty busy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As a mother, yeah.
Story_ID: 608805
Speaker 1: Now when you're having your children you were living in--you were living in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] at first right?
Speaker 2: No, I was living in--
Speaker 1: Petersburg [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Petersburg, because my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] was still a student [at Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia].  So I came down and lived on--we lived in the girls dormitory.  One end was for married people, but we lived in the girls dormitory.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's interesting.  I've heard that before when people live--live on the dormitories of campuses.  Okay, so it's getting crowded though, ho- how long did you live there?
Speaker 2: Oh we only lived there--see he finished in '53 [1953] and we--in '53 [1953] he had the church, so we went to Petersburg.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you just had the one baby in there, okay?
Speaker 2: Well I had the one in New Jersey, 'cause I went to New Jersey with his mother [Maude Pinn Walker] to have her, that's the oldest one [Patrice Walker Powell].  And then I came back to the campus and I was pregnant with the second one [Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr.] who was born in Richmond [Virginia].  And then the third [Robert Walker] and the fourth [Earl Walker] were born in Petersburg.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, well what was your impressions of Petersburg?
Speaker 2: Well, I was kind of busy because I had the four children, but Petersburg was very prejudiced and as my husband said, there was nothing integrated in Petersburg, nothing.  So, I stayed home, you know, with the children 'cause I had to.  But then the coloreds got restless in Petersburg and then it started to be--started activity, you know, toward integrating.  So by when they had the sit-in at the library, my children, two children and myself, we went, but I was not arrested.  But my husband was well known then as being a troublemaker, and when my daughter was ready to go to school, my daughter was barred from all public schools.  Governor, I guess it was Lindsay Almond [James Lindsay Almond, Jr.], I have the clipping in the paper.  You had to fill out a pupil placement form if you lived in the State of Virginia that you would not send your child to an integrated schoo- to a white school.  And my husband and I and some others refu- said we would not sign it.  I don't know what happened to the others, but we were the only ones who did not sign it, and our child was refused admittance to any school in Petersburg.  And so we sued the State of Virginia, but they said that you are--we sued them because they were making us break the compulsory school law, we thought.  They said you are permitted or allowed to go to school until age seven, and she wasn't seven.  You're compelled to go after age seven, so we lost the case.
Speaker 1: Okay ca- because she wasn't seven years old then?
Speaker 2: She wasn't seven, uh-huh.  And then they finally called and said that she could--if we presented her at the school, she would be allowed to attend.  I took her to the school and they were gonna put her, I don't know whether it was kindergarten or first grade, whatever was the beginning year, but she was reading then because I homeschooled her before, you know, you knew homeschooling was.  And they were gonna put her in the first grade or the kindergarten, which ever it was, and so I said oh she's reading and they said well she's going into kind--I said well I'm not leaving her so I brought her on back home.  I wouldn't leave her.  So ultimately they asked the lady--the principal was a member of our church and they said Evelyn Berry, who was a Link [The Links, Incorporated] at that time, she evidently tested the children to see where they went and whatnot.  But they said if Evelyn Berry tested her, she would decide where she was to go.  And so Evelyn tested her and she put her in the proper grade, and so she was allowed to go to school.
Story_ID: 608806
Speaker 1: Was this your first exposure to The Links [The Links, Incorporated]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, really back then, yeah because my--the Walkers who lived up the yard from us, who were our dear friends, we were not kin or anything.  But they took the trees down between their yards so that my kids would have a big playground, you know, and like they kept cookies and cereal in their cabinets and their door open and my kids would just go up the yard and do what they wanted to do there, eat and whatnot.  Call me up and say, "Mom I'm not coming home tonight, I'm staying up here at my Maddie's [ph.]," (laughter).  So she was a Link, Jo was a Link, Jo Walker--Jo Jones Walker--Jo Walker Jones [ph.].  And so that was the first I knew of The Links when she was entertaining them.
Speaker 1: Now were they--were they--did you--when did you join The Links?
Speaker 2: I didn't join The Links until, let's see we just have--1990 or '89 [1989] or 1990.  Yeah I wasn't a member then.
Speaker 1: But you--is--that was your first introduction to Links was back then?
Speaker 2: I didn't know what they were.  These ladies all had to bring gifts and I thought, you know.  They had every--when you were a hostess you had to give everybody a gift and it was fancy then.
Story_ID: 608807
Speaker 1: Your husband was saying when we interviewed him that, that people were starting, as his activities in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], and with the Pe- Petersburg Improvement Association as they kept escalating, they kept, you know, hammering at the door for different things, his popularity started to become controversial.  Some people loved him more, some people hated him more.
Speaker 2: Well you know the teachers were employed by the--what the city and state, so that's their salary, you know, they didn't want you messing with that.  And then a lot of the members of our church were members of Virginia State, State College's faculty [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], and that's a state school.  So they didn't want you messing with that.  And then Dr. Daniel [Robert Prentiss Daniel], who was also a member of our church, was the president of Virginia State.  He barred my husband from coming to the campus because the students from the campus were getting active in the movement, and so he barred my husband from coming over there.
Speaker 1: This is something that--that we don't hear about a lot, I mean, but the resistance to civil rights on the part of the black community, the people who really--
Speaker 2: And you can understand, you know, that's their livelihood.  When we went to Atlanta [Georgia], the people thought we were strange, all of our neighbors, because my husband was going to jail and they said we talked funny (laughter).  And I guess they, they just thought we were troublemakers.  The teachers, they didn't want their jobs--they didn't want to lose their jobs and whatnot.  So it was le- we, we understood they could not get involved with so much.  But in Petersburg [Virginia], the teachers joined, but they joined the NAACP and you know, but they would contribute but you couldn't use their name.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they supported as much as they could with not being known.  Did--when, when it was time to--when your husband was offered the position as executive director of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] by Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in 1960, I guess it was, did you--he, he was saying that he was felt it was probably time to leave Pe- Petersburg by--at that point.  Did you feel that way, did you feel like you just as well?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, you know, old fashioned back then, you go with your husband.  So he said we were going to Atlanta, didn't make any difference to me, cause I knew I could make friends anywhere.  So we packed up and off to Atlanta we went.  I didn't know a soul in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: And you said that folks thought you talked funny?
Speaker 2: Yeah, our neighbors thought we talked funny.
Speaker 1: Now this is interesting 'cause, you know, I think those who have a causal interest in the Civil Rights Movement think of Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] as a southern minister, when he's really not so southern at all, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At all, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so you all are basically out--from the outside according to, to the South (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were outsiders.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened, you--did you have--now by this time you probably met Dr. King already?
Speaker 2: I'd met Dr. King, yeah.  Because he had been to our home, because they would have meetings at our home.  All three of them.  They would have meetings either at one of the churches or at our house, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 608808
Speaker 1: What were your impressions of some of, of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference when you got to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, the only p- you mean in--from Petersburg [Virginia] or when we got to Atlanta?
Speaker 1: Atlanta.
Speaker 2: I knew they were hard workers.  I knew my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] was a hard worker and a hard taskmaster, and I met his secretary, Willie Mackey [Willie Pearl Mackey].  She was--she told me after--she said, "Ms. Walker [HistoryMaker Ann Walker]," she said, "I used to hate your husband."  She said, "But I know now that he developed my skills and taught me perseverance and taught me to be on time."  Because he would say, "When you come in at nine o'clock don't come in with a cup of coffee and a donut.  At nine o'clock I want those typewriters to be ringing."  And she said, "I, I appreciate him now and I respect him now."  He was a hard taskmaster.  But the people in the SCLC they were all--I thought they were all, you know, nice when we moved there.  I--we lived way outside of Atlanta, we couldn't affo- we had five hundred dol- well we had a thousand dollars.  We put five hundred dollars down on our house and five hundred dollars down, gave Jim Woods 'cause he didn't have any money and he had four or five children, gave him five hundred dollars to put down on his house.
Speaker 1: That's James Woods, okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And we all--we lived near each other.
Speaker 1: Now the, the third person that came to visit you--
Speaker 2: Dorothy Cotton.
Speaker 1: Cotton--Cotton, Dorothy Cotton.
Speaker 2: Dorothy Cotton, yeah.  I don't know where Dorothy lived.  But we lived in this, you know, kind of poor area and it was a small house with three boys [Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr., Robert Walker and Earl Walker], we had bunk beds and a bed in their room, and then our bedroom, I guess we just had the two--oh and my daughter's [Patrice Walker Powell] room.  So we had three bedrooms, but they were small rooms.  And we had one of the fellows from SCLC, this was Dr. King's right hand, he traveled with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] everywhere, I'm trying to think of his name.
Speaker 1: Bernard Lee?
Speaker 2: Bernard Lee.  He, he didn't have a place to stay.  His family was in Selma [Alabama], not Selma but someplace else in the South.  And he couldn't get home to his family, so he, he slept on our living room couch.  And our living room couch was a sle- flat, I guess a door and my husband put legs on it and we bought a cushion, you know, a mattress and put on it.  And Bernard slept in our house for about a year, maybe longer than that.  And I thought, you know, they were all hard workers and serious.
Speaker 1: Okay, it sounds serious to me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were--they were serious.
Story_ID: 608809
Speaker 1: Now you got involved in the Freedom Rides, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah that was--that was the first thing I got involved in when we went to Atlanta [Georgia].  And like I said, I had the four children [Patrice Walker Powell, Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr., Robert Walker and Earl Walker] so I couldn't do much.  But I, I wanted the world to be a better--or the country to be a better place for my four children, and then I was supporting my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] because he was working with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And so he said he was going on the Freedom Rides, this was after the bus was burned in Annis- Anniston and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Anniston, Al- Alabama, right, yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: Alabama, yeah.  And he said he was going on the Freedom Ride and I, I didn't tell him right away.  I thought about it and I said well what can I do with the children, and then we sent the children to their grandparents and great-grandparents every summer anyhow, so--up in New Jersey.  So I said well this would be a good time to send them for a vacation and then I decided I was going on the Freedom Ride.  And I, I remember thinking that it would be just a small, like a drop in the bucket.  I remember that phrase, thinking that phrase to myself.  And I didn't have money to go--to give.  So I decided I would go on the Freedom Ride.
Speaker 1: Okay, now wh- what did your husband think of that idea?
Speaker 2: I just told him I was going too, and he accepted it.  'Cause I had made, you know, I had thought about what we're gonna do with the ch- four children and everything.  But I didn't tell my parents [Mabel Burke Edwards and Willard Edwards] or my grandparents.  My father said I'll meet you in Washington [D.C.].  He said he wouldn't come visit us, but he did come to Virginia.  He never came to Atlanta.  My grandmother came.
Speaker 1: Now tell us about the Freedom Ride.  Now where, where did you, what, what was this particular ride about and where did you start and where--how did it end up?
Speaker 2: We started in Atlanta and then we went to--
Speaker 1: How many buses were involved in?
Speaker 2: This was just one bus.
Speaker 1: One bus, okay.
Speaker 2: And there were about eight of us.
Speaker 1: On the bus?
Speaker 2: On that bus.  I mean with other people.
Speaker 1: Is this a Greyhound or?
Speaker 2: Public--Greyhound bus.  Oh I don't know if it was Greyhound [The Greyhound Corporation; Greyhound Lines, Inc.] or Trailways [Trailways National Bus System; Trailways Transportation System, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Or Trailways or?
Speaker 2: Trailways, one of them yeah.  But there were other people on the bus, and just us.  There were two white girls, two white women.  One's daughter was Margaret--Margaret Young, I think her name was Margaret Young [sic.].  She was a writer for the Atlanta Constitution [Atlanta Journal-Constitution].  Her mother was a writer for the Atlanta Constitution.  And she called me the night before we're to leave and she said, "Miss Walker [HistoryMaker Ann Walker], I understand you're going on the Freedom Ride. My daughter is going too."  She said, "I want you--will you look out for her?"  And I told her, I said, "Yes, I'll look out for her."  And the next day when we go--gathered that morning to get on the bus, she said, she came up to me she said, "Miss Walker, I asked you to look out for Sissy," she said, "but when I saw you I asked Sissy to look out for you," (laughter).  Sissy Leonard, she was Margaret Leonard, she was a write for the Atlanta Constitution, yeah.  So we got on the bus in Atlanta and went to--
Speaker 1: So this--this is a white lady, right?
Speaker 2: White lady.
Speaker 1: Writing for the Atlanta--Atlanta Constitution, right.
Speaker 2: And another white girl, Mimi Feingold [Miriam Feingold Real] was from California.  I don't know how she got to get to Atlanta, but the two white girls.  I was the only black woman, and there were, I guess, two or three black men.  Oh, one, one black--one white man was a lawyer from Westchester County [New York], Harry Schwarzschild [Henry Schwarzschild] and he had been working with Dr. King.  He had slept in my children's bunk beds and whatnot, a good fella, good fella.  So we all got--I guess there was seven or eight of us and we got on the bus and went to, I don't know whether Birmingham [Alabama] was the first stop or Montgomery [Alabama] was the first stop.  But the driver wouldn't let us off to go to the bathroom or anything.  And I remember on the bus there was a, a black boxer and his mother had fixed him a lunch, I don't know where he was going, but his mother had fixed him a lunch and he shared some of the food with us.  Some of the food that his mother had fixed for him.  But the driver--we were not allowed to get off the bus.
Speaker 1: So the bus company was trying to a--avoid conflict.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well.
Story_ID: 608810
Speaker 1: Were there any whites at the--angry white people at the bus stop (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When got--when we got to Jackson, Mississippi there were policemen on both sides and if you wanted to go someplace else you couldn't.  But they escorted you right into the white waiting room and arrested you.  As soon as you stepped in that door, you were under arrest.  And so we spent the first night in the Jackson, Mississippi city jail.  The two white girls [Margaret Leonard and Miriam Feingold Real] were in the cell next to me.  They gave us cold peas and cold corn for dinner.  And the mice were running up and down the bars of the jail--of the cells.  And I could talk to the two white girls in the next cell, see we--they were segregated.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they were white they had their own cell.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right they were in--yeah.  And then the next morning, I kept notes and I still have them of every day we were in jail.  I think like five or six o'clock the next morning they got us up and took us to the county jail, the Hinds County jail [Hinds County Detention Center, Jackson, Mississippi].  And that's where I did a week and it was terrible.  I couldn't talk about until maybe about twenty--twenty, twenty-two years ago, it was so bad.
Speaker 1: Well what was it like?
Speaker 2: There were bugs.  There, I think, thirteen of us in one cell.  You're sleeping on the floor and whatnot, and at night when the girls were sleeping you could see the bugs crawling over them.
Speaker 1: Now these are--these are all black women?
Speaker 2: All black women in that one cell, the white women were in another cell.  And the food, they would--as I remember I think they put it through a slit and something in the bottom of the door and they gave you your food that way.  The food was terrible and you had no, we had no, no toothbrushes, no washcloths or anything.  And they kept telling us we would get them until finally one of the white--one of the black ministers came and brought things.  He said he'd left a package, I think he said something like thirty pounds, I have it in my notes, but we never did get them.  And we couldn't, the water--it seemed like when you wanted to take a--to take a glass of water, it was hot.  And if you wanted to bathe, it was cold.  I mean it was just--it was just terrible.  And the guard was so mean.  At night he would turn the air conditioner on.  If it was cool, he would turn the air conditioner on.  In the day, he would turn the heat on.  And we would sing to the men--I could hear my--we could hear the men singing and I don't know where their jail was, it was somewhere near, but we could hear them singing and we would sing back to them.  And he would tell us to stop singing and we wouldn't stop singing.  And that's when he would turn the air conditioning on so that we would stop singing.  But it didn't stop us.  And those girls were the--they were as clean as any college roommate.  And they si- had a line strung up, I don't know if it was a string or what across the cell and they would rinse out the little things, you know, at night and hang them on the line.  But it was terrible.  And the Salvation Army came by one day and they told us we were all going to hell.  We were sinners and all going to hell (laughter).  We're sitting in that, you know, riding the bus anyplace we wanted to sit.
Speaker 1: This is a white, white members of Salvation Army?
Speaker 2: White Salvation Army, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what kind of songs did you sing, do you remember what?
Speaker 2: We sang the freedom songs, "Over my head, I hear music in the air" [sic. 'Freedom in the Air'], 'We Shall Overcome,' there was something to the tune of 'Day O' ['Banana Boat Song'], 'Day O' that [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte sang.  We, we--I had--I forget the words to that, but we sang it.  Whatever, you know, anybody knew that was a freedom song.  We--they were called freedom songs and we would sing them, uh-huh.  And then somebody had a book, may have been more than one but I read, I forget the name of it, 'The Long Day' [ph.] or something like that.  Somebody had a little radio and we could hear when they would take some of the cellmates out to go to Parchman penitentiary [Parchman Farm; Mississippi State Penitentiary, Parchman, Mississippi].  Then the next, you would hear on the radio, you know, "Some Freedom Riders left So and So and they'll be in Jackson [Mississippi] at such and such a time."  So we knew somebody else was coming.  And they were--they were a nice group, there was never any confusion, no friction.
Story_ID: 608811
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other member of the group?
Speaker 2: I have the names, I can't--I remember Mary Hamilton, I remember her and I don't know if she was in our group--in our cell at that time, because they thought she was white.  She was black, but they thought she was white and they put her in a white cell and then they found out that she really was black and then they put her in--in the black cell.  But Ruby Doris Smith [Ruby Doris Smith Robinson], as I remember.  I have a list of all the names and I have a drawing of where each person slept and a drawing where the toilet was.  There was one toil- toilet right at the gate, the bars.  So when you went to the bathroom, you know, trustees or whoever was walking by would--saw you.  I mean it was terrible, it was terrible.
Speaker 1: Was Diane Nash in?
Speaker 2: She wasn't in then, no, no.  I think she went--I don't know whether she went before we went in or after.  But I know she--I think she was a rider.  Percy Sutton, do you know that name from New York [New York]?  He was in with my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] I believe.  Because my husband and I wrote notes back and forth and we'd send them by the trustee.  And I don't know how Percy got them, but he had them published in either, I forget whether it was the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] or the Afro-American [Afro-American Newspapers] in New York, yeah.  But it was a horrible experience.  It was a terrible experience.
Speaker 1: And how long did, did it last?
Speaker 2: We stayed in a week.  We stayed in a week.  And then my husband says, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] did not come to get us because I--they were gonna send me to Pen- to Parchman penitentiary [Parchman Farm; Mississippi State Penitentiary, Parchman, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: And that's a horrible place (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I understood--stood that was terrible.  And they said that they did--some of the--we got word that they did vaginal exams with no gloves or anything.  And so I said well I've got children I don't want--I don't know whether they're gonna try to give you something or what, but I said I don't wanna go to Parchman.  So, we got word to Dr. King and I don't know whether he came or he sent somebody that we wanted to come out, that was after seven days.  And somebody came and got us out of jail.
Speaker 1: You're bailed out, basically?
Speaker 2: Bailed us out.  And then, when we left the jail, we were getting our things, you had to put all of your things in an envelope when you went in.  When they gave me the envelope when I came out, my wedding ring was missing.  And so my husband, you know, said, "My wife's ring is not here."  And the, the sher- the jailer said, "Well I'm the only one who has the key so, you know, nothing--I didn't take anything, nothing is missing."  And my husband said to him, "Well if you're the only one who has the key, then you stole my wife's ring."  And I said, "Oh my goodness we're going back in jail again," (laughter).  But I never did get it.  They claim that a trustee took it and put it in the metal door.  I don't know why a trustee would put the ring in a metal door and then it dropped down and there was no way they could get it.  Now I don't know how they found that out.  And the trustees who we remember--who I remember, they brought us ice cream one night.  They were black, but they brought us ice cream one night.  So I mean, they were on our side, more or less.
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting.  Here you are in a white--in a jail--in jail by the white authorities, but the people who take care of you are black?
Speaker 2: Well now, I don't know whether the trustees, if they were in jail and you know, were--had done most of their time and were doing good or something, and they were, you know, given that special privilege or not, I don't know.  But I know they said they were the trustees.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's all--that's--yeah that's happened before.  We--we've interviewed other people, in fact we interviewed a man [HistoryMaker James Cameron] who was lynched and cut down, and then--he was a teenager and he was a trustee in a jail in Indiana.  He would go get the food for the rest of prisoners and everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because they would bring our food in the morning and after--at lunchtime and in the evening.  And I think that maybe they got, you know, special food or could get more of it or something like that.  They gave us so many white beans, those white navy beans and I loved them (laughter).  And the rest of the girls, most of them were college age.  See I was married with four children [Patrice Walker Powell, Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr., Robert Walker and Earl Walker]. And they wouldn't eat it, but I ate it.  And so when I left the jail, I had gained weight.  Everybody else had lost weight.  But I had gained weight.  And someone told me to, to drink Ensure and--to lose the weight, but I didn't know you weren't supposed to eat and drink the Ensure, so I was eating and drinking the Ensure and still gaining weight.  And then someone told me, said now you either drink the Ensure or--and, and don't eat or you eat and don't drink the Ensure (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were there any repercussions from that jail sentence?  I mean, did you have to appear in court or judge I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had to go back.  And Constance Bakley--Constance Baker Motley was our attorney.  And I was in awe of her.  She was--I thought she was so beautiful and stately and she was so well spoken and everything.  And I think we were fined a hundred dollars or something like that, and I don't know who paid it.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is 1961, right?
Speaker 2: This was 1961, June of 1961.
Story_ID: 608812
Speaker 1: Now were you privy to the--the Project C?
Speaker 2: Well, not that much.  It was Mother's Day, I don't know whether this was '62 [1962] or '63 [1963], and my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] was to come home from Birmingham [Alabama] for Mother's Day, and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Reverend Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy] had churches, so they had to go to their churches for Mother's Day.  So they asked my husband to stay in Birmingham--well leave somebody in Birmingham.  So my husband called and asked me to come down and bring the children.  So I left my car at the airport in Atlanta [Georgia], East Point [Georgia] which is where the airport is just outside of Atlanta, and the chi- the four of us--the four children and myself got on a plane and went to Birmingham.  That day, somebody had bombed A.D.'s home--
Speaker 1: A.D. King [Alfred Daniel Williams King].
Speaker 2: --A.D., Dr. King's brother.  And so the blacks were throwing stones and they had gotten restless.  They were upset because somebody had bombed A.D.'s home.  And so my husband left, we were staying at the Gaston Motel [A.G. Gaston Motel, Birmingham, Alabama], and my husband left the motel to go to try to get them quiet because, you know, Dr. King was--non--practiced nonviolence.  So my husband went to try to quiet the crowd down and we were left at the Gaston Motel.  And whi- and while we were there, the National Guard came in and they said everybody get into the lobby.  Well my two older children [Patrice Walker Powell and Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr.] had gone home with some friends of ours, the Barefield-Pendletons who had a boy and a girl the same age.  And my two younger children [Robert Walker and Earl Walker] were in the ho- in the motel asleep in the room.  And I said I have to get my children.  And one of the National Guard man took his gun butt and struck me in the head and I had, well they were trying to take me to the hospital but I said I can't go because I have two children in the room.  And so Mary Hamilton, one of the Freedom Riders, got my two children, the two babies, the boy--the two boys and she brought them and put them in the ambulance with me and we went to the hospital.  And she stayed with me.  I got out the next morning.  I said I wanna go home, I just wanna go home.  I left Atlanta  [sic. Birmingham] with the four children, flew back to East Point or outside of Atlanta to the airport, it was at night.  The policeman recognized my husband's car.  I was two--I was two blocks into the city of East Point when a police car pulled up beside me and said, "What do you do when you see the light flashing on a police car?"  I said, "You pull over."  They said, "Well you didn't pull over, so you follow me to the jail."  So I followed him with the four children.  They arrested all four of us--this must've been in 1963.  So my--Patty was born--in '62 [1962], she was nine.  She was the oldest one.  And I tried to call Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], and I called the church, but--that was on a Sunday evidently and I couldn't get him.  And they said, "Well you've used your one phone call," so I said, "Well can my daughter use her one phone call," and they said yes.  And I called Jean Young [Jean Childs Young], Andy Young's wife, and she got in touch with my husband's secr- secretary and they came--they got in touch with Daddy King and then they came out to the jail and they told them that we were not there.  But Daddy Ca- King came about midnight and he came with someone, he knew the ropes.  Someone--you couldn't have a mortgage on your property to pay somebody's bail, it had to be free and clear.  So he brought a gentleman whose property was free and clear, and he put up his property for me and the four children to get bailed out of jail.  And you--and this was Mother's Day.
Speaker 1: This was 1963?
Speaker 2: It must've been.  Let me see, must've been '63 [1963], 'cause the March on Washington was '63 [1963] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Three [1963], right.
Speaker 2: Mus- may have been '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 608813
Speaker 1: The Birmingham campaign in 1963, now did you--was it--you all--they, they didn't put, put the children [Patrice Walker Powell, Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr., Robert Walker and Earl Walker] actually in jail is what you're saying, right?
Speaker 2: I don't think they put us in a cell.  If they did they put the four of us together, yeah.
Speaker 1: But somebody did come and get you outta there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] came and it was after midnight when he got there with this gentleman.  Then I had to go back to court for the trial and they found me guilty and charged me--fined me eighty-four dollars.  And I said I'm not paying eighty-four dollars, and so they put me in a cell.  The sheets were nice and clean, so I said well I'll get a good rest in here (laughter).  But that day, that afternoon or evening, my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] was coming from Birmingham [Alabama] and Bob Brown [Robert J. Brown], I don't know if you know Bob Brown, the name Bob Brown.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I do.
Speaker 2: From High Point, North Carolina.  I think he was with the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] administration or something like that.  Anyhow, he and my husband were coming from Birmingham and my husband saw my car and he said, "Oh my wife is in jail here."  So he and Bob Brown came and they paid my bail and I got out.
Story_ID: 608814
Speaker 1: What about the March on Washington?  Do you remember how that developed and did you go?
Speaker 2: I went.  Yes.  And, and the picture that you see Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] at the podium and Mrs. King and Mrs. Abernathy [Juanita Jones Abernathy] and myself.  But you--no you don't recognize 'cause you can't see us really.  But you just, I think I had on my gloves.  I think you can see my gloves.  But we went and it was--it was magnificent.  When he finished his speech I had tears in my eyes and I wanted to say Mrs.--to Mrs. King, you know, Coretta, he--you know, it was beautiful.  But I was so full I couldn't say anything to her.
Speaker 1: Now were you very good friends with Coretta Scott King?
Speaker 2: Not very good friends, but we were friends, you know, because our husbands were associates, yeah, we were friends.  And the children would go to the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], the, the Hunter Street Y [sic. Butler Street YMCA, Atlanta, Georgia] and swim together with Dr. King and his kids.  But we weren't, you know, buddy buddies.
Story_ID: 608815
Speaker 1: Were you in Birmingham [Alabama] when the church [16th Street Baptist Church] was bombed?
Speaker 2: No, we had come to New York [New York] then.
Speaker 1: Later on?
Speaker 2: Oh wait, no--
Speaker 1: That--that would've been the September right after the march [March on Washington].
Speaker 2: Then we were--no we were not in Birming- I was not in Birmingham then.  I thought--I don't remember whether we were in New York, 'cause we left--we left in '64 [1964] to go to New York, in July of '64 [1964].  So we must've been in New York, if that was September of '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: No this was '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Okay, then we were in Atlanta [Georgia] then.
Speaker 1: Oh you were in Atlanta rather--may--maybe you were in Atlanta rather than Birmingham then?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I wasn't in Birmingham then.  No, I was--I was probably in Atlanta, 'cause that's where we lived.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  So during the height of the problems in Birmingham, you were mostly in Atlanta anyway?
Speaker 2: Mostly in Atlanta, except for that one time that I went to Birmingham and I haven't been back since.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you haven't been back again period since, okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 608816
Speaker 1: Now '64 [1964] you moved to New York, you said?
Speaker 2: We moved to New York in July of '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: That's the year of the New York World's Fair, I think '64 [1964] that was going on.  But I don't know what--it doesn't have any reference.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we probably took the children, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do, do you remember that?
Speaker 2: I remember it yeah.  My father [Willard Edwards] probably came, you know, probably took the children.  We all probably went to the fair.  I know we went several times, yeah.  But when we went to New York, the North, we looked for a house.  We called the fair housing commission and told them how much we had for a down--you know, to pay for it, make the down payment, what we wanted.  Wanted four bedrooms at least and a dining room, and they got a German lady to make the calls so they would have some houses ready when we were coming that weekend, my daughter [Patrice Walker Powell] was in a wedding in Petersburg [Virginia] that weekend.  So we came--that was the weekend we chose to go to New York to look for a place to live.  Some places wouldn't allow us to look--well one place the lady wouldn't allow us to look at her house.  And so we sued the real estate agency, but she got a slap on the wrist.  She had to post a sign that said they did not discriminate, you know, and I think she had to leave it up for two years or something like that.  But this was in New York.
Speaker 1: Were you surprised at all coming back to New York?
Speaker 2: I was surprised--I was surprised.  Yeah, I was very surprised.  And where we lived in Yonkers [New York] was a big country segregated town.  They were still fighting the, the--what is it the--for the schools to be integrated, they were still fighting against that.  I guess maybe the year--'til the year before we left, that was 2003.
Speaker 1: So people that think that civil rights struggle was just in the South are wrong, right?
Speaker 2: Oh they're wrong.  In the North it's sneaky.  You know, people are sneaky.  In the South you know what you're supposed to do and what you can't do--what you can do and what you can't do.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now how did you like New York City [New York, New York]?  You, you grew up in New Jersey, right, so was it?
Speaker 2: I loved New York.  I loved New York 'cause you could take the train and go to see the shows.  And my friends would get the train and go for lunch in the city.  I love New York.  I miss all my friends, especially.  But I like--I like Chester [Virginia], the people are very nice here.  But I, I liked New York.  My husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] and I would go to the city, maybe get there about ten o'clock at night and walk around the streets when we first got there.  But when we left, you couldn't do that.

Speaker 1: When he became pastor of Canaan Baptist Church [Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, New York, New York], now was--is there--now he had been pastor of a church before.  Wh- what is it like--well just te- tell us your perspective on being a pastor's wife, when your husband is a high profile pastor like Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker]?
Speaker 2: Those people at Canaan Baptist Church were the most wonderful people I have ever met.  They--some, some ministers' wives want to be into everything.  We lived in Westchester [Westchester County, New York] and I did not want to be into everything because my husband was so--his personality was so strong, you know, he was--he said he was a benevolent dictator, but his personality was so strong I figured they didn't need two people, you know, like that.  And that was not really me anyway.  But they let me be me.  They accepted me just as I was.  And they--I have never met such lovely people in my life.
Speaker 1: Is there a hi- a highlight to your stay in New York, I mean in term, term, terms of the church for Canaan Baptist?
Speaker 2: Well, my husband put elevators in, that was (laughter).  I, I think they said that was the first elevators east of the Mississippi in a church.  There were so many highlights, Nelson Mandela's visit to the church.  We had a lot of high profile people come to the church.  We had--
Speaker 1: Now, now did you accompany Reverend Walker on these trips to South Africa and Egypt and other places (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some of them--some of them.  My job was very good to me.  They allowed me to go most places.  Sometimes I just couldn't go, but most of the time they would allow me to go.  And I think I've been to about sixty some countries, to the Holy Land about ten times.  So I would go, you know, most of the time I would go.
Story_ID: 608818
Speaker 1: When was it that you started working again, you know, were you?
Speaker 2: I didn't start working until my, my youngest child [Earl Walker] was sixteen years old.  And then my mother [Mabel Burke Edwards] gave me a fit, you know, "You're gonna leave that child?  I never left you home."  But he was sixteen, you know, he was a young man, and he didn't give us trouble.  Our oldest child [Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr.] went to prison.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: With drugs and he was selling.  But he, he served eight years and he's fine now.  He works in a church, he's their, their audio, audio person.  He does all of the taping and whatnot at the church.  And he's fine now.  But he said when he walked into that prison, he said he knew that this was not the place that he should be and he was determined that he was gonna get himself together.
Speaker 1: So do you think that--do you have any thoughts about why--where he went wrong or what?
Speaker 2: Well, my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker], you know, like I said was high profile, high achiever, and he would win--he'd play golf, he would come home with these big trophies and whatnot.  Everything he did he had to excel.  So if my son came home with a little basketball trophy this high, you know, and we would make over it, but it's not the big one, you know, like your daddy has.  I think that had something to do with it.  And then my daughter was very like her daddy, a high achiever and whatnot.  And sometimes the little boys would come and say. "Ms. Walker [HistoryMaker Ann Walker], can Patty [Patrice Walker Powell] come out and play football."  Well he was--he was the boy--he was the oldest boy, and they should've been asking for him to come out and play football, though he was very athletic.  But I just think things like that.  And then I want to say, I guess all mothers when their children get in trouble say peer pressure.  So he was going to this white school that he had never been in and I guess trying to fit in, that's why I say peer pressure.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  The change of environment maybe from, okay from Birmingham [Alabama]--I mean from Atlanta [Georgia] to New York?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Atlanta was all black schools.
Story_ID: 608819
Speaker 1: Where did you start working when you came to New York (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I started working at--for North American Philips [North American Philips Company; Philips Electronics North America Corporation] in Mount--Mount--managing their branch in Mount Vernon, New York, which I loved.
Speaker 1: All right, so you started as a branch manager in?
Speaker 2: There, yeah, uh-huh.  I worked there--for them fourteen years.
Speaker 1: Well what were your duties, you're a branch manager and--of a?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and financial counselor, I wore several hats.  And a financial counselor to the employees.  I was manager of their credit union.  So a loan officer, I did it all.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you're there for, for fourteen years?
Speaker 2: Fourteen years.  And I was in that office by myself.  And if I traveled, they would send someone from the home office in Fort Wayne, Indiana up to cover my office.  So they were very, you know, very good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let's see.  Now have you written about any of your experiences in the civil rights movement so far?
Speaker 2: No.  I never thought--my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] did so much writing, I, I didn't do any.
Speaker 1: And when you, and you all retired from the church in what 1990--
Speaker 2: Well he retired in 2002 after he had the four strokes and he couldn't function anymore.  So that's when he retired and they made him pastor emeritus [of Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, New York, New York].  That's what he is now.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and you are retired from Philips?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took early retirement in 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there--
Speaker 2: I mean when I became sixty-two.
Speaker 1: Now di- did you experience any prejudice at the corporate level at Philips or any?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: As a woman, a black woman (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was a few of them just a little, you know, you just ignore them, you know, if they don't affect your work or affect you really.  Just a little, not much, no.  And I think--I think I was their only branch--black branch manager for a while, and then when I went to one of the conventions or one of the--yeah, conventions that they had for the branch managers, I met another black lady from New York City [New York, New York].  But she stole the money or something, and then they, they wanted me to go to that branch, but I would have to take the train to New York City and it was, you know it's expensive to take the train back and forth.  And I said well if you pay my fare I'll go, but I really didn't wanna go 'cause it was too far.  But they didn't wanna pay my fare, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you--I guess when you consider everything that you've done up to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I can't--I can't think of anything that I would have done differently.  Whatever I did, the children were in the back of my mind.  And I don't think there's anything that I would have done differently.  I don't know what I could have done differently, even with the boy in trouble [Walker's oldest son, Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr.], I don't, you know, I, I feel that I did all I could do and all I knew how to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I didn't have any, you know, I felt bad about him being, you know, in prison and whatnot.  But I felt that I had done all I could do.

Speaker 1: Throughout the-- your involvement with SC- SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and that whole period of time, were there--who are some of the, I guess, the individuals that stand out to you as being the most outstanding or that you, you know, fought (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know someone who is a unsung hero and maybe you can look into him, Andy--Dr. William G. Anderson.  He was in Albany and his home was the center of the meetings when they were not in the churches, in Albany, Georgia.  He was run out of Albany and he is now in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, now in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And Andy, I'm sure Andy has--I know Andy has a story to tell.
Speaker 1: Okay, I hope he's still there.
Speaker 2: He's still there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well we sh- we certainly should try to interview him.  Dr. William G. Anderson, okay, all right.  So he was--his focus was--when--what did they call that the Albany--
Speaker 2: The Albany Movement.
Speaker 1: --Movement, Albany Movement.  Okay, any--anybody else?
Speaker 2: Have you interviewed Dorothy Cotton?
Speaker 1: No.  That's somebody too, yeah, she's from the Petersburg improvement organization [Petersburg Improvement Association].
Speaker 2: Yeah, she lives in--I'll give you her address and phone number.  She's in Ithaca, New York.
Speaker 1: Is James Woods still around?
Speaker 2: James--Jim Wood is dead.  Dorothy is writing a book, and she called not too long ago to ask me did I know what happened to him.  I just know he died.  I don't know where his wife is or his children.  I know he had four or five children.  I don't know what happened to them, but I know he died.
Speaker 1: Did you have an impression of Ella Baker when she was with SCLC?
Speaker 2: I only met Ella Baker, I didn't really know Ella Baker.  I just knew that she was, you know, there when my hus- jus- she had preceded him [Walker's husband, HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker].  But all I hear of her, she was an excellent person, especially for the students.    Yeah, she was a--the strength and guided them as much as she could, yeah.  Now she has a godchild in New York who was a member of our church [Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, New York, New York].  I don't know how close Lenora [A. Lenora Taitt Magubane] was to Ella.  But I can--you can get in touch with her if you want to.
Story_ID: 608821
Speaker 1: Now do you remember what you were doing when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had-as my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] said he had just installed my husband in the church [Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, New York, New York] ten days before and after the installation and all the--everything that went along with it, we went to California.  And we had just come back from California that day, that evening, and when we walked in the house my son said--my husband says my son said, you know, somebody called and said Dr. King had been shot.  So we turned on the television and sure enough he had been shot.  And my husband had to go to speak in Montclair, New Jersey or someplace in New Jersey and so he had to go.  So he went and on the way there, on the car radio he heard that Dr. King had died.  And so he called home and we both cried on the phone together, and then he went on to this engagement to speak.  And he said they had--they did not know that he had died and they didn't wanna announce until after he spoke.  And he said it was so hard for him to speak that night, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any stories about Dr. King that you can share with us or any?
Speaker 2: No, but I'll tell you my husband did, you know, did his funeral and we went on--my husband was do--was, was Nelson Rockefeller's urban affairs specialist, and so my child--the two older children [Patrice Walker Powell and Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr.] and myself went down on Rockefeller's plane to the funeral.  And I'm trying to think, what's the girl whose--was married to the fella with the blue eyes that just died?  They were on the plane and all these big stars were on the plane and they were--they weren't--I, I just felt so badly about Dr. King being shot, but they were laughing and talking, you know.  Coming back, I don't think going down, coming back they had the bar open and everything.  I thought that was kind of strange.
Speaker 1: These are the celebrities that went down--
Speaker 2: Paul Newman, and what's his wife's--
Speaker 1: You're talking about Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward.
Speaker 2: Joanne--those people, you know, were on the plane.  And I, I just, you know, I guess that's not how blacks celebrate- celebrated death back in that--in that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Their, their reaction to it was much different from black people (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah. I thought.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting insight.
Story_ID: 608822
Speaker 1: Were you all involved in the Poor People's Campaign and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, we had gone to New York by that time.
Speaker 1: And Nelson Rockefeller was running for president I think in '68 [1968], and had a pretty good campaign going?
Speaker 2: Yeah I went to my--I mean to--my mo- with my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] to the Democratic Convention in Miami [1972 Democratic National Convention, Miami, Florida].  And then when he became vice president, my husband went on a mission to South America with him and we went up to their house for Happy's [Margaretta Fitler Murphy Rockefeller] birthday and went up there--oh and then they had a, a cookout for all the people who went on the mission to South America and their wives, so we went to that.  But we went to his place, the vice presidential home in--what is it--in--outside of Washington [D.C].  We've been there, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a pretty good working relationship with Nelson Rockefeller?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sorry my husband didn't get to tell you about Attica [Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York], and when he went to Attica for Rockefeller.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, the Attica pr- prison riot.  Oh yeah, it's a big rebellion, I don't know what, what you'd call it but it was a big mess out there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my husband said--I think he said Bobby Douglass [Robert R. Douglass] told my--told Rockefeller not to come.  And my husband said he told him to come, and he said even if it won't do any good, at least you will have made an appearance.  And he didn't come.  And I think they shot--so killed so many and they found out it was the policemen who had shot and killed the people, yeah, yeah.  My husband said he thought that hurt him from being elected president.
Speaker 1: Yeah it was one intense moment, I, I remember that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My husband went up there.  He had just had back surgery, spinal surgery and he went.  And he stayed up there several days.  But it was very tense he said.  But he had to come back on Sunday for the church service [at Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, New York, New York].  But, it was terrible he said.

Speaker 1: There weren't any riots in Harlem [New York, New York] after King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed I don't believe?
Speaker 2: After King was killed?
Speaker 1: Were, were there?
Speaker 2: I think there were.  Yeah, I think there were, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How did you--do you have any reflections on the Harlem community there in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: I liked Harlem.  Yeah I liked Harlem.  We could go anywhere you wanted to go in Harlem.
Speaker 1: Were, were you all friends with Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: My husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker] was at Abyssinian [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York] when aban- when Adam could not come to Harlem, remember they had the case with the bag lady [Esther James] and Adam could not come to his church and so he asked my husband to take over the services.  He had two services and my husband took over the tw- the morning service and the eleven o'clock service and the early service.  And as I understand it, he was too popular and Adam dismissed him.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.  Now what was the case with the bag lady, he mentioned that and I don't--I'm not familiar with that?
Speaker 2: It, it was something she wanted him to retract what he had said about her and that's why he could not come to Harlem because he refused to do it.  And they had the law, was that he--if he had retracted what he had said about her, he would not have been arrested.  But since he wouldn't retract it, somehow he was--he would be arrested if he put foot in Harlem or maybe in New York, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's Adam Clayton Powell, okay (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so he could not come on Sundays and so he asked my husband to do services.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah I remember something about him being--couldn't come back.  Did--did you all meet Malcolm X?
Speaker 2: I never met Malcolm X--Malcolm X.  I was friends with his wife, Betty [Betty Shabazz]. She was a Link [The Links, Incorporated].  And we were friends that way.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that--that's interesting, you know, she--she become a Link.
Speaker 2: She and her daughter, Ilyasah [HistoryMaker Ilyasah Shabazz] came in at the same time.
Story_ID: 608824
Speaker 1: Well, tell us some--something about your involvement with, with The Links [The Links, Incorporated] and what The Links do?
Speaker 2: The Links is a group of professional women, you must have had service in the--to your community before you can become a member.  And you have to be resp- be sponsored by a member in order to come in.  But you must have demonstrated that you have served your community in a positive way.  And they were a nice group of ladies.
Speaker 1: So it doesn't matter what kind of organization you've been involved in as long as you were doing something for the community?
Speaker 2: That I understand was the primary cri- criteria, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you're still involved (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a service organization.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and what kind of services does The Links provide?
Speaker 2: They have four facets, service to youth, service to the arts, international service, and national service, I've forgotten the exact language now.  But those are their four areas that they participate in and they do a good job.  We built schools in South Africa.  Each chapter, as I understand it, had to be responsible for at least one school.  And I think it only cost ten thousand dollars to build a school.  Some chapters built more than one school.  I think they did wellbores for water in South Africa, and do a lot of good work.
Story_ID: 608825
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well just what The HistoryMakers are doing.  I don't think--there's so many people, even--I'm saying, not just the young people, but older people who don't know what went on during the time of the movement and the young people think things are like they are now, think they have been like that all along, they just don't know.  And I think they need to know.  And I still--and I think still now, you know, we still have segregation and I think anytime you see segregation rearing its ugly head you need to confront it.
Story_ID: 608826
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point again today, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think I was a good mother.  I think I was a good minister's wife, supported my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker].  And I think I was a, a good--good person, a good community person.  I supported a lot, volunteer work, you know, I did a lot of volunteer work.  And I did what I could but I had the four children [Patrice Walker Powell, Wyatt Tee Walker, Jr., Robert Walker and Earl Walker] don't forget, so there wasn't but so much I could do.  But I think I've lived a pretty good varied life, and I think I have given a lot of service.  So I'm proud of that.  Helped a lot of people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your, your parents [Mabel Burke Edwards and Willard Edwards] get a chance to see you involved in this career and civil rights and otherwise?
Speaker 2: Like I said when we went on the Freedom Rides I didn't tell them, no.  You know what happened while I was in jail, I missed my children so much and I sent them a letter.  And on the letter you had to put Hinds County jail [Hinds County Detention Center, Jackson, Mississippi] on the outside of the letter.  When I say my grandmother, she said to me I was so embarrassed that I got a letter from the jail (laughter).  She didn't, I mean she had no clue.
Speaker 1: So, it's interesting to see, you know, we look to--yeah, you all were rebels in those days.  You were like young people pushing up or--on--yeah.
Speaker 2: But she was so embarrassed to have a letter come to her house with Hinds County jail on the address.  But she didn't know and we didn't tell her what we were doing.
Speaker 1: So do you think teaching this history is important?
Speaker 2: I think so, very important.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything I haven't asked you we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and just to be clear, I think--I think you mentioned before, but, but we're--you're here in--this is not Petersburg [Virginia], but--
Speaker 2: Chester.
Speaker 1: --Chester, Virginia, basically retired because you, you know, you know a lot of people in this area and family in this area.
Story_ID: 608827
Speaker 1: The last question is like legacy, but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as having done the best I could do with what I had.  I think I did do the best I could do, as far as service.  I did do the best I could do.  And I, I feel satisfied that I did whatever I could to help people.

Speaker 1: That's Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and my husband just in the office at SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's the first graduating class of Virginia University [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] and that's my husband's father [John Wise Walker] on the right, I don't know who the rest of them are.  That was, I think he said, 1899.
Speaker 2: This is a senior housing building named after my husband that he built in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: That's Jackie Robinson and my husband visiting a burned out church.  I don't know whether it was in Georgia or Alabama.
Speaker 2: Those are my husband's mug shots from Mississippi and that poster is from a play ['Walking with Walker'] that was done about him by the charter school in Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: That's the souvenir book given out at my husband's retirement celebration from the church.
Speaker 2: The left is my husband's high school graduation.  The top right is him getting out of jail in Petersburg [Virginia] after the library sit-in and that's me in the hat and the pocketbook.  On the left bottom that's his brothers and sisters, and his dad in the middle and a nephew.  And that's his dad installing him at the church in Petersburg [Gillfield Baptist Church].
Speaker 1: That's--I just know that's Dr. King and my husband, I don't know.  I guess it's taken in the office at SCLC or at a meeting.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Dr. King when he installed my husband at Canaan [Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, New York, New York] ten days before he was shot and killed.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's--those two ladies are the cast, are actual participants from the library sit-ins, and the gentleman is also I believe, and my husband.  They were at a preview of the play.
Speaker 2: And that was the cast and they all autographed that picture.
Speaker 1: Oh that's his last book ['African Presence in the Bible and Other Essays,' Wyatt Tee Walker].
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that's the picture, uh-huh.  That's the picture taken by Dr. King, I think the only published picture taken by him in the Birmingham jail of my husband, yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: And that's the picture taken--that's a picture of Dr. King taken by Wyatt Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker].  They were in the Birmingham jail together.
Speaker 1: It's 1967.
Speaker 2: Seven [1967], uh-huh. (pause)  And then Dr. King turned to him and said, "Now Wyatt let me take you."
