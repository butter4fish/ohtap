Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warm up.  And the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Probably turnip greens (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh, spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?

Speaker 1: Okay.  I think you're right, too.
Story_ID: 638231
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Leroy McCollins] side.  But we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Lorene White McCollins.  L-O-R-E-N-E, W-H-I-T-E, McCollins, M-C-C-O-L-L-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is February 9, 1924.  And she was born in Water Valley, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Water Valley.  Now, what is that near?
Speaker 2: Memphis [Tennessee] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Memphis, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Not too far from Memphis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, near Holly Springs [Mississippi] and all that?
Speaker 2: Probably, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And well, can--what can you tell us about her side of the family, about the Whites I guess?  How far back can that side go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my mother's mother and father were Leonard [Leonard White] and Addie White [Addie Manuel White].  They were married in Water Valley, and if I'm not mistaken, they were married in like 1919, 1918.  And they migrated to Memphis probably in the '40s [1940s].  My mother was the first and only college graduate in her family.  She finished high school in Water Valley.  I think she attended Jackson State College [Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] for a couple of years, and then she transferred to LeMoyne College [Memphis, Tennessee], which is now LeMoyne-Owen [LeMoyne-Owen College], but it was LeMoyne College then.  My grandmother never worked.  She was always--well, I should say she never worked outside of the house.  She was a homemaker.  She bore eight children.  My grandfather, after he left farming in Mississippi, became an employee of the Illinois Central Railroad.  And there, he worked--I guess he was a mechanic or an engineer.  Well, not an engineer, but a mechanic.  He helped fix the cars, and the trains and the tracks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he what they called a brakeman?
Speaker 2: A what?
Speaker 1: A brakeman?
Speaker 2: Maybe, I don't know.
Speaker 1: I know that seems to be a common job with black men.
Speaker 2: I guess so.
Speaker 1: It had something to do with the maintenance of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he went to work at 7:00, and he was home every day by 3:00 or 3:30, like clockwork.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Are there any other stories about your family prior to your grandparents?  Do you know anything else about that side?
Speaker 2: I knew my grandmother's father, and his name was James Manuel.  And he died I guess when I was about thirteen or fourteen.  But I visited him in Water Valley, Mississippi quite a bit.  Well, you know, when my grandmother was still--when he was still living, my grandmother would take me down there to visit her dad.  And--
Speaker 1: Did they tell any stories about what life was like for them, and how the family got there, or what--the end of slavery or any of that stuff?
Speaker 2: He really didn't.  My grandparents talked to me, you know, quite a bit about life as they call it in the country.  Mississippi was called the country.  And they talked about farming and sharecropping, and that kind of thing.  But there were never, never any stories that I can really, I can remember about slavery or--
Speaker 1: Or even Reconstruction and those things?
Speaker 2: I really can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, my father died when I was, you know, eleven or twelve, maybe thirteen.  So I just wasn't, I can't remember them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638232
Speaker 1: I was asking you off camera if--that you said your--the people on your mother's [Lorene White McCollins] side were Baptist (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah.  We grew up, I grew up Baptist.  My mother was Baptist.  Her, her parents were Baptist.  My fa- grandfather [Leonard White] was a Baptist deacon.  My grandmother [Addie Manuel White] was a mother, you know, on the mother's board.  So, we grew up, I grew up in that church from the time I was born, St. Jude Missionary Baptist Church [Memphis, Tennessee].  So, that is, that's--I suspect that the Baptist church is about the only church my mother's side of the family was--you know, I think that that's their membership.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, did your mother tell you any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  You know, my mother just talks about, you know, farming, and how she hated it, and how she always looked for ways not to have to pick cotton.  She pretended that she was hurt or sick or something, so that she did not have to do the hard labor that her sisters and brothers did.  Her sisters and brothers jokingly called her the prissy one.  She hated it, and you know, and she talked about how they were treated in the South.  One of the most provocative stories and compelling stories that I can remember is that they said my grandmother--my grandmother actually gave birth to nine children.  And the ninth one is the one who died at birth.  And it was just felt that the doctor, the white doctor that came to the house, was in a hurry, and he took the baby and kind of pulled it out, and it was felt that it was kind of a senseless death.  And she remembers how my grandfather took the baby and put it in a shoebox and buried it out in the backyard.  So, I mean, you know, those kinds of little stories were very--made a lasting impact on me, just talking about some of the discrimination and some of the things they went through, that she went through as a child.  She talks about the one room schoolhouse of course, and how they were taught, and how at one point her older sisters taught in the--you know, taught school.  And it's funny, because they never went to college.  These sisters never went to college, but at one point they were used as schoolteachers.
Speaker 1: So that kind of says something about the community, the state of the community in those days.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: The access to education.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 638233
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Lorene White McCollins] talk about why she wanted to be educated so, so bad?
Speaker 2: My mother (laughter) wanted to be educated I think because she hated menial work.  She, you know, she's--and she just came--she fell--her birth order was right.  She had two older brothers and two older sisters.  And she, she somehow was able to go to Jackson College [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] when she graduated.  I think her older sisters got married like right away.  So she had these two older brothers in college, I mean in the [U.S.] Army by then.  So, her birth order was just about right.  So if anybody would go, it perhaps would be her.  And so she went to Jackson State and then, as I said, when the family moved to Memphis [Tennessee] she was able to transfer.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, so she finished at LeMoyne [LeMoyne College; LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: She finished at LeMoyne, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what did she major in?
Speaker 2: I think she was an English major, as was I.  Yeah, she majored in English.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, so did she write for--I mean did she--?
Speaker 2: No, she--
Speaker 1: Did she teach or did she write?
Speaker 2: She taught.  She was a schoolteacher, you know, she taught school from the very beginning, which was about what people of color did, African Americans did.  They were, you know, some were fortunate enough to be doctors or lawyers, but--dentists.  But the average, you know, college graduate came back and taught school. Um-hm. And she taught for thirty plus years.
Story_ID: 638234
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Leroy McCollins.  He did not have a middle name.  Leroy, L-E-R-O-Y, M-C-C-O-L-L-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, L-E-R-O-I?
Speaker 2: L-E-R-O-Y.
Speaker 1: Y, okay, Y (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) L-E-R-O-Y, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  McCollins, okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth was December 24, 1919, I think.  I think it was 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Oakland, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Is that nearby?
Speaker 2: It's not far from Water Valley [Mississippi].  You know, down in--all of those places are not far from Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what can you tell us about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: You know, my father was not very close to his family.  But his father was Davis McCollins.  His mother was Mattie [Mattie McCollins], M-A-T-T-I-E.  They had twelve children, and they farmed.  They lived and died in Oakland, they never moved.  They lived out on that, as they called it, the homestead, you know, a shanty house with the chickens running through and all of that.  That was not my favorite place to visit as a child, but we went there occasionally.
Story_ID: 638235
Speaker 1: Now, did they [Flake's paternal grandparents, Mattie McCollins and Davis McCollins] own their land out there [Oakland, Mississippi]?  Or was it--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, they owned their land.
Speaker 1: Okay. As di- now, did your mother's [Lorene White McCollins] family own their land as well?
Speaker 2: In Miss- in Water Valley [Mississippi]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I assume so.  I never heard them say that they--I assume that they did, yes.
Speaker 1: So, both families were lucky in that respect.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There were a lot of sharecroppers in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And my grandmother's [Addie Manuel White] sister, who stayed in Water Valley, on my mother's side, she--they had a beautiful house, a beautiful old house.  And while--again, they never worked.  I assume that they somehow managed to acquire properties.  And beautiful--I remember that old house, big old house.  I didn't mind going to her house.  It was my daddy's [Leroy McCollins] family I (laughter) didn't like to go visit, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had the outdoor toilets and everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But your mother's family had indoor--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Aunt Doll [ph.] did, my, my grandmother's sister, uh-huh.  She had a beautiful home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638236
Speaker 1: Now are there any stories that passed down from your father's [Leroy McCollins] side about, you know--?
Speaker 2: The only thing that I can remember is that my father had some older brothers who had to leave town.  And you know, nobody ever said why.  But I don't know if--I don't think it was anything like any brutal crimes, like murder or anything, but I think it had more to do with having done something or said something that offended the authorities down there, and they had to leave town.  So they--his brothers went to Detroit [Michigan] from Oakland [Mississippi] and never, ever returned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not even sure they came to my grandparents' [Mattie McCollins and Davis McCollins] funeral.  If they did, you know, they came and they left.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a common story in a lot of families where relatives leave because of--and as you said, it didn't have to be a big crime.
Speaker 2: Oh, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It could just be an insult.
Speaker 2: It could have been an insult or--
Speaker 1: --to some--
Speaker 2: --something.
Speaker 1: --powerful authority figure.
Speaker 2: Some infraction.  That's right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And they, you know, they had nothing else--all they could do was leave.
Speaker 2: Right.  And they left town and they, and they couldn't come back.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, rather than suffer whatever humiliation, they would leave.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So they went to Detroit?  Okay.
Speaker 2: They went to Detroit.
Story_ID: 638237
Speaker 1: Did your dad [Leroy McCollins] have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: My father?  No, he finished eleventh grade and joined the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was in, what was that?  World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.  Okay, now the Navy.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: This is interesting, because there weren't a lot of black men that--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --served in the Navy.
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: And the ones I've talked to, the Navy was rough.  And they, well, they did kitchen work.  They tried to keep them in the kitchen, you know.
Speaker 2: And my father was a cook; my father was a cook.  He even owned a restaurant [Zanzibar (ph.)] at one point in his life, shortly after the Navy.  So, that may be very true.  You know, my father was never one to complain, and he was not a big talker.  But he referred to his life in the Navy, you know, the ship and the travels.  But I never really heard him say what he did in the Navy.  But I suspect it was cooking, because he was a major cook.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a major cook.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, he never, he never really complained about that experience in the war?
Speaker 2: He never complained about it.  He, you know, he would make reference, "Yeah, when I was in the Navy, I did this, and I--," you know, but he never really talked about it being particularly hard or discriminatory.  He really, he just didn't.
Speaker 1: Now, did he serve in the Pacific or the Atlantic, or--?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: I really, I don't know; I don't know.  I know he was on ships.  He may have done a little of both, but I know he talked about being at sea and traveling.  You know, he traveled quite a bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he never really talked about the discrimination part.  But then he wasn't a big talker.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did he, what did he end up doing for a living?
Speaker 2: What he ended up doing is, in Memphis [Tennessee] there were some bases, like Mallory Air Force base [Mallory Air Force Depot, Memphis, Tennessee] is where he worked.  And he was, I guess he would call him a civil servant or something.  He, he worked on the base although he was not in the armed forces at that time.  But he did work.  And he was a painter.  He painted parts of ships, I mean parts of machinery or whatever.  And sometimes he painted houses and barracks.  But he was a painter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember ironing those ova- what do they call?  Overalls, coveralls?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were ironed.  That's pretty--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --pretty good.
Speaker 2: My mother [Lorene White McCollins] made me iron them.
Story_ID: 638238
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My father [Leroy McCollins] owned this restaurant called the Zanzibar [ph.].  And somehow she went in the Zanzibar, and that's kind of how they met.  And it's funny.  My aunt married the other partner, my Uncle John [ph.].  So he owned this restaurant with the two, these two men.  And my mother [Lorene White McCollins] married my father, and my aunt married the other partner.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story behind the name Zanzibar?  This is an African name, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know what?  I, I don't even know.  I didn't even, I didn't even think about it being--because that was not a part of my--they had sold it by the time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they got married and everything.  But no, I don't know.  I suspect that they may have just purchased it.  I don't know, I really don't know.
Story_ID: 638239
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities--their talents, their dispositions--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: In many ways, I think I take after my father [Leroy McCollins].  Now, my father, I often say if my father had had the opportunity to finish high school and go to college, he would have been a bad brother.  He was, he was, he was certainly a force to be reckoned with anywhere.  My father read every newspaper.  He looked at the news.  He would, he would talk about everything.  The joke is that when my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake] was in [U.S.] Congress, my daddy was telling him what he needed to do--how he needed--you know, because my father just saw himself as one who was well informed, and who knew how to solve the problems of the world.  I really think that had my dad been able--you know, been from a more affluent family, and really had an opportunity to go to college, he would have been, he would have been a real trailblazer.  He is, he, and he was always good at seeing the bigger picture, you know, for me.  He, he, could analyze a situation, and sometimes his analyses were a bit unorthodox.  But you, but I just kind of always felt he saw the bigger picture.  So, on one level I'm, I think I'm like my dad, you know, got an opinion about everything and try to keep abreast of many things.  My father was the kind of man who would have the news--he, sometimes he'd have two or three TVs in his room, because he'd be watching the ballgame, the news.  And you know, he just liked to kind of know and be in the know.  And so, he--I just hate that he was never able to go further.  And my mother [Lorene White McCollins] on the other hand is a very refined lady, very much into clothes, you know, and looking the part.  She was a hard, hard, worker.  She's a hard worker at school.  She was a hard worker in her church [St. Jude Missionary Baptist Church, Memphis, Tennessee].  So, I kind of get that from her.  The church--the commitment to church and the things of God, I get from her.  And my father did not, wouldn't even join the church until I was well grown, because he was Methodist, and we were members of a Baptist church.  And the Baptist church said that you had to be baptized by a Baptist preacher.  And he said, "I've been baptized, so I'm not going to be baptized again."  So, I guess I was well into my twenties when he finally decided that he would go and be baptized, and he joined my church.
Story_ID: 638240
Speaker 1: Do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're the only child?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, quite a few.
Speaker 1: What's the very first thing?  Is there anything that's a first memory that you can think of?
Speaker 2: I remember we had this little--what do you--duplex house.  I remember that house.  I remember breaking my leg, and my mother [Lorene White McCollins] having to let me stay with my [maternal] grandma [Addie Manuel White] because it was hard to get me up the stairs to that little duplex, or wherever I lived at the time.  My grandmother had a house, it didn't have an outdoor toilet.  It had a toilet that was on the back porch.  So you had to kind of go out there to the bathroom.  But I remember it had a bridge.  You had to come up the bridge, because under the bridge was a--what do you call that?  A ditch, a ditch. So, from the street, you came up a bridge into my grandmother's front yard.  And my really fondest memories of my childhood would be playing in my grandmother's front yard.  I loved my grandmother's house; I just loved going there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because she cooked.  My mother wasn't such a great cook.  She was a great cook, she just didn't cook (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother cooked every day.
Story_ID: 638241
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this leads to probably some other mem- well, we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, my moth--my [maternal] grandmother's [Addie Manuel White] greens, cornbread, every meal.  Spaghetti, just a tremendous cook.  And I remember going to town with my grandmother to pay bills.  I remember her cooking biscuits and syrup, you know, for breakfast, I remember that.  But one of the things that I remember most was, you know, in those early '50s [1950s], as the nation was beginning to take a shift, I remember the time that we walked to town, because we boycotted, we were boycotting the buses.  I don't remember that year when the bus boycotts began in Memphis [Tennessee], but I remember that my grandmother was adamant that she would participate in that bus boycott.  And I remember walking.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is, yeah, this is interesting.  Because a lot of people think Montgomery [Alabama] was the only one.
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Because it's publicized more.
Speaker 2: No.  I remember, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I know they--
Speaker 2: --I remember we couldn't get Easter clothes one year.  And I remember that we boycotted at Christmastime, and so we didn't get the usual Christmas things, you know, toys.  So that year, I guess it started at around Christmas and carried through Easter.  But, and if I would go back and really try to pinpoint the year, I'm sure I could do that.  But that I remember my family participating in.  And I remember my mother [Lorene White McCollins] saying that she felt really guilty about not--you know, she felt very committed to the boycott and she thought about going, but then the guilt thing.  She said no, she was not going to break the picket lines.  But I do remember that.  I remember that vividly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The bus boycotts, and the stores (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know there was one in New Orleans [Louisiana], too, that doesn't get written about.
Speaker 2: Well, that one in Memphis--
Speaker 1: So a lot of cities had them.
Speaker 2: And I mean, just coming on the heels of the death of Ben Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks].  See, Ben Hooks, Billy Kyles [HistoryMaker Reverend Samuel Billy Kyles], those were the guys leading the Civil Rights Movement there in Memphis.  So, yeah, I remember, I remember Ben Hooks vividly, too, and how, you know, they just--and some local preachers that, you know, that really voiced their commitment to the boycotts and the sit-ins.  So, that I remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a, I know there's a history of struggle in Memphis.  And I think for people that don't understand I guess what was going on in Memphis in those days--I was enlightened by interviewing some of the people from Memphis like Russell Sugarmon [HistoryMaker Russell B. Sugarmon] and some other people.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I remember him.
Speaker 1: That they, that the--
Speaker 2: He was one.  He was a name.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: A.W. Willis.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Willis, right, right.  That's right, A.W. Willis, the attorney.  And there was another--
Speaker 2: Maceo Walker [A. Maceo Walker].
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Turner, Jesse Turner, who was one of--what was it?  The president of the Tri-State Bank [Memphis, Tennessee], I think at that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, those guys were all--and you know, I grew up with their children.  So, we were right there.
Speaker 1: There was a strong black business and professional community there, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely. Absolutely.
Story_ID: 638242
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And there were rights that black people had in Memphis [Tennessee].  I mean for instance, you could vote, right, in Memphis?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I never knew that my parents couldn't vote.
Speaker 1: Where people were fighting to vote in Mississippi and some other places in the South, you could vote in Memphis (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's probably true, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I never knew my parents--and my daddy [Leroy McCollins] was the quintessential politician.  I mean he, he, like I said, politically--current events, he was up on everything.  So, he, he was a devoted and devout Democrat.  And it was just funny, you know.  He, he, was just one who just really felt that the salvation of black folks was the Democratic Party (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did.
Speaker 1: So, but, you know, there was--different people--if people think back and think about the South as being all one thing, they would be wrong, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: There was discrimination, but--
Speaker 2: Well, it was basically--you know, now I remember that my mother [Lorene White McCollins]--now she was one of the ones who would just voice--both my parents were rather feisty, and they would stand up to folks.  But I, I remember, you know, that my mother was just--when I was a little girl, we'd go downtown.  And she would, she wouldn't, she would beg me not to have to go to the bathroom, because she resented going to the (gesture) colored bathrooms.  And you know, no water, just--you know, "Okay, we're going downtown.  Use the bathroom and drink water, because we won't be stopping, and we won't be drinking water."  And if I by chance had to go, it was just like, oh, god.  I mean, she, her resentment was great.  So--
Speaker 1: When you were coming up, they had that colored and white--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --bathroom thing.
Speaker 2: In--
Speaker 1: And the water fountain thing.
Speaker 2: In the beginning, because I can remember that it was just--and she hated it.  I just remember she hated it.  And she voiced it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So as a child I was, you know, you just didn't go to the bathroom in public.  I think that's carried over for me now.  It's just, you know, I'd rather just not (laughter).  But, you know, you do.  But she just hated it.

Speaker 1: Okay, we were just talking about Mr. Withers [HistoryMaker Ernest Withers], a photographer, off camera.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But the black community in Memphis [Tennessee] had, was struggling, and had some things that some of the other communities did not have (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're right.  We had the Tri-State--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The Tri-State Defender, which was the black paper.  I even think we had two.  And seems like the Memphis World sticks out in my mind.  But we, I know we had one solid black newspaper, and I'm thinking we had two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, yeah, Memphis was--as now I'm out of Memphis and hear about other cities and what was going on, I think Memphis was not a bad place to be in the South, not as bad--and obviously Mississippi.  I can remember my uncles, you know, their thing in--if they had to drive through Mississippi, it was not to--"I have to stop and get gas."  This is what was really funny.  My uncles from Milwaukee [Wisconsin] would come to town with their late model cars.  And they would stop off in Memphis and get what we would call now, a hooptie.  Because they knew not to go into Mississippi driving a brand new car, because that would attract a lot of attention.  And they would be guilty, they would be victims of racial profiling.  So, my uncles from Milwaukee and wherever they--Michigan and Detroit [Michigan]--my father's brothers.  So when they would come to town, they would borrow--they would leave their new cars in Memphis, and then they would borrow somebody's not so new car to drive it into Mississippi to avoid--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's deep.  That's, that's--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, they realized that there was a dramatic difference between the two?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you had to--
Speaker 2: Memphis was a safer place.
Speaker 1: You could vote in Memphis, but you had housing discrimination and discrimination in transportation--
Speaker 2: Well, obviously, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and segregated schools and other things.  But it wasn't Mississippi.
Speaker 2: It wasn't Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, when you were growing up, a lot of the civil rights struggles started to reach the newspapers, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --television and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So at the time, were you aware of the historical importance of those things, when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, because my dad [Leroy McCollins] was very verbal about it to the degree that he was committed to the advancement of people of color.  He--and my mother [Lorene White McCollins], being a teacher, obviously was.  And then my friends' parents were, you know, of that same frame of mind.  So, and then I went to a school where we were taught by black teachers.
Story_ID: 638244
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, what was your first elementary school?
Speaker 1: I went to only one school for twelve years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Hamilton.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Hamilton Elementary [Hamilton Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee] and Hamilton High [Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Now, I think this is the first time I've heard about Hamilton.  And I mean I've interviewed a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, Hamilton is the school.
Speaker 2: --people that went to, what was that?  Manassas High School [Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: Manassas was in North Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee].  Hamilton is in South Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Okay.  And Booker T, was it Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: Booker T. Washington is kind of South Memphis, but it was more toward downtown.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Hamilton--A.W. Willis' daughter went to Hamilton.  And I'm trying to think.  A whole bunch of us went to Hamilton.  J.O. Patterson [J.O. Patterson, Sr.], founder of the--I mean, well, the--C.H. Mason [Charles Harrison Mason] was the founder of the Church of God in Christ, but J.O. Patterson was the presiding bishop, and his daughter [Janet Patterson Wheeler] and I went to school together.  So, you know, Hamilton was a cool school.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  All right, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It didn't have such a great football team all the time, but it was a great school.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Now did you have any favorite teachers I guess in school?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  I--yeah.  I mean from elementary to, from elementary to high school, I had a number of teachers.  Mrs.--I mean some of them nice, some of them hard.  But Miss Long [ph.], Miss Susie Jones [ph.], Mrs. Bartholomew [ph.], Edwina Patrick, all--you know.  And then in high school, I had just a number of teachers who instilled in us--I liked Miss Fentress [ph.], who I think is still, she may have retired by now.  But Miss Evans [ph.].  But these were some sharp ladies, great dressers, and they just kind of instilled in us a dignity, a desire.  I mean you just never--you never thought about not going to college.  Because they would come home, and they would be teachers in our high school, and they would--they just told us that that's where, where we were headed.  And so, that's where we, that's where we went.  So--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were great role models, in terms of the way they carried themselves, their decorum.  And most of them were in sororities and fraternities.  So, almost everybody in my class pledged something.  So, you know, it's just that kind of, that black middle class life that really primed us and shaped us and mold u- molded us.
Story_ID: 638245
Speaker 1: Now, was there, there a very large separation between the black middle class and the black, I guess, poor people?  Or--
Speaker 2: Well, I would--
Speaker 1: You know, everybody might not--you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would say yes and no.  Because you know, all of us, most of us who were fortunate enough, whose parents--who were fortunate enough to be the children of parents who went to college--we still had in our family, family members who didn't.  So, that level of discrimination, I can't remember it being--now, somebody on the other side of that may see different.  Plus, well, in addition, I went to church with--you know, the one thing that I say about many black churches is that, you know, you have a principal sitting on the deacon board with a janitor.  You have a nurse singing in the choir with a homemaker.  You have the children of doctors playing with the children of maintenance men in a hospital.  That was the beauty of the black church, especially a church like mine [St. Jude Missionary Baptist Church, Memphis, Tennessee].  We, we were never taught to, we certainly weren't taught to discriminate like that, because you would be discriminating against your own cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, my mom [Lorene White McCollins] was a teacher, but my cousin's mother, you know, my mother's sister, kept house for white people in North Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee].  So, and I loved my cousins and played with them, and loved to go to my aunt's house.  So, so, you know, it's, it's that--it just, it was just the reality.
Story_ID: 638246
Speaker 1: How would you describe your personality as a little girl growing up?  You were an only child, and so--
Speaker 2: Shy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were you interested in, and what--?
Speaker 2: Shy, liked to be to my- you know, I didn't mind being by myself, but in a way, desperate for friends.  Dreams, I wasn't a big dreamer.  I just assumed that one day I'd go to college and come back to Memphis [Tennessee] and teach like my mother [Lorene White McCollins] did.  And that was the only thing I knew to dream about.  I, I, never thought I could be a doctor, you know, academically, I didn't.  I was a good student, but science and math were not my forte, so going to college and coming back home to teach was about the extent of my dream.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we didn't take dancing lessons.  You know, back then there was no such thing as black girls taking dance lessons and playing tennis.  All we did was go to school and go to church.  We did a lot of social things, parties and--
Speaker 1: Parties?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Were they formal--more formal, or informal kind of things?
Speaker 2: Well, house parties.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, that's the--you came along in the era of a lot of good music.
Speaker 2: A lot of good music, a lot of good music.
Speaker 1: Now, the blues is going on in Memphis on one hand.  But you still had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, I wasn't into any blues.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, the younger generation.
Speaker 2: I was into The Temptations and the Four Tops, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, the Motown sound.
Speaker 2: Motown [Motown Records], absolutely.
Speaker 1: And you've also got, you know, Otis Redding and all of them, you know.
Speaker 2: That, '(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay.'
Speaker 1: It was the Memphis sound, The Bar-Kays--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, The Bar-Kays, I went to high school with.
Speaker 1: The Bar-Kays, The Marquees, and--
Speaker 2: Now, I don't remember The Marquees, but I remember The Bar-Kays.
Speaker 1: The Bar-Kays, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Carla Thomas went to my high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: I can remember Carla singing at the talent shows at Hamilton [Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Carla Thomas, now she's--
Speaker 2: Rufus, the daughter of Rufus Thomas (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Rufus Thomas' daughter.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you--she was ahead of you, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: She was a little bit ahead of you.
Speaker 2: She was ahead of me.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 2: She had a little sister named Vaneese [Vaneese Thomas], who I think was more my age.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Carla Thomas was there.  Who else?
Speaker 2: See, the original Bar-Kays--now if you remember, ooh, I don't remember those guys' names.  But they were from Hamilton.  A couple of them were from Hamilton.  I can remember them on the talent shows.  Cunningham [Carl Cunningham] is a name that kind of sticks out.  But, you know, some of them were killed in a plane crash.  Remember?  A car crash or plane crash (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, yes.  I do remember that, yeah.
Speaker 2: But The Bar-Kays, many of them came out of Hamilton, or one of them or two of them, I don't know.
Speaker 1: I think [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes, he came out of Manassas [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee], right?
Speaker 2: Right, I think so.
Speaker 1: But that was a big time for music.  So, yeah, were you--so you liked the music?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not a singer or anything, but we--and I wasn't into the blues.  But that Motown sound was the--
Speaker 1: So the younger generation, did they kind of look down on the blues?  They kind of--
Speaker 2: It just wasn't in our frame of reference, not mine anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, we wanted to dance.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the rest of the country, we'd always hear WLAC.
Speaker 2: W.C. Handy?
Speaker 1: No, WLAC Radio out of Gallatin, Tennessee [sic. Nashville, Tennessee].  That's over by (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were WDIA [WDIA Radio, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: WDIA, yeah.  You all had that in Memphis, right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, WDIA, which Rufus Thomas--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that group were on.
Speaker 1: Late at night, we would get that other station from Gallatin (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And there's another black station in Memphis.  It was WDIA, and W--I don't remember the other one.  And then in Nashville [Tennessee], you know, when I went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] there was a black station there, probably--that may have been the one you heard, you know, the Galveston [sic.].  I don't know.
Speaker 1: There was one in Gallatin, Tennessee.  Late at night they would come on--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: --with the Hossman [Bill "Hoss" Allen] and all that sort of thing.  They'd play like a lot of Otis Redding.  And they had blues, and they'd play gospel songs, too, out of Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, DIA.  And I don't remember the other one.  And then the one in Nashville I listened to a lot.
Story_ID: 638247
Speaker 1: So by the time you were a teenager, things had, were really starting to change, in terms of the social Memphis [Tennessee], you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Things had changed, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, tell us about, like what was--?
Speaker 2: Well now, at one point while I was a teenager, I can remember going to The Malco theater [Orpheum Theatre, Memphis, Tennessee], still having to sit upstairs.  Now that, I do remember.  You could only go to the movies on certain days, you know.  And then sometimes you had to sit upstairs if you went to the movies.  You know, and there were still--and I don't know that I was an older teenager.  I may have been like eleven.  No, no, because my mother [Lorene White McCollins] wouldn't have let me go.  I was thirteen or fourteen, because I can remember my mother dropping me off at the theater.  And you--there were restricted areas and/or restricted days that we could go.  Let's just say blacks could go on Tuesdays and Saturday mornings or something, I don't remember.  But I do remember the restriction- you know, those relegated times that we could go to the movies.
Speaker 1: And that was still going on when you were in high school [Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure if it was high school or junior high.  Now, by the time I went to high school, I don't remember the movies as much as I remember the restaurants.  We were able to go to eat in Shoney's [Memphis, Tennessee] and other places that we had not been able to do, as we, you know, in junior high school.  So, I do remember those barriers being broken.  I finished high school in '66 [1966].  So, things were pretty good by then in Memphis in terms of restrooms and in terms of--you know, you encountered some individual sexis- I mean racism.  You know, some salespersons in the stores were not so nice.  And you know, people reacted a little bit, but basically things had changed.
Speaker 1: Was Crump [E.H. Crump] the mayor then?  Or, was it Crump?
Speaker 2: Loeb [Henry Loeb].
Speaker 1: Loeb, Loeb, Loeb, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And he had the barbeque place.
Speaker 2: He had the barbeque place and a bunch of children.  I remember he'd have his kids in the paper all the time.
Speaker 1: Right, right, yeah, right, right.
Speaker 2: He had twelve kids or something.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He had a combination barbeque and laundromat.  I mean I noticed those in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Loeb's cleaners [Loeb's Laundry].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I know Loeb's laundromat, I mean, Loeb's Barbeque [Memphis, Tennessee].  Now I don't remember--and I guess--was he the mayor?
Speaker 1: I believe he was.
Speaker 2: I think Loeb was the mayor at one time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he was.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I was there in '68 [1968] right after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 638248
Speaker 1: Now you were out of high school [Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed.
Speaker 2: Well, I was at Fisk.
Speaker 1: You were at Fisk.
Speaker 2: I went to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On April 4, 1968.  I remember we were, we were at--a friend of ours had gotten her boyfriend's car, or her brother's car, and we were driving around listening to the cassette tapes then.  And when we got to campus, we saw the campus was deserted.  And I remember the dean of students running across campus telling us, "Get in, get in."  You know, they just, Dr. King had just been assassinated.  So, I remember it was just hysteria.  And we had to run to our dorms, because the riots, there were riots in Nashville [Tennessee] that night.  And I can remember just the anger.  And the girls, you know, they made stay in the dorm.  The boys somehow got out.  And I remember hanging out of a window throwing Coke bottles [Coca-Cola] down to the boys so they could go take them.  And they were throwing bottles into the--I don't know if I should be telling this.  They were throwing bottles into the car windows of people.  You know, just the rage, the anger, that was felt.  And the girls couldn't do anything.  The only thing we knew to do was to give them ammunition.  So, in the girls dorm--and then I remember the National Guard walking across our campus and surrounding our dorms trying to keep us calm.
Speaker 1: Now, what did Martin Luther King mean to you?
Speaker 2: Well, for us, Dr. King was the engineer of the Civil Rights Movement.  He was our voice, he was our hero, he was our Moses.  So, the idea that someone would assassinate him produced, evoked a kind of rage that--it was even hard--it was hard to contain, it was hard to express.  The tears, the anger--you know, it was a mess in there, in that dorm, you know.  People were just angry, but we couldn't strike out at each other.  They were hitting walls and breaking bottles, you know, just--it was awful.
Story_ID: 638249
Speaker 1: Let me take you, go back to school.  What was your favorite subject in school [Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee]? In, in--
Speaker 2: English.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And now, did you write for the school paper, or did you do any of that sort of thing when you were in school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no.  I don't even remember if we had school papers then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you, I mean did you run for class office or anything?  Or--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't even remember that I did or didn't.  I'm not sure that they had--I guess not.
Speaker 1: Well, what activities?  Were you involved in any high school activities?
Speaker 2: I was involved, I was--remember the NDCC?  It was the National Defense Cadet Corps, which was the black version of the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  I was in that.  I was in a lot of clubs, social clubs, like the debs [debutants] and the--you know, we started social clubs, and we were in some citywide clubs where girls from, you know, girls from certain--from every school were allowed to be a part, the co-eds.  So I was very involved, always doing something, and very involved in my church [St. Jude Missionary Baptist Church, Memphis, Tennessee].  Now, I don't--if I ran for office-- and I may have, I don't know.  I'm not sure if we were doing--I guess we had senior class presidents.  Yeah, we did, we did.  Because I dated the senior class president one time, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well--
Speaker 2: Proms, you know, we went to proms and cotillions and--black social life was certainly exciting in Memphis [Tennessee] for me.
Story_ID: 638250
Speaker 1: When you graduated, you knew you were gonna probably to teach, and come back to Memphis [Tennessee] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I felt that that's what I would do.  I wanted to go away.  I was determined that I was not going to LeMoyne [LeMoyne College; LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee].  I was an only child; I needed to get out.  So, I applied to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I got a four year scholarship to Spelman, but they had no dorm space.  So I ended up going to Fisk where they had plenty of dorm space, but no money, (laughter) but that was fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated from Hamilton [Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee] in 1966 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixty-Six [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And went to Fisk, and graduated from Fisk in 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, well, how did you like Fisk?
Speaker 2: Loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm going back to my fortieth reunion next--today--I mean tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who were some of the personalities on campus--teachers, students, that you remember?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I remember [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was kind of easing out by the time I was there.  The--I'm trying to think of who might be a little bit--well, this guy Greg Spence [ph.] who I think--do you know Greg Spence?  Have you heard of him?  He was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I heard the name, but I'm not sure--
Speaker 2: He's done a lot of good things.  [HistoryMaker] Ramona Edelin?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Remember her?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But she was Ramona Hoage, I remember her.  The--I'm trying to think of some of the others that had some national acclaim that were with me, you know.  But Lucius Outlaw?
Speaker 1: I've heard that name, too.
Speaker 2: You've heard of Lucius Outlaw?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: They were older than I am, so they may not remember me.  But they were the bigwigs on campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: But I loved Fisk, I loved it, a great place to be.  Fun, decent academics, I think.
Speaker 1: Well, what about the teachers at Fisk?  Any--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Fisk was the first place I ever had a white teacher.  But they were pretty committed.  You know, the teachers that I remember that had the most impact on me were Dr. Rosentene Bennett Purnell, who was the cousin, she was in the family of [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett.  What's his name?  Marcellus Brooks, who was my Spanish teacher.  And of course, Dr. Gladys Ford, who was the speech and drama teacher, I remember her.  She was quite a lady and quite--you know, she was one, if you were late for a class, she locked you out.  Just a great lady, though, you know.
Speaker 1: What kind of--now, you were an English major.  What kind of works were you reading?  What were you, you know, what was your--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was reading--it was at Fisk that I was first introduced to, not only black writers like--I'm having a mental block.
Speaker 1: In those days, James Baldwin (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'The Outsider' [Richard Wright], Baldwin, right.
Speaker 1: --was very popular.
Speaker 2: 'The Outsider,' and Ellison [Ralph Ellison].  But also, I, you know, was introduced to folks like Chinua Achebe, African literature.  So, that was good for me.  Of course, reading Shakespeare [William Shakespeare], I had to do Shakespeare.  And Dr. Purnell loved Chaucer [Geoffrey Chaucer] and all those guys.  So, I just had a--you know, being an English major, I was introduced to the gambit of writing.  And then I went on to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], of course, and continued in that vein in the reading.
Story_ID: 638251
Speaker 1: I assume you made pretty good grades at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And--
Speaker 2: I made decent grades--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in most things except math (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  So, did you get a scholarship to Boston U?  Did you--how did--?
Speaker 2: Did I get a scholarship to Boston U?  No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because, you know what?  Well, I--no, I didn't get a scholarship.  I just wanted to go to Boston [Massachusetts].  So I was determined not to go to Memphis [Tennessee], back home.  So I applied to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had pretty good grades to get Boston U in English.  That's pretty good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, I had good enough grades.  But I, I applied at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], NYU [New York University, New York, New York], and Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  And I told the Lord the first one that comes through, that's where I'm going, and I came to Boston.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So how did you like Boston University?  Now this is the first time you lived a dorm, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a different world, a different world.
Speaker 1: Well, what are some of the details?
Speaker 2: Oh, god.  Well, I was--the thing that got--well, I loved Boston.  You know, it's certainly the intellectual mecca; Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts].  But the thing that baffled me most about Boston was South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts] and East Boston [Boston, Massachusetts].  That was where you didn't go at night, because if black folks were caught in East Boston at night, you could get, you would get jumped.  So, there was still--and that amazed me, because it wasn't as bad in Memphis as it was in Boston.  Racism was far more prevalent and far more visible in Boston than even in Memphis and Nashville [Tennessee].  That was very surprising to me.  You know, you had Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] where you could go, but right next to Roxbury was East Boston.  And then there was a South Boston.  I think one was Irish and one was Italian, and you just didn't go there.  I mean you kind of, you could go in the day, but for God's sake, don't go at night.
Speaker 1: Now, South Boston, during those days they had the famous school crisis in South Boston--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the bussing crisis (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See, I was there in '70 [1970] and '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  That was the beginning of that crisis.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts], and--
Speaker 2: Dorchester was okay, yeah.  And you could so easily take the wrong turn.  And that's what I just remember.  I remember coming from parties in Boston, in Dorchester or Roxbury, and if you took the wrong turn, before you knew it, you would be in East Boston, and you would be--and there were no cell phones in that day.  And you were scared to get out to call.  You were scared, you were afraid to ask anybody directions, because--and I remember being over there one night by myself coming from a, coming from an event; I don't remember what it was.  And I literally feared for my life.  And you just never thought about that, you know, going to Boston.  So, Boston to me was one of the most--not only diverse, but you had two extremes, more than any other city I had ever encountered.  Because there was no place in Memphis by that time that I would just be scared to death to go to (laughter).
Speaker 1: And ha- had you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or Nashville, you know, we went all over in Nashville.
Story_ID: 638252
Speaker 1: I know every, every, everybody who's black's grandmother or auntie's got a poster on the wall with John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], you know.
Speaker 2: And Jesus.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And the idea is that the Kennedys are from Massachusetts.  And--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's liberal, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Which, you know, we didn't talk about--in the tenth grade was when JFK got assassinated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember that vividly, you know.  It's like, what were you doing when Kennedy got shot?  And what were you doing when King and--what were you doing when 9/11 [September 11, 2001] hit?  So, it's like I remember vividly the word coming to us in high school [Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee] that Kennedy had been shot.  And I remember we were--the only thing we had were transistor radios.  And I remember on the school yard where the group with the transistor radio was standing.  And I remember the screams coming forth when they announced that Kennedy had died.  And that was a horrible day too for us.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, why did black southern teenagers care so much about John F. Kennedy?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we were just--our parents voted for Kennedy, and he became our symbol of--at least we saw him as pro black, and Nixon as anti-black.  So we were very happy when Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] was defeated, and very invested, very invested in John F. Kennedy.  You know, I'm not sure that we knew the politics, but he just represented--you know, this is the man our fathers and mothers voted for.  And this is who we loved.
Story_ID: 638253
Speaker 1: I was saying on the day that John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was shot, I remember my principal [at Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee] coming over the loudspeaker stating that, "President John F. Kennedy has just been shot."  And oh, the screams and the tears.  And I even remember one of my friends was so despondent, she was like trying to jump out of a window.  And we were saying, "Girl," you know, we were trying to pull her back.  But she was devastated; she was devastated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think he represented a hope for--
Speaker 1: I guess--
Speaker 2: --a brighter future for a lot of people.
Speaker 1: But interestingly, my [maternal] grandmother [Addie Manuel White] was very--she, she was grieving for Kennedy.  But my youngest uncle was in the [U.S.] Army.  And she just, she was like hysterical, because she thought that the death of John F. Kennedy was going to somehow set off a reaction whereby my uncle, her youngest son, would be stuck in Germany or--you know, she feared for his life.  So that was, you know, once we got to her house and heard her political spin on it, we even became, became even more despondent.  And I remember sitting in my grandmother's house watching the funeral of JFK.
Speaker 2: What did your people think about, you know, what happened to him?  Did they have a theory about what it was?  What did people say?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, what, what I remember, the good die young, and anybody who wants to help black folks, you know, they kill them.  And the thing that I remember, my father [Leroy McCollins], my father then worked in Mobile, Alabama.  Because Mallory Air Force base [Mallory Air Force Depot, Memphis, Tennessee] closed, and they gave him an option of moving to Wright Patmus [sic. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio] or Brookley Air Force Base in Mobile.  And he chose Mobile.  And he, he would come home every weekend.  But he talked about the white folks dancing in the street the night that John F. Kennedy died.  Now, I couldn't even comprehend that.  But he said down there where he lived (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, in Mobile?
Speaker 1: In Mobile, Alabama.  They were dancing in the street.  Now, that could have happened in Memphis [Tennessee] too.  It could have happened in many places.  But he happened to have seen that, and he was devastated himself.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, I heard a lot of people say that too, that anytime somebody tried to help black folks, they'd kill them.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That was a common reaction.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was what, that was what I heard.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So anyway, at Boston U, here you are expecting to be in the most liberal state in the union.  And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it was unbelievable.  I mean, and even when you think about the football--the baseball team up there then.  You know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Boston Red Sox.
Speaker 2: The Boston Red Sox was--you didn't have many blacks on there.  Even the Boston Celtics, if you think about it, just one, you know.  So, it was like, okay, this is really something, you know.  How can it be so dichotomous?  You know, liberal, Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], accepting--you know, acceptance in some areas.  Not just acceptance, but you know, being embraced in many areas, but then scared for your life in other areas.  So, that was an interesting experience for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did your studies--well, you got your degree, and you--
Speaker 2: Got my master's degree.
Speaker 1: Were there any outstanding professors there or individuals at Boston that helped you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, my Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] experience, let me just say this.  I was so intimidated at Boston University.  Now, think about it.  I went to Hamilton High School [Memphis, Tennessee], all-black.  Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], all-black, a few white teachers.  But to get into a classroom with white students, that was the first time.  So, I had to overcome my own feelings of inferiority and insecurity.  My first semester--you know, at least the first semester, it was just, it was a program that was only one year.  It was a year and a summer for me, because I, I just, I just was intimidated.  Finally, I figured it out, that I had as much smarts.  But I was intimidated.  So, it, it, was interesting to me.  And I'm glad that, you know, for my own children, they were able to go to--well, they went to Allen Christian School [Queens, New York], which is all-black.  But then for high school, they were able to go to an integrated high school, which I think probably helped them to become a little bit more secure and confident than I was going into college, goin- especially going into graduate school.
Story_ID: 638255
Speaker 1: What did you do when you graduated from Boston U [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I graduated, I got a job.  I was determined not to go back to Memphis [Tennessee].  So I got a job in the Newton district [Newtown Public Schools], Newton, Massachusetts, teaching English to seventh and eighth graders.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, how did that work out?
Speaker 2: It was fine.  It was an all-white school.  I was the only black teacher, and there were no black students, maybe one or two.
Speaker 1: So this is '72 [1972], '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972] to '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, '72 [1972] to '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, now, I don't want to jump too far ahead.  But when did you get your degree from United [United Theological Seminary, Dayton, Ohio]?  Was that--?
Speaker 2: Oh, that--well, see, well, okay.  I got married in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We moved to New York [New York].  And I didn't go to United--well, first I went to Union, Union Theological Seminary [New York, New York].  I finished in 1993.  I went right into United from Union.  I think I finished there in '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, well, tell us how you met Reverend Floyd Flake [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake].
Speaker 2: In church (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I, when I went to Boston [Massachusetts], you know, I had some churchless years at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]; I didn't go to church.  Not because I had anything against church, it was just because I didn't have a car, and there were no, you know, there was no transportation.  So, I just didn't go to church until I went back home.  But when I went to Boston, I got a car and I set out to find a church.  And (gesture) the church in Boston at that time was St. Paul A.M.E. Church in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  So I joined St. Paul and I met Floyd there in about 19--we got married in '75 [1975], so I guess I met him around '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you all met in church and had similar interests?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.  It was a great church, St. Paul Church.  Ron McNair [Ronald McNair] was there.  He was getting his degree from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  The great thing that I remember about Ron McNair was that he taught karate every day to the neighborhood boys in Cambridge.  He was a great guy.  And my roommate [Cheryl Moore McNair] married Ron McNair.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: My--the girl that, she and I lived together my first year there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm trying to think--I think Congressman Jefferson went to St. Paul.  It was, I mean that church was--I mean--
Speaker 1: Oh, Congressman Jefferson from Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, [HistoryMaker] William Jefferson.
Speaker 2: William Jefferson, I think he was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And quite a few preachers out there today.
Story_ID: 638256
Speaker 1: Let's see.  You got married.  And did you stay in the Boston [Massachusetts] area after?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.  I mean, we married in December and we came to New York [New York] in September.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: My husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake] told me he was never going to pastor, that he was going to stay in academia.  But then the bishop made him an offer and he took it.  And we came to New York.
Speaker 1: So, he intended to teach in a theological seminary?
Speaker 2: He wanted to be--no, he wanted to be the president of a black college [HBCU].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That was his goal in life.  He was at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] at that time as the dean of student--I mean dean of the chapel, and then he became dean of students.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you are at Greater Allen in New York [Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And now this, of course, the church was named for Richard Allen.
Speaker 2: Richard Allen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the, what do they call it--the four horsemen of the Episcopal- of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church?  I think they called it that at one time. Allen, Paul Quinn [William Paul Quinn] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he was the founder.
Speaker 1: The founder, yeah.
Speaker 2: You got McNeal Turner [Henry McNeal Turner], who was the--
Speaker 1: I think--yeah, Paul Quinn.
Speaker 2: Payne [Daniel Alexander Payne] and Quinn.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right, exactly.  That's--yeah, okay.  That's big history there (laughter).   We have to put it out.  So, so, you became a, you became an A.M.E.
Speaker 2: I became an A.M.E. in Boston.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Much to my mother's [Lorene White McCollins] chagrin.  And then I married Floyd, and so I was, it looked like I was going to be stuck with African Methodism for a while, which I have been.  But it's okay.
Speaker 1: Now, what is the difference?  There's often said that the A.M.E. are more staid than the Baptist and that sort of thing.  But there is really a big difference (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think, you know, from a traditional perspective that that's the thinking, that A.M.E.s were more of the (gesture) educated, more sophisticated.  And I chuckle, because as you look at some of our national organizations like the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] and The Links [The Links, Incorporated], and perhaps even--well, I'm not sure about the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.], but I know the AKAs--I'm an AKA.  But I look at our past basili, and like, it's like--of the ones still living, about five of them are A.M.E.s.  So it's like the A.M.E. church--and even with The Links.  So it's like the A.M.E. church was the, you know--
Speaker 1: The crucible for the leadership of the--
Speaker 2: Seemingly, I think so.  But, but, as I think about it, you know, St. Paul [St. Paul A.M.E. Church, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was a very non-traditional A.M.E. church, in that it was very lively; music, drums, the whole nine yards.  And that's kind of the model we brought to Allen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But on the other hand, clearly there are a more black Baptists than any other--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the largest black organization in the world is still the--
Speaker 2: The National Baptist?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.].
Speaker 2: I would think so.
Speaker 1: A huge organization.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And now there're two of them, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: They're still the big- you know.
Story_ID: 638257
Speaker 1: Okay, so in '70 [1970]--so you've been here since 1976?
Speaker 2: We came here in September of '76 [1976].  I was newly married.  We had a baby eleven months after our marriage.  One of the things that I said to my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake] in coming here, you know, coming to New York [New York]--I really wanted--the first thing we wanted, I wanted the school.  So, I wanted to be able to--well, there had been a school started at the church in Boston [Massachusetts], Henry Buckner [Henry Buckner School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And so I, you know--and I know that that was, that was something that was doable.  And so, we kind of started talking about that right away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were interested in that.
Speaker 1: And this is, this--this becomes the Richard Allen School?  Or--?
Speaker 2: No, it's called Allen Christian School [Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Allen Christian School?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, Allen Christian School.
Speaker 2: Founded in 1983.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now what, now, you were the wife of a pastor?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you decide to become a reverend yourself?
Speaker 2: That was much later.
Speaker 1: That was much later?
Speaker 2: Much later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So at this time you're building up--
Speaker 2: I was the first lady.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're the first lady.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you still teaching at that time?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, see, once I came here, I had three babies in, between '76 [1976] and '80 [1980], three children.  And it was around '80 [1980] that we really said that we were, you know, we were getting serious about the school.  So, my husband asked me to do the footwork, in terms of seeing what needed to be done to actually bring the school into fruition.  And let me just back up and say that we had purchased the corner that the school now stands on, and we had begun to raise money.  Now, by this time, I was head of the women's ministry, heading up the women's ministry in the fundraising portion of the women's ministry.  So, I was really actively involved in the fundraising and doing what we needed to do to build the school.  I had no idea when we talked about starting the school that he was going to want to build the school.  But I thought we would have it in the basement of the church [Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York] or whatever, but that became his dream, our dream and vision.  And so, I began around '82 [1982] to do the legwork for the school, you know, contacting the state, you know, with what did I need to do?  And I visited Concord Baptist [Concord Baptist Elementary School, Brooklyn, New York], Laura Young--I mean not Laura Young--Laura Taylor [Laura Scott Taylor], Gardner Taylor's [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor] wife.  I visited her school.
Speaker 1: Right, and--
Speaker 2: I visited--
Speaker 1: --I remember Gardner Taylor, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I visited other schools around, and decided the kind of school that I felt we needed to have.  I, you know, pulled together the curriculum, the textbooks and the like.  I did the application, the hiring of the initial teachers, hiring of the--and then my husband pulled together from within the church a board, you know, to kind of help with the starting of the school.  So it was--when I look back, it was kind of--it wasn't that hard.  It's just something you just had to do and stick with it.  So I had the first teachers and the first principal, and we opened in September with--we, I put the applications out and started interviewing.  We were praying for seventy-five.  We opened with 232 students.  And that was just pre-K [kindergarten] through second--through third grade.  It was amazing.  It was utterly amazing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 638258
Speaker 1: So, when you came up with this idea, was it because--I mean did you have a critique of the public school system that--?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm going to be honest with you.  I did, I did have a critique of the public school system.  But I also wanted a solid, private school for my own children as well as the children of my church [Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York] and my community.  You know, I think from a historical perspective, you know, I think black folks educate black folks well, you know.  And I'm certainly not a segregationist, but I, I just felt that for this community, this school [Allen Christian School, Queens, New York] was what was needed.  And obviously, I think I've been right, because we have always had a good number.  And we're in our twenty--we started in '83 [1983].  We're in our twenty-seventh year.
Speaker 1: Does your school outperform the public schools academically?
Speaker 2: I think, yeah, it does, from a test score perspective.  We, because we are private and we don't get any funding, we have to really fight and work hard to get a lot of the amenities, you know, a lot of the extra--you know, like the computers and the SMART boards.  But, you know, I call forth the fundraising entities to kind of keep us abreast of what we--but it's a safe environment, it's a great environment, a Christian environment--the kids singing.  I have devotions every day.  So, and we, and we really fight to maintain not only a strong academic standing, but to keep the spiritual aspect of the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was the spiritual aspect as important as the academic aspect?
Speaker 2: Very important to me.  I, I think one of the worst things that ever happened was to take prayer out of the school.  Not that I believe everybody has to be Christian, but I think religion has its place.  And with the deterioration of the school system, I feel in terms of behavior, in terms of all of the things that--I just think it would be different, and that was my thinking.  And that's why I thought a Christian school, a Christian environment, was so important.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, the school now has, it started in 1980 [sic].  So you're over--
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 1: --thirty years?  Almost (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is our twenty-fifth graduating class--
Speaker 1: Twenty-fifth, okay.
Speaker 2: --that will graduate in March.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I mean--I'm sorry, in June.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, the twenty-fifth graduating class.  Because the next year, we added, we started up to the third grade.  The next year we added fourth, fifth, and sixth.  And so after that, we, the sixth grade became the seventh, and the seventh grade became the eighth.  So it was, it was three years, two or three years before we had a graduating class.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did you play an official function? I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Not only did I kind of, you know, start the school.  But I decided that because my children were small, I really did not need to be the director.  So I, they gave me the title of educational director.  So I really did shape the curriculum, you know, order the testing materials.  But there was another principal, her name was Herbie Madison [ph.], who had retired from the public school system, and she gave us a few years. I think five years--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --she did the, she did the principalship.  And I, I just stayed on as educational director, and stayed in that role until I came over to the church full-time.
Story_ID: 638259
Speaker 1: So, I don't want to miss any--let's see.  So, my notes are kind of sketchy in the middle here, between I guess the time the school [Allen Christian School, Queens, New York] started and the time that you went to theological school [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York].  And--
Speaker 2: Well, in--you know, after we did the school, let me just say we started the Allen Women's Resource Center [Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which also was a dream of mine through the missionaries.  I just, you know, spousal abuse was at--you know, you just hear these horrible cases.  And so, I wanted to do something for the women, you know.  I was really big in women's ministry.  I started having retreats and conferences, and I decided that that was something that the church [Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York] should be a part of, this--to provide a shelter.  I had someone do the proposal.  I did not think they were going to give us the proposal right away.  But, you know, well, not give us the proposal--give us the project.  I thought you'd have to submit a proposal--two or three years.  But the first--they said, "You--okay, you all got the funding."  I said, "Oh, my god."
Story_ID: 638260
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, this period of time, I think--and correct me if I'm wrong.  But I think it represents a period of struggle for black women in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, and probably other denominations too.  But I know in the A.M.E., with, with--before we started I told you that I interviewed Carolyn Tyler Guidry [HistoryMaker Bishop Carolyn Tyler Guidry] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Guidry?
Speaker 2: Vashti McKenzie [HistoryMaker Bishop Vashti McKenzie] and Jamye--
Speaker 1: And, you know--right.
Speaker 2: And Dr. Jamye Coleman [HistoryMaker Jamye Coleman Williams].
Speaker 1: Jamye Coleman Williams.  And I'll tell you, Jackie Grant [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Jacquelyn Grant].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jackie Grant.
Speaker 1: Jackie Grant was on our staff.  She, she was on our ministerial staff [at Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York].  She was at Union [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] at the time.  Now I'm going to be honest with you.  See, between '76 [1976] and '83 [1983], '84 [1984], '83 [1983], I was being the first lady there.  I was in the first lady thing.  I didn't start moving towards ministry until '83 [1983], '84 [1984], and I became more aware.  I knew Vashti, because Vashti and I were fr-, we met through John Bryant [John Richard Bryant].  Because my pastor in Boston [Massachusetts] was now serving in Baltimore [Maryland], and Vashti was a member of his church, and our churches would come together.  So, that's when I met Vashti.  Vashti was going into ministry then.  I was not thinking about ministry.  But I can be honest and say that as hard as the struggle may have been for women in the A.M.E. church, it was 100 percent better than it was for women in the Baptist and the Church of God in Christ.  Now, people, I think what they would say--and I would have to bear this out--they would say that women were treated unfairly.  They would, they would say that women were given the churches that the brothers wouldn't go to; they were given the worst of the worst.  I can remember Vashti pastored some circuit church.  I remember her stories about that.  But in all honesty, I don't think their horror stories come close to the horror stories of women in the Baptist church.
Speaker 2: For instance, what?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, preaching from the floor.  You know, I, you know, I can't be sure, but I know in most A.M.E. churches--because by this time, I was (gesture) speaking.  I wasn't preaching, but I was being invited to do Women's Day, and Missionary Day, always given the pulpit.  And I was not even an ordained preacher.
Speaker 2: Okay, this what we mean then by the floor?  That they--
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: You say that the Baptist women were not allowed to go--
Speaker 1: Were not allowed in the pulpit.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were only speakers.  They were never Reverend anybody.  You know, that was, that was far and in between.  So, for, for people like Vashti and Carolyn Guidry Tyler [sic.]--and there was one woman, Mary Watson Stewart, who was a much older woman.  Well, Mary Watson Stewart, and Nurjhan Govan, these were the first women preachers I saw, Mary Watson Stewart and Nurjhan Govan.  They were always Reverend.  They were always preaching in the pulpit.  They were always--
Speaker 2: How do you spell Nurjhan Govan?
Speaker 1: Oh, Lord.  Nurjhan, I think her name is N-U-R--I would have to write it.  I think it's N-U-R, maybe J-A-N.  There's an H in there.  And Govan is G-O-V-O-N--V-A-N, Govan.
Speaker 2: Govan, okay, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 638261
Speaker 1: She [Nurjhan Govan] was the first female preacher I saw.  And I might say, I was, I was like, "Oh, my god."  I was awe filled.   And I cried for a week, because I had never seen a woman preach.  I had never seen a woman called Reverend.  And that just, that floored me.  And so, so these women--while I'm sure they have some bad stories, they, you know, they still--I think the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church is the trendsetter.  It's certainly there in the forefront when it comes to women, as bad as women may have been treated.  And you read the history of a Jarena Lee, who was told that she, that God didn't call women.  But yet, she was given the platform to preach.  She, she, she preached.  She was an evangelist.  So, women, I think they fought--I think women in the A.M.E. church fought.  The A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion] church fought hard, and were, and by the time my generation came, though it wasn't perfect--because sexism is still alive and well in my denomination, obviously.  But I think the A.M.E. church has always been a few steps ahead.  I would have to say that the A.M.E. church--and A.M.E. Zion even--I don't know the history of the A.M.E. Zion and C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] like I know A.M.E.
Speaker 2: A.M.E. Zion is almost the same age.  They started--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know I started, but I mean--
Speaker 2: --about four years later.
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean, I don't know their history as it relates to women (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, in terms of the dynamics.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I'm not sure either what the ministry--you know.
Speaker 1: But by the time I went into ministry, which would be '93 [1993]--because it took me a long time to finish seminary.  Because I got, I started and then I had my fourth son, and then I waited a couple of years and I went back.  And it just took, I had to take my time, because I was working full time, mothering full time, doing the work around the church [Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York] full time, and trying to do a class here and a class there.  So, I suspect my time at Union [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] was '83 [1983] to '93 [1993].
Speaker 2: Now, did the male clergy on a whole try to discourage women from--
Speaker 1: I had a--
Speaker 2: In the A.M.E. church?
Speaker 1: Women?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from becoming ministers.  Or--
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.
Speaker 2: I know it hadn't been done in the past.  But--
Speaker 1: Now, the real, the real discouragement came from those of us who were married to preachers.  Now, that's what I found.  I think men in the A.M.E. church pretty much accepted woman clergy.  But see, I was coming in at a time when a lot of women who were married to preachers were now beginning to move towards ministry.  Now, that's where I heard people say--you know, I had people to say--the male pastors and bishops say to me, "You don't need to be doing that.  Floyd [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake] don't need--," you know, they would say, "Floyd doesn't need you trying to preach.  There can't be but one," you know, just crazy stuff.  I mean people would even say, you know, "Ugly women go into ministry."  I had pastors say that to me.  But, so, that was the--
Speaker 2: You weren't ugly enough to go in, to be a--
Speaker 1: Right, you know.  That was kind of what they were saying.  But, and that was interesting to me.  That was--and still--now this clergy couple thing seems to be the new paradigm.  But understand, in the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s], it wasn't.  And my husband was very supportive.  But some of the flack that I got from other men was interesting to me.
Story_ID: 638262
Speaker 1: So, this is kind of a time period of struggle?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But some gains in terms of that struggle, too, for women to be part of the church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I mean, I, I think that I realized that while women are accepted in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, and they are affirmed to a certain degree in the A.M.E. church, I think our bishops are very conscientious about trying to be fair.  You know, if there are four preaching opportunities, at least one of them has to be a woman.  You know, I think they're very conscious of that, and I do applaud them for that.  But I also feel that, you know, the leadership of the denomination is still predominantly male in a denomination that's predominantly female.  So, and I would, I was right there in the thick of the fight for Vashti [HistoryMaker Bishop Vashti McKenzie].  Because I just felt that it would be an abomination for us to come into the turn of the century and not elect a female.  And Vashti was, well, she had the national recognition.  She had the, she had performed well in her local church [Payne Memorial A.M.E. Church, Baltimore, Maryland].  She was a great preacher, and I just thought that she was as qualified as anybody else running.  So, I was very, very, very--I didn't have a vote.  But whatever little influence I had--and I had a few friends who were, who were delegates--I did what I could.  I was determined that we needed to go into the year 2000, or come out of the general conference in 2000 with a female bishop.
Story_ID: 638263
Speaker 1: I did not ask you, what was the nature of your call to the ministry (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My call?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think, to be honest with you--now, I've always loved church.  I'd never seen a female preacher.  And remember I said when I heard the Reverend Nurjhan Govan preach at the St. Paul A.M.E. Church in Cambridge [Massachusetts], I cried for a week.  I just couldn't stop crying.  So my pastor then, John Bryant [John Richard Bryant], said to me, "Are you okay?"  He said, "Are you sure you're not being called to preach?"  And of course that was a foreign concept to me, because I never knew that women--and I can't say that that was the call.  But I think that may have opened the door, or that may have been the beginning of it.  Then when we came--and I've always been involved in church, always loved church.  So, I worked very hard at the church there in Cambridge.  Then when I married Floyd [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake] and we came here [Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York], it was just kind of a natural fit.  I just do church; I just love church.  And so I took the missionary society, I took the women's department.  And then people began to ask me to speak, ask me to come and speak for Women's Day, and to speak for different occasions in the church.  And so then I was out there doing it.  And then finally somebody said, "Well, you may as well make it official."  In fact, I think it was my former pastor who said, "You know, you're jack legging.  You may as well make it official."  So I cried and prayed, and I went to see Dr. Jim Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.] down at Union Seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York], because I needed a voice that was not--you know, kind of a detached voice--not my husband, not people who knew me well.  And I had met Dr. Forbes and I asked for an appointment, and he listened to me.  And he said, "I just think you just are hard to convince.  But I think that, you know, God is really calling you."  And he encouraged me to go to the seminary.  And that's kind of how it happened.  It was kind of a--you know, I was not knocked off my donkey on the Damascus Road.  It was just kind of an evolution into ministry.  I've always done ministry in terms of working and fundraising and missions, outreach.  But all of a sudden, people were just asking me.  I was getting all these invitations to come and preach, to speak, not preach.  And so I just kind of went into it that way, very cautiously, asking for signs all along the way.
Story_ID: 638264
Speaker 1: Now, I think your, your first divinity degree was acquired through United (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Union. Union.
Speaker 1: Union Theological Seminary, okay.
Speaker 2: Here in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, New York City.
Speaker 2: So I was, I sat with Dr. Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.], Jim Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone], Jim Washington [James Washington], Delores Williams [Wilma Delores Webb Williams].  It was a great experience, probably the greatest academic experience of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you, I know you attended United Theological Seminary [Dayton, Ohio].
Speaker 2: As soon as I came out of--well, as I was coming out of Union, my husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake] was going into United for the doctoral program.  And he was saying, "You know, I really think you'd like it."  And I said, "No, I cannot--once I come of school--." Because you've got to remember, my seminary--I still had four kids in elementary school and well into high school.  So I was writing papers, and doing science projects, and doing work here at the church [Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York], and doing spelling tests, and studying for Old Testament, while my son had to do, you know, a paper.  And so, I just needed to rest.  And--but then I said to my husband, "The only way I will go to United is if they get me two (gesture) academics."  And as I was coming out of United, they were starting a new program in--as I was coming out of Union, they were starting a new program at United with Drs. Clarice Martin and Jim Myers--I mean Bill Myers [William R. "Bill" Myers].  And so, I went right into that program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And so United was three years.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you--was there anything surprising that you learned in the seminary that you did not know?
Speaker 2: In seminary?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that you did not--what was the most dramatic thing you learned?
Speaker 2: The first thing I learned is everybody in the seminary didn't believe in God.  That was the most surprising thing.  You know, I expected the seminary to be an extension of Sunday school or something, you know.  So when I got there and just listened to the rhetoric and listened to the anti-biblical teaching sometimes, and the anti-Christian paradigms, and--I was amazed.  And some people had warned me.  Obviously, I knew a lot of seminarians, but you know, seeing it--being told about it and then experiencing it are two different things.  So, that was just like the most earth shattering thing for me.  But, you know, you muddle through it, and you get what you need from it.  And what do they say?  You throw out the, you chew the meat and throw out the bones.  But I enjoyed the seminary, because it certainly took me on an intellectual, stimulating journey.  Being able to study under James Cone and Jim Forbes was certainly a blessing for me.  And Jim Washington.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, now how did the seminary experience influence what you instituted here at church, you know?
Speaker 2: To be honest with you, the seminary influences most--well, two things--your social involvement and your preaching.  They don't--in the seminary, they do not teach you how to be pastors, not in any seminary that I went to.  But you do learn the importance of social gospel, social ministry, you know; that is emphasized.  And you're always aware of your context.  That is one thing I think the seminary does, it helps you to be aware--well, it reminds you of the importance of being aware of your context; you know, the less fortunate, the marginalized, the--I mean not that you wouldn't do that anyway.  But, you know, seminaries certainly reinforces that.  But the seminary is an interesting place, because I don't think it--I don't know what the curriculum is like now, but it doesn't really prepare you to pastor.  It prepares you to preach and to do some aspects of ministry.  But the little kinks and the nuts and bolts of running a church, you don't get in the seminary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Now, are you referring to the business aspect of it?  Or the psychological, or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The business aspect, dealing with people and systems and structures, and what works and what does not work, and how you should set up the infrastructure of your church; the leadership, the tiers.  You know, you get that from your denomination, or maybe from friends, you know.  That's why having friends in ministry is so important, because you learn how to pastor listening to other people.  You know, my friends and I, I have a group of women.  We go away every January, and we just literally sit up and talk about what we're doing, and how we can do this better, and, "What are you doing?"  "Okay, I think I'll try that."  Because that's, that's how you learn to pastor, and how you learn to program, and how you learn to do ministry, because that's not really taught.  I mean counseling is taught.  You know, you learn to counsel and you learn to do other things like that.  But just in terms of creating an innovative and attractive ministry, you don't get that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You don't get that.
Story_ID: 638265
Speaker 1: What are some of the initiatives that you and your husband [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake] have tried to institute here at Greater Allen [Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, in addition to the school [Allen Christian School, Queens, New York], in addition to the Women's Resource Center [Allen Women's Resource Center, Queens, New York], and in addition to the prison ministry--we have a very viable prison ministry.  But we have other things like marriage enrichment ministry. Obviously, divorce is an issue in the community inside and out of the church.  So we try to do ministry that will help couples get through hard times.  So we have a marriage enrichment ministry.  We have a very--youth ministry, which we started maybe fifteen years ago, where they have their own church and they do their own service because we feel that, obviously, we should be the training ground for the future church.  So we have started that youth church.  We have a very viable church school.  We have of course, the young adult ministry, a very strong young adult ministry, a singles ministry.  And we do little things like ministry to infertile couples, ministry for people who are--we have a strong AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] and HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] ministry, because obviously people are affected and infected with HIV and AIDS.  So, we think it's important that we certainly observe our context and have something in place where people can go.  We have a cancer support ministry, a plethora of ministries that we try--that we have instituted to fill the needs of the single mothers ministry, single parents, single fathers ministry.  We have a finance ministry which has done a tremendous job in this climate of recession and foreclosures.  You know, they had banks down in the basement of the church, and they were re-working loans.  So we really strive to be relevant to our context, and relevant to the times.  You can't do the ministry in 2010 that you did in 2000 even.  Because it's an ever evolving, ever changing society.  And so the church has to respond to what's going on.
Story_ID: 638266
Speaker 1: Did you think the A.M.E. church is really keeping up with what's going on to the extent that they should?  I--the founding of the A.M.E. church as an African Methodist Episcopal church by Richard Allen was a tremendous event in the history of black people, and was at the cutting edge of a lot of things when--they took people to Haiti when Haiti was in--they did a, you know, work all over the world.
Speaker 2: I think the A.M.E. church has lost a little of its edge.  But let me say this.  Let me emphasize the positive first.  I think that the A.M.E. church is still, their presence is in South Africa, West Africa.  They ha- they still, you know, we send bishops to Zimbabwe and Botswana.  We have, the A.M.E. church's presence is there.  The A.M.E. church's presence is in Haiti and in Jamaica.  And those--and so I do feel that the A.M.E. church is still very, very mission minded to a degree.  I think that--you know, we send our bishops over there, and we try to support them.  We bring them over here, certainly wanting to make them feel a part of the larger denomination.  So, I think that the A.M.E. church still is a trailblazer in that regard.  I, I do feel that in terms of the move of the church, the larger--the church universal here in this country--I think that we may be lagging behind a little bit.  I think we're still solid when it comes to social consciousness.  I appreciate it about the A.M.E. church that we--you know, because some churches and some denominations, you know, they're, they don't even--you know, we're still encouraging people to vote.  We're registering voters and very involved in the political arena.  So, I do think that the A.M.E. church is relevant there.  I think that we're not as cutting edge in ministry, you know, the larger church.  Now, there are some churches who are doing it.  But I think, you know, we're losing members because I think there has been a clinging to a tradition that does not work in 2010.  I, I think that we have--now, Allen [Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York] of course is an exception, I think, as well as a few other churches in the denomination.  But if you look at the larger church, I think that it may be losing a little of its relevance.
Speaker 1: Kind of lost its edge in terms of--
Speaker 2: I think it's lost its edge (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) hitting social justice issues.
Speaker 2: I think we still hit the issues.  It's just that we haven't hit--we haven't--to be honest, I think that our pastors have become more political within the denomination than they are effective in the local church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, some of the political activity inside the church becomes (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, you know, everybody wants to be a bishop, and everybody wants to go to the next level, and they're looking at the next church.  And I'm here today, but I want to go here tomorrow.  I just, (laughter) you know, I just think it has become so political.
Story_ID: 638267
Speaker 1: I wonder, now I don't know.  I know I grew up in the C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] church.  And I know the bishops move pastors around all the time.  How has Reverend Flake [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake] and yourself managed to stay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I shouldn't put these glasses on, okay, I'm sorry. [TW1]
Speaker 1: How have you managed to stay in the same church for so long, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, we, my husband's desire was to raise his children in one church, in one place.  So he came in determined that he could stay at Allen [Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York] all his life, if necessary.  And he was going to do his work so that nobody would ever think that it would be necessary to move him.  So, he, he came in building and expanding and buying.  And so, there was never any question that he would be moved.
Speaker 1: Is that unusual in the denomination?
Speaker 2: It is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To stay in the--
Speaker 2: Well, see, and I think that one of the, one of the things that would work in our denomination is if more people had that attitude.  See, you know, between--if I move to a church in Hempstead [New York], or to a church in Brooklyn [New York]--Brooklyn is replete with possibilities, with prospects.  But many times, the pastors who go to Brooklyn because they hate--they don't like the building, or they don't like the area--they're looking to go to another church instead of staying right where they are, and developing--
Speaker 1: That's what you mean by the political energy being used to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --move the individual along, rather than--
Speaker 2: And one of the things that I think--and I think you'll agree with the C.M.E. model.  What happens is you take--you know, whoever runs for bishop, these are your talented people, these are your productive pastors.  You take them out of their local churches, you make them Bishops, and then the church that they were in is no longer a reckoning force within the community, because there's a new pastor there who nobody knows.  So, because--now, if Floyd would run for bishop, the person--I mean he's got a thirty-four year reputation.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's probably going to win.
Speaker 2: The person who comes--he would win perhaps--but the person who comes after him is now starting over.  Nobody knows him, he'll be Floyd Flake's successor.  Whereas, if Floyd could be a bishop and stay at Allen, then he could do his work and then he would also be that presence in the community, and his church would remain strong.  See, one of our problems is that that church which was strong, when the replacement comes in, many times it becomes weaker.  It becomes weak, and so that's not a good model in my opinion.
Story_ID: 638268
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, and I guess it's probably time to ask it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) how much time do I have?  Well, my concern for the African American community is first with my youth.  I just feel that our children have lost a sense of community.  I think they've lost that sense of history, or historicity.  I, I, I, see a generation that is, has been so privileged.  I think the Baby Boomers, that's my generation, I think we've not done the best job in terms of helping our children to, and our grandchildren to appreciate their history and appreciate the milestones that have been made.  And that's the middle class.  But then I'm seeing this other group of kids who, you know, anytime you can look on television and see 'The Housewives of Atlanta' ['The Real Housewives of Atlanta'] and 'Bobby and Whitney' [sic. 'Being Bobby Brown'] those things, I think there's a dumbing down of America.  And I think that our children are in the middle of it.  And I'm--that's scary to me, when you can, you know, see kids still with their pants hanging below their behinds.  And you know, I'm--that's my real concern, is that our young people are getting further and further away from constructive and productive living; you know, the breakdown of the family, you know, so many babies without fathers in the home.  That, that--because I see it at the school.  I see the impact of it.  I'm not saying that no single mother can raise a child, you know, a productive child.  That's certainly not what I'm saying.  But I'm saying that I am concerned about the breakdown of the family and where I see our kids going.  The mentality is what scares me, the mentality of our kids.  What they see is good, versus what we know as not to be, you know, not to be good.  So I think that the media, I think the music, television, has conspired, whether it was intentional or not.  But I think they have come together and they have really stolen something very valuable from our young people--a sense of pride, a sense of dignity, a sense of self, that would help them to overcome obstacles and to reject a lot of the negative images and a lot of the negative behavior that they have not rejected, but have begun to embrace.  That is, that's really my concern.  I just, I'm scared.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I'm just scared for our young people.
Story_ID: 638269
Speaker 1: What do you think--I should have asked this earlier.  But I'm just thinking, like what do you bring to the ministry and the other women in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church?  What are you bringing to the ministry that wasn't there before in the A.M.E. church?  Or maybe in general.
Speaker 2: I think we've given women a voice.  I think that we are not afraid to talk about spousal abuse.  We talk about rape, incest, things that brothers have never touched.  I think that the women preachers, the woman preacher, has brought to the forefront some issues that were pushed to the back in our writing, in our preaching, in our programming.  I just had a women's conference over in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And I talked about--you know, we had classes on things like childlessness, raising children, overcoming divorce, getting rid of the anger, getting rid of the bitterness.  I feel that ministry to women is what my generation in particular--Vashti [HistoryMaker Bishop Vashti McKenzie], Cecelia Bryant [Cecelia Williams-Bryant]--I think we have been very, we have been the trailblazers.  And I hate to say it, because I'm not tooting my horn.  But we have been the ones who have helped women deal with their issues, their feelings.  We've not been afraid to talk about it, and we've not been afraid to deal with it, to help women to express themselves and hear what they need to hear in order to overcome divorce, in order to overcome years of rape or incest.  We've not been afraid to do that.  And I think that that has helped.  One of my things about women's ministry and the ministry to children--I wanted to do a real strong prison ministry.  And I brought a man in from the prison system, and I don't remember his name.  But he said, "If you really want to do prison ministry, you need to start at school.  If you really want to do prison ministry, you need to deal with women."  He said, "Because if you can have children in a safe and positive environment, and then if you can help heal their mothers, then you will impact the prison industry, and it is an industry."  So, that stuck with me.  And I do feel that in healing and ministering to women, I'm helping the children.  And I, of course feel that the Allen Christian School [Queens, New York] is an environment in which children are steered toward positive living and toward college.  And so I think that those are two critical, critical, areas that my generation, especially with the--you know, I've been having women's conferences for twenty-seven years, for twenty-seven years, dealing with those kinds of issues; helping women to heal, helping women to be focused, helping them to see themselves as overcomers and victors.  And every year I get feedback on Facebook, you know, "Life changing, I'll never be the same."  And that's what you want.
Story_ID: 638270
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, and you're still young--as a matter of fact, we're almost the same age (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, well--
Speaker 1: So, I'd like to think of you as young (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Don't tell me that.  I don't feel so young (laughter).
Speaker 1: But as you look back on everything, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: From a professional perspective?  I guess probably, I would probably do something like go and take a few more courses in counseling.  I jokingly say that I probably would have gone to law school, but I don't know if that's the case.
Story_ID: 638271
Speaker 1: But I, I, I think God has been good.  I kind of, you know, the, the, the patterns that--well, the course that the ministry took was good.  We did the senior citizens in '80 [1980], the school in '83 [1983], and the Women's Resource Center [Allen Women's Resource Center, Queens, New York] in '83 [1983] and '84 [1984].  And I thought, I think that's good.  The school has certainly been my baby, that, you know, I've really spent a lot of time and a lot of prayers trying to keep that going.
Speaker 2: Would you consider that the major part of your legacy?
Speaker 1: I would have to say the school and the women's ministry, ministry to women.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I mean my four children came through Allen Christian School [Queens, New York].  So, in an effort--I mean I saw firsthand the weaknesses and strengths of it, and worked to overcome the weaknesses.  Now my granddaughter's over there, and there're many second generation children over there, so that's a good thing.
Story_ID: 638272
Speaker 1: The last question--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is similar to legacy, but a little different.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would really like to be remembered as the founder of the Allen Christian School [Queens, New York], and as one who did serious and productive ministry to women.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was, that's how I would like to be remembered.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some people would say, as a woman in ministry--you know, and I don't really consider myself a trailblazer, because you've got Jarena Lee, you've got--I can't think of the lady's name, I just--Mary Watson Stewart.  And you've got other women who were preaching long before me.  But I think if I could be thought about as a trailblazer in ministry, it would be because of ministry to women.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And kind of, kind of introducing, being a part of this new co-pastor paradigm that has come to, you know, come to the forefront in these last ten to fifteen years.  Now you see a lot of couples in ministry together, as Reverend and Reverend.  In previous years, it was Reverend and Mrs.  Now, they're a whole lot of Reverends and Reverends.  And that, and we kind of helped start that.  I mean we, I won't say we started it, but we were some of the first.
Speaker 1: I suppose there's a big difference between being first lady and being co-pastor.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Well, no.  I jokingly say to some people, now I'm just paid to do what I (laughter) what I did for free for the first fifteen years.  (Laughter) But, you know, obviously preaching every Sunday.  But, but, but the day to day tasks with the women and the missionaries, I still do that.  And I was doing that when I came; I was just doing more.  But a lot of the stuff I started doing in '76 [1976], I'm still doing.
