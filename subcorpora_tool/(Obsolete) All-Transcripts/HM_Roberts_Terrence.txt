Story_ID: 473927
Speaker 1: Now after we ask these questions--we have a few things we like to ask you that are more People magazine-ish type questions.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And just bear with me for a moment as we ask these few questions.  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Ha, that is People (laughter). I, I have no clue, actually.  I like so many things, so it's hard to nail it down.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And if you just had to pick one, would you pick anything in any category of food that you might like?
Speaker 2: Well, it would depend on time of day, day of week, temperature, mindset (laughter).
Speaker 1: And the time of year for you, your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your favorite color, should you have one?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: And your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Ooh, probably Paris, France.
Speaker 1: Any particular reason?
Speaker 2: No.  It's just something about that place that's compelling.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a favorite saying or a phrase that you have that stands out that you use or really is important to you?
Speaker 2: There's something I used to say to my kids all the time, two words:  pay attention.  I like that.
Speaker 1: Pay attention.
Story_ID: 473928
Speaker 1: Now I wanna go forward a bit, and I'd like you to tell us about your mother.  What was her name?
Speaker 2: My mom was Margaret Roberts [Margaret Gill Roberts].
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Little Rock [Arkansas] also.
Speaker 1: And did she grow up in Little Rock?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about her background and her growing up as a child?
Speaker 2: She was born in Little Rock, and as a very young person, her family moved to Kansas City, Missouri.  At age twelve her own mom died in childbirth.  She returned to Little Rock to live with her grandmother [Elizabeth Jeter] and finished high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School] in Little Rock, living with her grandmother, got married to my dad [William Roberts] in 1920.
Speaker 1: Was she the only sibling or be--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --before the, before the childbirth?
Speaker 2: No.  She had three brothers and one sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how would you describe your mother as a person?
Speaker 2: I would say she probably merits the label of having been the most inclusive person on the face of the earth.  She loved people.  She enjoyed being around them.  But what stood out for her was she made no distinction or differentiation be, between people.  She saw all people as her peers.  She never looked up to anybody or down on anybody.
Speaker 1: Did she have any stories or events in her life that she shared with you as a child about her childhood, anything that stands out that you can recall today?
Speaker 2: Not really.  She didn't talk much about that, except I know that she, she worked very hard.
Story_ID: 473929
Speaker 1: And how about your father?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: William Roberts.  He too was born in Little Rock [Arkansas].  He and my mom [Margaret Gill Roberts] went to the same high school, Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School], which was the high school for black people in Little Rock.  So, during that era, all black people who went to high school--went to public high school--went to Dunbar.  He comes from a family of five siblings, one brother and three sisters.
Speaker 1: And did you parents meet at high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They met at Dunbar.
Speaker 1: Now this is a question I like to ask: how'd you describe your father?
Speaker 2: My father was a hardworking man.  He never held less than three jobs at any one time.  He was a shoemaker by trade.  He worked at the Bottom Dollar Shoestore [ph.] in Little Rock, and he worked at other smaller shops as well.  He also worked at the Veterans Administration hospital in North Little Rock [Arkansas], so he was constantly going from job to job.
Speaker 1: Did he have any stories or events that he may have told you about growing up as far as his childhood or how he be- how he developed his work ethic?
Speaker 2: Not so much about the work ethic.  He told me a little bit about his childhood.  He had a, what he called, a, a very good an interesting childhood.  He, he joined the [U.S.] Navy when we were in World War II [WWII].  Interesting story about that: he couldn't swim, but somehow he got into the Navy.
Speaker 1: How old would he have been at this time when he got into the Navy?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see, he probably would have been around twenty years old.
Speaker 1: And he got into the Navy without swimming.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 473930
Speaker 1: Do you know about your grandparents on your mother's [Margaret Gill Roberts] side?
Speaker 2: I knew my grandmother [sic. great-grandmother] on my mom's side.  That's the woman that my mom lived with when she came back to Little Rock [Arkansas].  Her name was Elizabeth Jeter.  That's spelled J-E-T-E-R.  I remember her.  She, she was very stern but loving woman.  She lived there in Little Rock, and she too was a hard worker.  I remember that much about her.
Speaker 1: And how about her father?
Speaker 2: I didn't know him.
Story_ID: 473931
Speaker 1: And your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: I knew my paternal grandmother, again.  My grandfather [Herman Roberts] I think died quite early.  But my dad's [William Roberts] mom I knew.  Eventually I actually spent time living with her when I moved from Little Rock [Arkansas] to California.  Her name was Lucille Roberts.  In fact, she and my dad's other siblings moved to California from Little Rock in the early '40s [1940s].  He was the only one of that clan who stayed behind in Little Rock.
Speaker 1: So in 1940 they moved to, to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: --to Los Angeles.
Story_ID: 473932
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your childhood.  What was your earliest memory growing up as a child?
Speaker 2: Wow, earliest memory.  I think probably living on a street called Izard Street in Little Rock [Arkansas], and I was probably four or five years old.  Just remember there were a lot of kids in the neighborhood.  There were, at that point in our, in our family's life, there were four of us, eventually to be seven, but there were four at that time.  And across the street from us lived a family of fifteen kids, the Gillam family.  The Ziglers [ph.] were next door to them; they had three kids.  And there were several other families.  I, I estimate there were about forty kids on our one block.
Speaker 1: Busy block. What were your children--I mean your siblings' names?  In the order, where do you fall in the order of siblings?
Speaker 2: I'm number two.  My older sister is Juereta Dale Roberts [Juereta Roberts Smith], now Smith; I'm two.  Next in line is Beverly Ann Roberts [Beverly Roberts Rhodes], now Rhodes, followed by Janice Marie Roberts [Janice Roberts], who is now Janice Zino [ph.].  The next one in line is William Edward Roberts [William Roberts], then Jerome Herman Roberts [Jerome Roberts], and finally, Margaret Elizabeth Roberts [Margaret Roberts Daniels], now Daniels.
Speaker 1: What was life like in a household of that many children?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was interesting.  One thing that people always used to remark about was even though there were seven of us living in fairly close proximity, there were no fights.  We didn't fight.  And I attribute that to instructions from my mom [Margaret Gill Roberts], who told us all when we were quite young that even though we were animals, but we were human animals; we didn't have to fight.  The lower animals she said would fight because they, they have no brains, see, or very small brains.  They have no power of speech.  They can't resolve differences except through fighting.  So we never fought, and that puts the lie to something called sibling rivalry.  We just didn't have it.
Story_ID: 473933
Speaker 1: And on that street on you- in your block, you mentioned there were many children.  How was life like on that street, outside playing, things of that nature? Was that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, wonderful, wonderful.  I can remember all kinds of things, especially in summer.  We'd spend long hours just playing, having a great time.
Speaker 1: You mentioned a few names of your neighbors, the Ziglers [ph.] and people like that.  Could you describe how that, how they were, how--and were they instrumental in your life at all?
Speaker 2: Well, jus- as, as neighbors, and, and we were a close community.  Actually, when you think about it, because of the oppressive segregation in Little Rock [Arkansas] and the fact that black people were forced to live near each other across economic lines, so we, we lived very close to lots of people, many of whom were economically well-off, others who were not.  So, we talked; we communicated; we interacted; we went to church together; we had social activities together.  And of course, this included all the neighbors I mentioned plus others.
Speaker 1: So you attended church in your home quite a bit?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, church, ha, yeah.  They don't call the South the Bible Belt for nothing, you know.  We spent a lot of time in church.
Speaker 1: And what, what, were you Baptist or--
Speaker 2: No, no.  I was Seventh Adventist [Seventh-day Adventist], which at the time was, I, I was somewhat of an outlier, because the majority of my friends were either Baptist or Methodist.
Story_ID: 473934
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, sounds, and smells that you can recall as a child in your neighborhood, in your home?  What were some of those things?
Speaker 2: There was a tamale wagon that used to come by in the mornings, run by a Mexican man, and he would call out, "Hot tamales, hot tamales."  And then in the evening, he would go the other way, "Cold tamales, cold tamales."  I remember that, a sight and the sound; sounds of kids running around mainly; the ice man.  The ice man would come, and we had little cards we'd put in the window with numbers on them whether we wanted ten pounds, or fifteen pounds, or twenty-five pounds of ice to put in the icebox.  And I remember that.
Story_ID: 473935
Speaker 1: Do you have any other memories growing up, anything that stands out for you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, lots of other things.  We had not only the delivery of ice, we had milk delivered.  Now that, I mention that because that's something that is pretty much passe these days--workmen or delivery people coming to the house, bringing needed products.  And I think because we didn't have proper refrigeration, we had to restock often.  But I also remember spending a lot of time at the place called the Dunbar Community Center, which was a community center built for black people in Little Rock [Arkansas].  It was sort of a place where people gathered socially, kids to play games, adults to have social functions.
Speaker 1: And growing up there and at the Dunbar Center and things, what were some of the activities and thing that you participated in?
Speaker 2: Well, all manner of sports activities, you know, indoor games, outdoor games, using all manner of balls too, and also just to hang out, you know, spend time talking.
Story_ID: 473936
Speaker 1: And do you remember your experiences we mentioned earlier about church?  Do you recall how were your, your experience personally going to church?  Did you enjoy it?  Were you just doing it because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.  No, I, I loved church.  It, it was in- interesting.  I also discovered very early on in, in, my experience in church that church was not a place where only people who believed strongly in principles of faith were present.  A lot of sinners hung out at church. So that, that was important for me to learn very early on.
Story_ID: 473937
Speaker 1: Do you recall your elementary school, the first one that you attended?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  That would be Gibbs Elementary [Gibbs Elementary School; Gibbs Magnet Elementary School, Little Rock, Arkansas], Gibbs Elementary, which was named for Mifflin W. Gibbs [Mifflin Wistar Gibbs], who was the first black judge in Arkansas, in Little Rock [Arkansas], M.W. Gibbs Elementary School, grades one through sixth.  My first grade teacher was Ms. Wong [ph.].  And I remember her because she was the first teacher who told me along with all the other first graders that we had to become executives in charge of our own learning.  So I took on CEO responsibility of that process very early, thanks to her.
Speaker 1: Were there any other teachers there in the school that influenced you or any other people in the school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And names?
Speaker 2: Mrs., Mrs. Darzell [ph.].  My other teacher that I remember is Mr. Cann [ph.].  He taught elementary school as well.  I don't remember many of the other names, but those stand out.
Speaker 1: What were some of the lessons that you learned, besides the one that she taught you about being the executive of your own, your own education?
Speaker 2: Well, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What else did you learn?
Speaker 2: --early on, we were told that education was so important in, in life.  All of us heard those messages over and over from grade to grade.  And so, very quickly I understood that education was something that I really had to attend to, had to understand it, had to make sense out of it.  The other lessons we got were basic life lessons.  I remember in junior high [Paul Laurence Dunbar Junior High School, Little Rock, Arkansas]--now I'm in grade seven, the first year of junior high school, and my homeroom teacher was a Mrs. Dozier [ph.].  And she took it upon herself to instruct us in things related to sexual relations without parental consent.  She would simply close the door to our homeroom every morning and talk to us in very direct terms about who we were as sexual beings and how to be responsible sexual persons.  And her message was very simple: to the boys keep your pants zipped up; to the girls, keep your panties on.
Story_ID: 473938
Speaker 1: So what kind of student were you during, during your elementary years [at Gibbs Elementary School; Gibbs Magnet Elementary School, Little Rock, Arkansas]?  Were you a, a, a very, a books--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I was, I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) academic person?
Speaker 2: --I was a very good student.  Yeah, I would be considered an academic.  I, I picked up the name nerd very early.  I used to wander around reading a dictionary.  I took a dictionary to lunch with me.  And that was because I'd discovered from one of my teachers that if English was to be the language of discourse, social, economic discourse, then I should master the language.  And so I, I took it at face value.
Speaker 1: Now that was your student activities.  What kind of a basic child were you in the home?  Were you well-mannered?  Were you somewhat mischievous?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no, very mild-mannered, easygoing, peace-loving.  I've always been the same; I've never changed (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now as a youngster, what were some of your dreams and aspirations that you had for, for your future?
Speaker 2: I, I can't remember having any one thing that stands out.  I would flip from one thing to another, depending upon what was more exciting in a given day.
Speaker 1: And what were some of those things?
Speaker 2: Law, medicine, engineering, mathematics, social work.  Psychology was a, a late choice for me.  That only came much later in life.
Story_ID: 473939
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: Dunbar Junior High [Paul Laurence Dunbar Junior High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who were some of your friends there, anybody that we might know or anybody that also came out of Dunbar Junior High that might be of note?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  You know, when you think about it, Dunbar Junior High, and prior to that time it had been Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Little Rock, Arkansas], and there are a number of graduates from, from that high school that have done outstanding things.  Sidney Williams [Sidney Williams, Jr.] was a graduate of Dunbar High.  He was the first black quarterback in the Big Ten [Big Ten Conference].  And one of his classmates, Jim Pace, also played football in the Big Ten.  He ran halfback.  Those guys I remember because those were the upperclassmen that I looked up to.
Story_ID: 473940
Speaker 1: Now, as a young person, what or who influenced you besides your parents [Margaret Gill Roberts and William Roberts] and the teachers?  Were there any outside sources, in the media, anybody else that really influenced you?  Now, you said--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --those two guys [Sidney Williams, Jr. and Jim Pace], but--
Speaker 2: --yeah.  They, they were not so much influences, but I just knew about them, and I admired what they did.  But for me, role models or people who influenced me were basically any, anybody that I encountered who consistently made healthy choices in life.  I always admired people who could figure out how to make healthy choices for themselves.  That was of great interest to me.
Speaker 1: At that point, what did you consider healthy choices, at that--
Speaker 2: Choices that led to an individual's ability to maximize whatever potential he or she had brought into the universe.  An example of a, a healthy choice would be to, to choose not to smoke cigarettes, for instance.  That just makes sense.  I mean that's a good example, of course, but anything like that, taking care of body, taking care of mind, taking care of spirit, making those kinds of choices.
Speaker 1: So you appreciated the teacher that, that, that really talked to you openly about sexuality at that early age?  That was--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely a healthy choice.
Speaker 1: How did most of the children in your class receive that information when she did that?
Speaker 2: I think it was generally well-received.  Of course, there were some who, (laughter) who wouldn't receive anything.  You know, always in, in each group there are, there's a certain percentage of people, in this case kids, who chose not to listen.
Speaker 1: That being an earlier period in life, in, at around the time that the Kinsey Report ['Sexual Behavior in the Human Male' and 'Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'] was coming out and those kinds of materials, were, were the parents open to that, that she was doing that?  Was there any backlash from the parental or the administrative staff of the school [Paul Laurence Dunbar Junior High School, Little Rock, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: Parents weren't involved.  Like I said, she had no parental consent.  And I don't know.  I, I suppose if my parents had found out, if I'd shared with them, it would have been okay.  My parents were fairly open people.
Speaker 1: And being a, a very religious community also, I'm sure there may have been some things you re- what, what were the, what were the dominant feelings there about those kind of things?  Was it a hidden subject at that time or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, oh, absolutely.  You know, almost in any era that you can think of, at least since I've been around, sex has been pretty much a taboo subject; hard for parents and kids to talk about it.
Story_ID: 473941
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're gonna move into your high school, your first high school ex- your experiences when you go into high school.  Now we're gonna get into a very crucial part of your life as we go forward.  What was the first high school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Horace Mann High [Horace Mann High School; Horace Mann Magnet Middle School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  That was the all-black high school.  Once Dunbar had been turned into a junior high [Paul Laurence Dunbar Junior High School, Little Rock, Arkansas], Horace Mann became the high school for black kids.
Speaker 1: Horace Mann High.  And what was the feeling and the attitude around there basically in the school at that time?  What year would this have been actually for you?
Speaker 2: That would have been 1956, '57 [1957].  That was my tenth grade year.
Speaker 1: Okay, and right there we're still, we're still in the South.  Are things still segregated at this point?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And was, what was the attitude at your high school about segregation and the overall general?  Was it one of acceptance?  Was there change going on in your class?  What was the--
Speaker 2: Well, this was post-1954.  Of course, the Brown decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] had been rendered, so there was this attitude of expectation, hope in the air that things would, would change.  Buses in Little Rock [Arkansas] had been desegregated in, in 1954.  So there was some expectation that, ah, maybe we're reaching the end of an era here, that at some point very soon we'll get rid of these barriers.
Story_ID: 473942
Speaker 1: Now could we go back for a moment and discuss as a child or a youngster being in a segregated environment, going downtown, doing different things where you could actually see, see the differences or see what was going on, the Jim Crow?  Could you explain your feeling and what you saw, what your thoughts were at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was shocked and confused initially.  Once I discovered what was going on, none of it made sense.  It was absolutely insane that there would be these lines of separation, walls of separation, really, between groups of people based simply on, on racial group membership.  So I, I had a hard time figuring it out, and I'd ask questions.  Mainly though the responses were this is the way it is; deal with it.  But it didn't seem quite possible for me to do that, except I understood also that unless I learned the rules of segregation and obeyed them, I could be killed.
Speaker 1: So there were coping mechanisms and defense mechanisms that were intrinsic.  You just learned those things that--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, you learned how to navigate the terrain, just automatically (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Could you give us some examples?
Speaker 2: Well, you, for instance, learned that if you were disrespectful to a white person, you could actually be killed.  And, and that was given even more weight when Emmett Till was killed in Mississippi.  Mississippi is geographically contiguous to Arkansas.  So Emmett Till and I are actually the same age.  Had he lived, we would be exactly the same age.  So when he was killed I thought, wow, what would stop those same people from crossing the border into Arkansas and killing me too?  So in events like that, underscored the need to know the rules of segregation and obey them.  I went dutifully to the back of the bus.  I went to the balcony in theaters.  I would go to the back door of restaurants, et cetera, et cetera, all because that was expected.
Speaker 1: So was the attempt to integrate, but it was always with the segregationalist cap above it.  So you, you would go places where everybody went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, there, there was no attempt to integrate, no.  This was all segregation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what, my question is, are, were there things that you could have done that would not have required you to do that?  Were there any theaters or things in the neighborhood [in Little Rock, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, there was a black theater, one, that I could go to, and I did go there.  I went there mostly, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And that, then you could just go in the front door and--
Speaker 2: Yes, at that point.  If it were all-black, then there were no restrictions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 473943
Speaker 1: What were some of your activities in high school at Horace Mann [Horace Mann High School; Horace Mann Magnet Middle School, Little Rock, Arkansas]?  What were some of your, what was your, you know, extracurricular, your social life?  We know you were a great student.
Speaker 2: Well, I did musical things; I was in the choir; I ran track; I participated in student government, those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: And what teachers there at high school were very influential with this?
Speaker 2: I had a music teacher there named Mr. Ransom [ph.] who was, who was very influential; the shop teacher.  I can't remember.  I had a science teacher, Mr. Elston [ph.].  I think perhaps I remember most English teacher, and I'm blocking on his name right now.  But what I like about him was he, he very gently challenged each one of us in his class to go one step further, to do better than we thought we could.
Speaker 1: And while you were there, were there any other students that, that, that we might know that were very influential you, to you even if we don't know them?  Was there anybody that was--other students that were either peers or, or, or competitive people for you that--in school?
Speaker 2: Well, there were a number of them.  I can't remember off hand all the names.  But yeah, I would say all the kids who were in my class, tenth grade class, at, at Horace Mann that year represented my school community primarily because we tended to group ourselves according to class level, you know, grades ten, eleven, or twelve.  So all the tenth grade class there in '56 [1956] I would count as my group.
Speaker 1: And you all did your things together and--
Speaker 2: Did a lot of things together, yeah.  In fact, we, we actually studied together, sort of spurring each other on.
Speaker 1: Now you're in high school, and you're in the tenth grade, which would be your sophomore year of high school.  Did you have any, any idea of what it was you wanted to be at this point?  Were you in (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, nothing specific, no.  All, all opportunities were open as far as I was concerned at that point.
Speaker 1: And you were there for two years.
Speaker 2: One year.
Speaker 1: One year.  And this is 1956 we say (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifty-six [1956] to '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: To '57 [1957].
Story_ID: 473944
Speaker 1: There is a, a event that's that getting ready to take place in which you're going to be involved in.  Would you like to give us a little information on that as we go into it?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  What had happened: the school board in Little Rock [Arkansas] decided to desegregate Central High School [Little Rock, Arkansas].  Now this was after other plans had sort of fallen apart.  Initially, they wanted to integrate kindergarten through third grade.  The problem with that was that everybody in town knew it would work, and the citizens of Little Rock confronted the school board.  They were forced to abandon that plan, and the compromise was grades ten, eleven, and twelve.  Once that was settled, then the school board sent representatives to Horace Mann High [Horace Mann High School; Horace Mann Magnet Middle School, Little Rock, Arkansas], the all-black school, where they laid out the plan for all of us students.  And once that was done, they said okay, how many of you would like to volunteer for this?  I think at that time there were probably about 150 of us who volunteered.  And the plan was that in September 1957 this group of 150 black kids would then go to Central High School.  That was the beginning.  Now, that was in the spring of '57 [1957].  Between the spring of '57 [1957] and September of '57 [1957], a lot of things happened to dwindle, to dwiddle those numbers down to nine.
Speaker 1: Now, at that time period, Central High School is an all-white school at this point?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: All-white school, and Horace Mann is the all-black school.  There, there's already a decision passed in '54 [1954], the--in, in '54 [1954] that's, that's already in place--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at, at this point.  So Arkansas was just a little bit coming to waking up to the decision.  Is that--
Speaker 2: So to speak, right.
Speaker 1: So to speak, so we're into it.
Story_ID: 473945
Speaker 1: We're back, and now we're in 1955, and Virgil Blossom [Virgil T. Blossom], who was the superintendent of schools at that time, had a plan for desegregation, and, and it was approved, correct?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now you're about fifteen, fourteen, fifteen years old now when this decision is made.  And you said there were 150 volunteers--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --to, to go to Central [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  And what happened between the end of the school year and the beginning of the next school year?
Speaker 2: Well, for one thing, there was constant pressure on the school board from the white citizens of, of Little Rock [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay, it's 1955.  You're fourteen years old.  You're attending Horace Mann High School [Horace Mann Magnet Middle School, Little Rock, Arkansas], the all-black high school.  And Virgil Blossom, who was the superintendent of schools at that time, had a plan for desegregation of the, of Little Rock high school.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And it was approved.
Speaker 1: Plan was approved.
Speaker 2: Unanimously.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So now you're there, and they, they do, they come to Horace Mann to look for students to be part of this new plan.
Speaker 1: Right, they need volunteers.
Speaker 2: And they get how many?
Speaker 1: About 150.
Speaker 2: And this is sometime in May, correct?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, about May, April or May--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --of '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: And there are 150 students that volunteered.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now what happened between that and the beginning of the next school year?
Speaker 1: Well, one thing was that a lot of white citizens of Little Rock didn't like the fact that this thing was going forward, so they pressured the school board to change their mind, to do something different.  So the school board--rumor has it--I don't know this to be sure, but rumor has it that the school board started some selection from the 150, sifting through the group to see, quote, who qualified.  Now, rumor further has it that the school board's intent was to whittle the group down to zero through the screening process.  The third part of the rumor is that the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] got wind of this, stepped in, and told the school board cease and desist the screening.  By that time, there were about fifteen or seventeen of us.  And then, because of the rumors of blood flowing in the streets, specifically our blood flowing in the streets, some parents pulled their kids out.  Some kids voluntarily removed themselves, until finally there were nine of us.
Speaker 2: So there were nine in, would we say, September of the following year when it--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --when school started?
Speaker 1: Actually, the night before school there were ten.  We would have been the Little Rock Ten.  But the father of the tenth child--her name's Jane Hill--he received a telephone call from his employer with the message: if you send Jane to school tomorrow, don't bother coming back to work.
Story_ID: 473946
Speaker 1: Now, what was the decision process by which, you know, you volunteer- tell me what happened.  What was the decision process for that?
Speaker 2: Well, basically it was: here is the plan we've come up with; here's what we want to do with Central [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas];   how many of you want to attend?  That simple.  Then it was just a show of hands.
Speaker 1: Now, in your own personal life, what prompted you to want to volunteer?
Speaker 2: Well, the mere fact that I didn't believe that this was the right thing to do, to have a segregated society.  That was so clear in my mind.  It made no sense.  It actually made no sense.  In fact, at one time I thought all white people were crazy.  So this to me was an opportunity to change things around.  It was not only the right thing to do, but it was time for the right thing to happen.
Speaker 1: And what did your parents [Margaret Gill Roberts and William Roberts] feel about that?  How did they feel about that?
Speaker 2: They were 100 percent in favor of this. When I came home and reported to them that I had volunteered, they said, "Okay, we'll support you 100 percent."  But they also said, "If you get up there, and it's too hot and you want to quit, we'll support your decision to quit 100 percent."  And I think they added that last bit because they knew even more than I did how dangerous this was going to be.
Speaker 1: Now, was the general feeling that the school, that Central had more to offer you educationally?  Did you feel that there was more for you to learn?  So was there excitement or anticipation going to get something that you weren't getting at Horace Mann [Horace Mann High School; Horace Mann Magnet Middle School, Little Rock, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  We, we were getting a really good education at Mann, but the idea was simply to have choice.  Central was my neighborhood school.  I lived six blocks away from Central.
Speaker 1: How far was Horace Mann?
Speaker 2: A bus ride to downtown Little Rock [Arkansas], then a transfer to another bus to the east side of town out near the airport.  It was a long way away, and I had to do that at my own expense.  There were no public funds for that transportation, so that was an out-of-pocket expense that I had to bear.
Speaker 1: And were there many students that had to do that in Little Rock?
Speaker 2: If you were black and in high school, you had to make your way to Horace Mann.
Story_ID: 473947
Speaker 1: Now, that night before you said there was one more, and it would have been, it would have been the ten of Little Rock [Arkansas]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Little Rock Ten, but his [sic. her] father pulled him due to his employer threatening him.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So the night before, how was that night for you, you realizing that tomorrow is gonna be a special day for you?
Speaker 2: Well, believe it or not, it, it was not an upsetting night.  It was fairly typical a night because it, the next day would be the first day of school, not only for me but for some of my siblings as well.  So we spent the time sort of preparing for the first day of school.  And that was always sort of a fun ritual because you always got new stuff to wear.
Story_ID: 473948
Speaker 1: Now the other students, the other eight, were you friends with those people, or did you know them?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And were the, what was the conversation like maybe a day or two days or maybe even a week before?  What were--did you all talk and communicate?
Speaker 2: We did, but I don't think there was any communication about what we might expect there or what might happen.  It was more: ah, this is going to happen; we're involved; we're gonna do it.
Speaker 1: Who were the other eight by name--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Ernest Green, who was the lone senior in our group, and then there were five of us who were juniors.  On my group, my class group, there were four women.  And those four were Melba Beals [Melba Pattillo Beals], Elizabeth Eckford, Thelma Mothershed [Thelma Mothershed Wair], and Minnijean Brown [Minnijean Brown Trickey].  Then there were three kids who were tenth graders, again, one male in that group, Jefferson Thomas, Carlotta Walls [HistoryMaker Carlotta Walls LaNier], and Gloria Ray [Gloria Ray Karlmark].
Story_ID: 473949
Speaker 1: Now prior to the, this day, was there a lot of media buzz?  And the media wasn't like it is nowadays, but, but was there a lot of information or anticipation of a problem beginning the day of school?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh yeah, absolutely.  The governor himself was on television.  See, television was in its infancy.  Some people were just getting TVs.  Not everybody had televisions, but those who did have, allowed other people to come and watch.  And so the governor was on television talking about armed caravans coming into Little Rock [Arkansas].  Mayhem was going to break out, riots, blood flowing, all of that stuff.
Speaker 1: So who was the mayor at that time?
Speaker 2: Good question.  I'm not sure who the mayor was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who was the governor at that time?
Speaker 2: The governor was Orval Faubus.
Speaker 1: Orval Faubus.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, so the night before you have--you're getting ready to go to school [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  It's the first day of school, which is a great period for kids.  And what did your parents [Margaret Gill Roberts and William Roberts] tell you?
Speaker 2: Oh, nothing specifically.  Again, we--well, by that time, we did know that the governor had called out the National Guard.  The Guard had been called out, in the governor's words, to keep the peace.  We believed him, literally.
Story_ID: 473950
Speaker 1: Prior to this, over that past summer--I wanna get back into this a little bit--did you know the other 150 students or any of those other students who dropped out for whatever reason?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know them by name at this point, but I, I knew them, certainly, because, again, we were all in the only high school [Horace Mann High School; Horace Mann Magnet Middle School] in Little Rock [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: And did you question any of them yourself, like why are you getting out of this?  Why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  That was not an issue.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: I mean it was fairly obvious that the thing was going to be pretty dangerous.  It just made good sense to drop out, really.
Speaker 1: Now, there are other things that occurred during that year, during that time period.  What were some of the other more tangible things that occurred that you can think of that happened between May and September maybe in your life or something that you can really pinpoint for us?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure what, what you're getting at here.  Everything that did happen happened (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, I guess what I would say is can you--are, were there any personal events or were you threatened by anybody?  Was there anything that went down?
Speaker 2: Oh no, nothing like that.  In fact, I remember that summer, especially, I did a lot of traveling around the South.  I wasn't in Little Rock all summer.  I went and I spent some time in, in Alabama and in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so now you, you're, you're preparing yourself for this.  Of course, I don't think anyone--maybe did, did you realize the impact--
Speaker 2: No, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at that point--
Speaker 2: Not at, not at that point.
Speaker 1: --that, that, that you--
Speaker 2: I didn't think anybody--
Speaker 1: --all were gonna have.
Speaker 2: --anybody anticipated exactly what would happen.  For instance, I knew there would be opposition.  That much was clear.  You know, living in Little Rock as a black person you figure that out, but the intensity of the opposition surprised me.  People came out in great numbers, and they said, and they did, stay there, and their goal was to outlast us.  They said we're going to stay here until you're out of this school [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].
Story_ID: 473951
Speaker 1: So what was the actual selection process they were using to weed out or to, or to wind down the, the, the numbers of people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, you know, I'm, I'm not real sure, but I can speculate that it probably had to do with things like grades, citizenship marks, records of other kinds of deportment or behavior, whatever they could use.  And like I said, the rumor was that they were gonna screen everybody out, so I would imagine they would use any criteria that they could think of.  You know, I'm reminded of the, the way they used to do black people with voting.  You know, when black people would show up to vote they'd have to pass tests, you know, and such questions as how many bubbles in a bar of soap, you know, obviously designed to weed people out.  So, the criteria would be specious.  It would just be used to block people.
Story_ID: 473952
Speaker 1: Now was there any opposition from other blacks at that time about you going to this school [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas] or even trying to be this person who would, who would go into this position?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know that there was opposition.  There was a great deal of fear, and there was a great deal of concern about economic reprisal because a lot of black people lost jobs.  It did in fact happen, and so that fear was rampant in the community of black people in Little Rock [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: So that, so that fear was expressed like possibly you should or you shouldn't do this.  You're hurting us all.  How was it expressed to you?
Speaker 2: Not directly to me, but I'm, I'm sure those must have been some of the things said. You know, I can speculate because I'm, I'm very sure there was not a hundred percent support.  I wouldn't expect that in any group.
Speaker 1: Now, were, were the churches rallied behind you all?  Was the black church instrumental--
Speaker 2: Well, some of the churches.
Speaker 1: --at this point?
Speaker 2: Some of the churches.  There was an ecumenical council, black churches and white churches.  And those churches who felt the need to support us did, and this was across racial lines.  And those who felt the need to oppose us also did across racial lines, so you had black churches and white churches who were in opposition.  One black minister said to me once, he said you know you have no business up there.  But as long as you're there, you might as well stay, which is a very interesting message.  But again, I think that was born out of fear, you see, because some black people had such tenuous positions in society, depended upon white largess.  And if things like this excited white opposition, they would be in danger of losing whatever they had.
Story_ID: 473953
Speaker 1: So television is in its infancy.  Faubus [Orval Faubus] is giving, giving decrees about what's going to happen on the next day.  So, so the day finally arrives.  Could you please tell us how that day started for you, and go into it a little bit for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I, like I said, I was in, within walking distance of Central [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  So that particular morning my mom [Margaret Gill Roberts] and dad [William Roberts] and I were watching television, and we saw the guards ringing the school.  We knew the National Guard was there.  We could see the beginnings of the mob shaping up.  But we were all pretty much convinced that the, the guardsmen would, would keep the peace, that they wouldn't allow anything to happen to me, so I walked up there alone, by myself, to discover a tremendous crowd, a roaring crowd of, of people yelling all kinds of things, talking to me specifically, obscene, profane things.  And I was surrounded by reporters and photographers.  I think in retrospect they became a real buffer zone between me and the mob, so I'm literally giving interviews, answering questions, and, and then eventually tried to get through the line of guardsmen.  They wouldn't allow it.  I didn't yet know that they were there to keep me out.  So it took (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What time of morning was this?  But--
Speaker 2: This was around eight, eight in the morning, eight o'clock.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At some point, one of the reporters said to me, "There's another black student across the street."  Across the street from where I was, Elizabeth Eckford had already come, and she was sitting on that bus bench.  And there's that famous picture of her sitting there very stoic.  I walked over and found out that she was just as scared as I was.  I said, "Why don't you come home, walk home with me?"  And she declined, saying well, "If you--when I get to your house, then I still have to get to my house, so I'll just wait for the bus."
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that's what she did.
Speaker 1: So the press--so, so the police at this point, of Little Rock [Arkansas], they had very little power.  Did they have much power as, as far as--
Speaker 2: As far as I knew, they weren't around.  They may have been somewhere on the scene.  But at Central that day, the, the national guardsmen were the people in charge (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 473954
Speaker 1: Now who was the president of, of, of our country at that point?
Speaker 2: Dwight Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower].
Speaker 1: And what was his input at that point while this is going on in Little Rock [Arkansas]?  I'm sure he's getting word of this.  Do you recall anything that was coming out from--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Eisenhower pretty much felt this was a local issue.  That it was not for the federal government to, to be involved in.  And in fact, he, he didn't act until three weeks later, when it became apparent.  I think he only acted at that point because Faubus [Orval Faubus] was rumbling about Arkansas being a, a unit in and of itself, a sovereign entity, he called it, and we don't have to obey federal law.  That got Eisenhower's attention, because this was a threat to the union, to the sanctity of the union.  So he literally federalized the National Guard, ordered them off the premises, and instructed Faubus to allow us to go to school [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas], at which point Faubus sort of threw up his, his hands in mock resignation, saying oh, okay, if you say so.  So we went to school one day under the protection of the Little Rock police, which in retrospect was the dumbest move we ever made, because we almost got killed that day.  In fact, we were only in school a few hours when we had to be spirited out in a couple of police cars because the mob was coming into the school to get us.
Speaker 1: How many days was this after your first, after the first day?
Speaker 2: This was three weeks.
Speaker 1: Three weeks later (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Three weeks later.
Speaker 1: So for three weeks this has been still going on.  How, how long--
Story_ID: 473955
Speaker 1: I mean after the day one--okay, please continue with day one for us.  You had to go to, tried to go to class.
Speaker 2: Well, then, after I'd talked to Elizabeth [Elizabeth Eckford], I walked home, and that, that was it; that was all for the one day.
Speaker 1: So, so you, so you didn't actually enter the school [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas] that day?
Speaker 2: No.  No black kids got in the school that day.
Speaker 1: On, on day one?
Speaker 2: First time we got into the school was three weeks later, when we went in under the protection of the Little Rock [Arkansas] police.
Speaker 1: So did you just stay out for those three weeks, or, or did you go to Hora- go back to--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Horace Mann [Horace Mann High School; Horace Mann Magnet Middle School, Little Rock, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: We, we stayed out.
Speaker 1: Okay, we stayed out.  So now the country's in turmoil, and, and everybody knows now because of the media what's going on, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you all are not being deemed officially the Little Rock Nine.  Are you being called that now?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite sure when that all occurred.  It was a news reporter who coined the term.  But like most things, once it gets out there into, you know, the public arena, it's there to stay.
Speaker 1: So during this three-week period in which--was there--did, did they seem to have a victory?  Those that were opposing, did, did they feel vindicated that they had possibly had a victory?  Do you, do you think that was the term?
Speaker 2: I have no idea (laughter).  I, I hope they did feel that way so those hopes could be crushed.  But, eh, just a personal thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: So three weeks later you return to the school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And was your attitude the same as it was three weeks earlier about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pretty much.
Speaker 1: --going, about going there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty much.
Speaker 1: And you enter the school.  This time you're allow to enter with, with the help of the police, correct?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the first day in classes with the teachers and what's going on now.
Speaker 2: Well, that particular day there was tension so thick you could cut it with a knife.  Fear was in the air.  Everybody was afraid.  I mean you could hear the mob surging.  You could see the policemen having trouble keeping them at bay.  And then eventually the signal was given to round up all the black kids, take them down to this basement garage.  Fortunately, there was such a thing in this school so we didn't have to go outside.  We go down there, and we go into these two police cars.  And the instructions to the drivers were accelerate only.  Don't even think about using the brake.  Get these kids home safely.  So we took off through the mob and got out.  So that was day two.
Story_ID: 473956
Speaker 1: So you go home, and you're sitting there.  You've been whisked away from your classes, out of school [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  What's going on in your mind now?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm thinking we gotta do something different.  There must be a different way to do this thing, and there was.  Eventually, Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] sent in the, the troops.
Speaker 1: Did, did any, any of the other, the other eight, did you all confer?  Was there anything else talked about, like: why are we doing this?  What are we gonna do, and what's a better plan?  Did you talk collectively about it?
Speaker 2: Nothing, nothing of that sort.  We, we did talk about the fact that looks like we're going to have to try some other strategy, yeah.
Speaker 1: So after that occurrence, Dwight Eisenhower gets involved with it?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  See, again, at this point, he's convinced that Faubus [Orval Faubus] is making these noises about Arkansas being a sovereign entity.  So he gets involved to the extent that he decides to get rid of his earlier idea about keeping hands off and orders in the 101st Airborne Division.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were, was, was there a, a decision between--of course there was a decision, but, but, but was there any interaction between the Guard [National Guard]?  Did the Guard just peacefully pick up and go and leave?  Or, or--
Speaker 2: The Guard?  No, see, no, they had been turned into federal soldiers prior to the police coming and ordered off the premises, so they had to go.  There was no question.  They were now U.S. soldiers, and they had to follow orders.
Speaker 1: So the 151st Airborne--
Speaker 2: 101st.
Speaker 1: 101st Airborne.
Speaker 2: They will never forgive you (laughter).
Speaker 1: 101st Airborne came in, and, and now they were now your, your guardians.
Speaker 2: They were.
Speaker 1: Can you explain--did, did any of them say anything to you in particular?  Did, did they encourage you to go here, or, or, or they're more mute in their--
Speaker 2: No, no.  They, they had been ordered specifically to take us to school.  So the commander, man by the name of Edwin Walker, met with us and explained their job.  They were there to see that we got into school.  And he explained how it was going to happen.  We were all going to be collected at a central point.  We were going to ride in an army vehicle with protective vehicles in front and back.  And then once we got to school, as squadron of soldiers would meet us at their automobile and would form a protective phalanx for us to walk through, and that's how we got into school.  And then a soldier was assigned to each one of us to walk down the halls from class to class.
Story_ID: 473957
Speaker 1: Now going into the school [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas], do you, do you still hear or can you recall the, the taunts and the things that were occurring at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.  That was constant, continuous, and kids would yell all kinds of things.  You know, we were called every kind of nigger they knew how to, to say.  I mean they used up all their adjectives.  In fact, I used to laugh to myself because they, they had to repeat certain things because they'd run out of adjectives, which didn't get them, gain them any points with me for creativity.
Speaker 1: So you're in school, and there's school faculty; there's teachers there; there's principals there, people that are in charge of the school, the administration.  What were their comments, or what were their attitudes to you all while you were there?
Speaker 2: Well, again, see, you have a group of people, and it is virtually impossible to identify them as being of one mind, okay, so there was a continuum as I see it.  There were those who were absolutely opposed to our presence there; there were those who were fence riders; and there were some few who were actively supportive.  So out of that group though, the stronger voices were those who were opposed.  They tended to drown out the other voices.  And they, the ones who were very opposed also used social sanctions to get their way.  So even if the fence riders or the supporters wanted to do something, they had to face their neighbors, their friends, their relatives at times, who were adamantly opposed, and it was hard to go against that social tide.  So, we had to deal with that.  Fear was also present.  Everybody was afraid, including the teachers.
Speaker 1: Fear for your actual life?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, yeah, I'd like to get some examples of, of what, of what they, of what they may have done, or how did they--I mean what did they do in a classroom setting to show that they were definitely opposed to you being there?
Speaker 2: Well, I suppose my, my English teacher would be the best example of that.  She would be the chief antagonist.  She said to me one day, "Why do you want to come to our school?"
Speaker 1: Did you recall her name?
Speaker 2: I don't know her name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't remember it.  But she said, "Why do you want to come to our school?  Why don't you go back to your own school [Horace Mann High School; Horace Mann Magnet Middle School, Little Rock, Arkansas]?"  Which I thought was an odd question from an educator.  I mean she knew I think at some point that you could not actually divide up schools based on racial group ownership, just wasn't possible.  But any rate, then on, on another occasion in her class, I took up a handful of can openers, those beer can openers with the sharp edges that kids had thrown at me, five or six of them.  And I said you know, "These were thrown at me."  She said, "Well, I didn't see it."  Then she said something very odd.  She said, "Did you bring those in?" You know, accusing me of planting the things.  Now, on the other extreme, there was my algebra teacher, who was one of the supportive people.  And she actually made an announcement on day one when I showed up that there would be absolutely no harassment of me in the classroom, so that set the tone in that classroom.
Story_ID: 473958
Speaker 1: Was your private--well I won't call it your private guard, but, was the guard that was assigned to you, was he harassed in the class by the other, by the--
Speaker 2: Well, he--the guards couldn't come into the class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had to stand outside, and of course, they were harassed also.  But they were chain- trained soldiers, and they knew they didn't have to respond.
Speaker 1: So we have the, we have the continuum, as you said, of, of administrative personnel having their differences of opinion, be it opposed or for.  But now you're also in a classroom setting with other students.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you give me some insight on that experience, like, this--in that same English class, for instance, or any of your other classes, sitting next to someone or get--taking your seat?  Could you give us some examples of--
Speaker 2: Well, on the--when we were finally able to actually start going to school [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas]--this is with the [U.S.] Army; that I considered the real first day of school--every class I walked into several white students got up and left.  That was their very bold statement.  And basically, they didn't leave it at that, just their walking out.  They also added the verbiage, which was to let me know that they weren't gonna stay there in school with me, and as long as I was there, they would be absent.  So I thought, even then, it was fairly odd that a student who would sacrifice his or her own opportunity to educate him or herself in the name of segregation, that was very odd, but they left.  Those who stayed, many of them grumbled all the time consistently, and they would begin to harass us, do things, pick at us.  And their goal was to make life so miserable that we would want to leave.
Speaker 1: Can you give us some brief examples of some of those outside of the taunting, verbal taunting, few of the things they may have done or--
Speaker 2: Well, two things to say about that: anything that you can think of that one human being might do to another in a negative way, they did to us.  They hit, they kicked, they spit, they pinched, they cursed, and they slapped, they scratched, they threw acid, they threw flaming balls of toilet paper, you know, whatever they could think of doing.  They put tacks on the seat; they put broken glass on the shower floor. And I got hit one day with a combination lock so hard it almost knocked me out.  That was the sort of stuff you had to deal with.  And then I could never keep any supplies.  All of my books or notebooks were destroyed on the spot, pencils broken.  So, more often than not, I was in class with no books and no notebooks.
Speaker 1: How long did this go on for you?
Speaker 2: For one year.
Speaker 1: For one year.
Story_ID: 473959
Speaker 1: Now, at the same time that this was happening, was, was there any retaliation out of, from you all?  Was there any direct retaliation?
Speaker 2: You know, we, we chose to be nonviolent.  Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], in the company of Jim Lawson [James Lawson] and Glen Smiley [Glenn E. Smiley], came to Little Rock [Arkansas].  Lawson and Smiley were real proponents of nonviolence, and they were in fact helping Dr. King sort of refine his approach.  And they talked to us about nonviolence, and advocated nonviolence, and suggested that it would be good for us to adopt that as a strategy.  And after some consideration, we agreed.  Interestingly enough, Dr. King said to us, "I know it seems like this is something that you want to do, and I would love for you to do it."  But he said, "You know, unless you can truthfully say that you love your enemy, it won't work."  So then we had to ponder that one, and eventually we all nine said yeah, we, we can do that.  We do love our enemies, so it was easy--well, wasn't easy.  I'll change that.  But we, we felt like this made sense, you know.
Speaker 1: There was a chili bowl incident, bowl of chili (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And you--can you elaborate on it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was Minnijean Brown [Minnijean Brown Trickey].  Minni came under heavy fire, as did we all.  But then one day, she'd gotten to a point--it's like that old proverbial straw and the camel's back.  She was in the cafeteria, and some kid, smaller than Minni, little man--a boy--pushed his chair back just as she was about to pass behind him.  He pushed his chair back to block her progress.  So there she was headed to her table, but she couldn't get by.  And so she stood there for a long moment wondering what to do.  Finally, she just upended that tray of food on him, including a bowl of chili.  Then the next day, I think it was a bowl of soup that somebody poured on her head.  And from that point on, it was Minni against the mob, because she began to fight, and the school administrators decided to kick her out.  So in February of '58 [1958] she was expelled [from Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  For her own safety and well-being was the official jargon.
Story_ID: 473960
Speaker 1: So this is your first year of, of, of the nine.  Everybody's there [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas], and you're going through this procedure of every day wondering, wondering are your books gonna be there, your pencils, your, your supplies; there's taunting; there's all kinds of undercurrent from the teachers, the administration.  Were you learning anything at that point?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, survival 101 (laughter), how to survive (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Please elaborate.
Speaker 2: --under very hostile circumstances.
Speaker 1: So it, it wasn't necessarily academic that you were learning.  You were learning--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the, the year was so chaotic, you have to understand that the emphasis wasn't really on academics.  And, and besides that, at that point, we were all such good students that high school academics were not that hard, I mean to be honest about it.  It wasn't something that you had to spend long nights pondering over, you know.  And so that part you could do very quickly, get the academics done, and we were motivated, highly motivated to do that.  And so the real energy could be put into learning how to get through the day and live.
Speaker 1: Now we're though, we're gonna take a small break.  When you come back, you, you mentioned the meeting of, the meeting with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Lawson [James Lawson].  I'd like to talk about that a bit more, when that was; and what happened with that meeting; and, and were you able to correspond and have a verbiage back with them, communication with, with them; did you actually meet Dr. King and talk to him, and, and what that was like, and what that was about.  And we'll go back further in, 'cause now we're gonna go into your senior year coming up, coming up--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --coming up, and we'll go into that.  And now you're pondering college, getting ready to go somewhere else in the school.  So we'll talk about that in a moment.
Story_ID: 473961
Speaker 1: Now we're here, and you're in school, and there's a lot going on now at Central [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  The world knows about it pretty much now because of media exposure.  And Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and his crew come down to talk to you about what you all should do or to be supportive of you all.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do, do you recall that meeting?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We, we met at the home of Daisy Bates.  Daisy was the Arkansas state president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  She, at that point, had assumed a mantle of leadership because the school board was falling apart under intense pressure from the citizens.  They were, in fact, beginning to rethink their whole decision.
Speaker 1: Who was on the school board at this time?  Do you recall?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  You know, these, these were just members of the white community (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Daisy Bates' home was sort of a gathering spot.  So it was there that Martin Luther King came, along with Jim Lawson [James Lawson] and Glen Smiley [Glenn E. Smiley], and that's where we sat and talked about nonviolence as a potential tactic that we could adopt.  And we listened to the explanation, and we understood.  Now, after many years of my own reading about Dr. King's revelation in terms of nonviolence, it all fits, because I could see where he was then and where he got to later following that same pathway.
Speaker 1: Approximately what year in time--this was fifty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was all in '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957], and this was somewhere--
Speaker 2: Just prior, before, before school started.
Speaker 1: Okay, just before September.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they, so, so they were there before all of this really jumped off.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And they were trying to give you the heads-up, so to speak.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have a dialogue with him yourself, with Dr. King himself?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well all nine of us were in the dialogue together.
Speaker 1: And do you remember anything outside of, you know, being ready to really love your neighbor?  Do you recall anything else that was said to you in particular or the group in particular?
Speaker 2: Well, just the, the basic tenets of nonviolence.  We were told, for instance, that nonviolence is not a passive activity.  You're not just there to absorb and, and, and absorb like a, you know, a, a blump--a, a lump or a log but that you actively try to engage your opponent through nonverbal, through visual contacts, that you try and establish some human link, you know, between you and the oppressor.  That was very powerful, because you can do a lot with eye contact, you know.  So we, we discovered, for instance, that not only could, could we do it, after a time, but that we became somewhat good at it.
Story_ID: 473962
Speaker 1: Now you're in school [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  Things are going on.  It's a lot, a lot of negativity, so to speak, occurring.  You go home into your neighborhood, in your community, in your area, your own siblings, what were some of those conversations, and what were some of those things that were said, or what was the feeling and pulse when you left the school and went home?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the basic feeling for me was one of instant relief.  So once I got out of the confines of the school with all of that crazy stuff going on, I could relax.  I could release some of the tension.  And, and home was a good place to be at that point, because at home I didn't have to answer any questions.  I didn't have to give account of myself in any way.  If I wanted to talk about the day, I could; if I didn't, fine, you know, and that was wonderful.
Speaker 1: And your parents [Margaret Gill Roberts and William Roberts], what, what were, what were their comments and their feelings to you or comments to you at that point?
Speaker 2: You know, basically they were extremely supportive, both my mom and dad.  They knew without my having to tell them that I was going through a, a lot.  I mean they, they could see it probably on my face, the tension on my face.  They did not exacerbate the situation by bringing it up, you know.  They, they allowed me to, to be comfortable in the setting with them and with my siblings to take in all of their supportive behavior and use that.  So our conversations at home were, were basically centered around things that mattered in our home life.
Story_ID: 473963
Speaker 1: Now, that year, after that year, did it, did all the schools become, become integrated at that point after that?
Speaker 2: At the end of that school year, the governor of Arkansas, Orval Faubus, closed every high school.  Every public high school was closed in the name of segregation.  His basic idea was that if he couldn't have a segregated school system, he didn't need one.  So that meant that anybody in Little Rock [Arkansas] who depended upon public high schools for education were out of luck.  Now as a consequence of the schools' closure, and they remained closed for that whole year, I left Little Rock and went to live with relatives in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: So, Governor Faubus closed the whole school system down.
Speaker 2: All the high schools in Little Rock.
Speaker 1: So high school students of both ra- both races had nowhere to go to school--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --unless they could afford, afford private, private education (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, if they go to private schools or leave town to go to other public schools elsewhere.
Speaker 1: So at that point you did what again now?
Speaker 2: I left Little Rock for Los Angeles and moved in with my dad's sister and her husband and enrolled in Los Angeles High School [Los Angeles, California] where I spent my senior year.
Speaker 1: What school was that that you--
Speaker 2: Los Angeles High.
Speaker 1: Oh, Los Angeles High.  And were you popular and famous at that point?
Speaker 2: I came in under the radar.  Nobody really knew me.  I was a new kid in town.  And I was able to be in that school for several weeks before anybody knew about my past.
Speaker 1: Was this decision, your parents' [Margaret Gill Roberts and William Roberts] decision, because of glove- of Governor Faubus closing the schools down?  Was it also that the decision that they know you had to finish your education, so was this their decision?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, yeah, it was a joint, joint decision.  There was no way I was gonna stay out of school for a year.  And I had this option, which is important because see, a lot of kids didn't have the option of leaving.  A lot of kids simply dropped out of school that year and never got back.
Speaker 1: How about the other eight in the, in the class, in your class?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did they do that year?
Speaker 2: --Ernie [HistoryMaker Ernest Green] had graduated.  I mean--
Speaker 1: He was a senior.
Speaker 2: --he didn't have to go to high school.  Those of us who were juniors all made other plans for the senior year, and we finished high school in various places around the country.  Two of the kids who had been tenth graders actually returned to Central [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas] the year the school reopened, which was the year '59 [1959], '60 [1960].  So Carlotta [HistoryMaker Carlotta Walls LaNier] and Jeff [Jefferson Thomas] came back and graduated from Central.
Speaker 1: So they had a year out, and then they just went back when the schools reopened (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, they, they, they actually went elsewhere for their eleventh grade.
Story_ID: 473964
Speaker 1: Now you, you've come from Little Rock [Arkansas] now, and you've been under the last year, we'll call it a very stressful year for you.  You're now in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] with, with relatives going to Los Angeles High School [Los Angeles, California].  Can you give me the, your impressions, your first impress--well, was this your first time visiting L.A.?  Was this your first time--
Speaker 2: This was my first visit to L.A., right.
Speaker 1: So it's a whole new culture, so to speak, for you, a West Coast culture.  Did it seem different to you at that point?
Speaker 2: Not in a major sense, no.  I mean I knew enough about L.A., because, as I said, my relatives had been here since the early '40s [1940s].  And they often visited Little Rock, so I knew a lot about life in L.A.
Speaker 1: Did you feel the same tension of racism in Los Angeles as you did in Little Rock, or did you see it different, or how did you feel at--
Speaker 2: Oh no.  The, the racial tension was here.  And so that was also important because that, that was no real change.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but the education at Los Angeles High School, was it a little easier as far as your education is concerned?  Was it more accepted for you to be there?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  In fact, L.A. High was probably the most truly integrated school I've ever attended.  It was during a time--this was the year '58 [1958], '59 [1959]--where the neighborhood around L.A. High was one where all manner of people lived in close proximity to each other.  Of course, now when you look at that particular area, it's, it's very distinctively defined by racial groups, but then it wasn't.  It was just a combination of all kinds of people living together.
Story_ID: 473965
Speaker 1: So you're in your senior year [at Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California].  At this point, did you have aspirations of college?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, of course.  I mean that, that was always a given, that that would be just the next step in the educational sequence.
Speaker 1: How about aspirations of what, what you wanted to be?  Were you more defining what it--were, were you more defined now with, with what you wanted to do with your life?
Speaker 2: No, no.  In fact, I started off college--I was at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]--as a chemistry major, which was exciting and fascinating for me.
Speaker 1: What year was that gonna be in now?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959], okay.  And you're a chemistry major at UCLA.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, please tell us more about that experience.
Speaker 2: Well, that turned out to be quite an interesting experience because the summer of that year I decided I would go to summer school, which I, I'd never gone to summer school.  And so I thought, well, okay, I'll, I'll give this a shot.  So I took a course in sociology, and I was fascinated.  Then I began to have some ideas about what I might do.  I thought I would become a sociologist, become a university professor and do research in the community.  Now, and the goal, by choosing that, the goal would be to find out ways to improve life for poor people, especially poor black people in this country.  But those ideas got derailed along the way because I found out that sociologists weren't really doing that, you know.  They were collecting data from communities, but they weren't doing anything particularly to improve the community.  They were taking the data out and analyzing it, and writing reports, and writing books, and achieving fame and fortune as great sociologists.  But they, they weren't really being helpful.
Story_ID: 473966
Speaker 1: So you're a freshman in chemistry now, at--coming in UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] your freshman year.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you have a chemistry major.  Were you known to be one, one of the Little Rock Nine on campus?
Speaker 2: Yes. Uh-huh. There were, you know, opportunities for me to be presented to the school community via the student newspaper and interviews, L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times], local TV, that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: And did you make any acquaintances or friendships or anything that, that really were, were standout to you at that point that, that still carry you through to this day?  Was anybody, any, any professors or anything in that freshman year that really stands out to you now?
Speaker 2: Well, I was frightened a lot in Chem 101 by Elton Trueblood [sic. Kenneth N. Trueblood], who was a chemistry professor.  He opened the first lecture with a conset- with a comment that--I think his number was over 50 percent of freshmen would fail his chemistry class.  That was pretty frightening (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and did you fail it?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't fail it.  But I didn't do as well as I should have done.  I got through it, but at that, you know, at that same time I was discovering other talents.  For instance, I, I had found out I had a knack for writing in an English class.  I didn't have to take what was called the beginning English class because I scored high enough on the test.  So I had English 101, and I found out that wow, okay.  So I was beginning to discover other things about myself.
Speaker 1: And did you discover that, discover that you had some activist, activist in you?  And, and did you do anything on campus that, that was more in the activist way, social activist?  Did you join any organizations or become part of anything (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  I actually was reluctant to join organizations always, you know.  In fact, joining the Little Rock Nine I didn't see as joining an organization.  That, that was just sort of an appellation put on us by some newsman.  But organizations to me never had much appeal, so.  In fact, when I was at L.A. High [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California], I was struck by the fact that even though this was a very well integrated school, students used to self-segregate, and I thought that was odd.  So when you look at the yearbook from my high school senior year, you'll find my face showing up in all kinds of places, usually the only black face among a sea of other people.  But same thing carried on at UCLA; I sort of found my own way.  Organizations seem to be committed to ideas that were somehow stifling growth, you know.  They seem to have had, had sense that this is the way to go.  I never have felt that.  I've always known that there was, there's always more than one way to do whatever.
Story_ID: 473967
Speaker 1: So you're a freshman [at University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] in chemistry, and you're, you're finding your own way, as you just put it.  Now, what was the cause to make you change your major in the years to come?
Speaker 2: Well, it was mainly that summer school class in sociology.  I began to follow up this interest in understanding people and what made them choose whatever pathway in life they decided to choose.  And after sociology had proved to be sort of a, a bomb-out, I changed, I actually changed my major to sociology.  And once I got the degree in sociology I wasn't satisfied, so I actually then went into a graduate program in, in social work.
Speaker 1: When did you get your, your change from chemistry to sociology at UCLA? Which, which standing point--
Speaker 2: The second year.
Speaker 1: So in your sophomore year you changed to sociology.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 473968
Speaker 1: And during the next three years did you, did you do anything else activist-wise, just on your own?  Did you, did you do anymore, anymore activities regarding what happened to you, or did you do anything else while you were in school in regards to that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You mean like desegregating a high school (laughter).
Speaker 1: Or, or, or just being a speaker, you know, and, and going around lecturing?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  I was just mainly focused on, on being a student.
Speaker 1: And your parents [Margaret Gill Roberts and William Roberts] were still back in Arkansas at this point.
Speaker 2: No, no.  By that time my entire family moved to L.A. [Los Angeles, California]
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: So I came out here in September or August of '58 [1958], and by December of that same year my entire family relocated.
Speaker 1: Was there--was this because you're here or because they just had enough of Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Both (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was there job opportunities?
Speaker 2: I think both, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 473969
Speaker 1: So now you're into your senior year.  You, you're gonna graduate with a degree in psychol- sociology from UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: No.  By that time I had switched schools.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: In the third year I switched over to Cal State L.A. [Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] I had a couple of buddies who were in the program over there in sociology, and I decided to join them, John Oliver and Harry Truly. These were two guys that I hung out with.  So we all were pursuing degrees in sociology.
Speaker 1: This was around 1962 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think I got--
Speaker 1: --sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 2: --my, my degree actually in '67 [1967].
Story_ID: 473970
Speaker 1: So now you have a degree in sociology, and you see--are you seeing the world?  Now at--during that time period there was a lot of things that were occurring while you were in college.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There were, there was the, John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] had been assassinated, Malcolm X.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There were several things that occurred while you were in college.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And as you were a sociologist or going into your sociology studies, did any of these, these things really weigh heavy on you deciding yes, this is what I'm going to do because I need to--
Speaker 2: Well, not in that sense.  I was certainly keenly aware of all of those dynamics going on.  But my focus was primarily on, again, that same trying to figure out what drives people to do what they do, you know, what would drive a person to kill a JFK or a Malcolm X, you know, that sort of thing, pondering those questions.
Speaker 1: And do you recall, since we're sit--we're on this time period, since you got your degree in sociology in '67 [1967], so '68 [1968], April the 4th was, was the assassination of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  What were your during--doing during that time period (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At that time I was in grad school.  I was in the social work program.  I went back to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and was in the graduate program in social work there.  So that's when I learned about his assassination.
Speaker 1: And how'd that affect you?
Speaker 2: It was a time of sadness for me because it seemed--he seemed to represent a real hope for this country, turn things in new directions, and his life was snuffed out.  And again, it wasn't unexpected, you know.  Any time in this country when you begin to preach a gospel that is not consistent with maintaining the status quo you're vulnerable.  You just might be taken out, and so he was.
Story_ID: 473971
Speaker 1: So now you're, now you have your undergrad in sociology, and you're working on your, on your master's [degree]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --now.  You're back at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] now working on your master's, and you receive that in 1970.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're a twenty-nine year old man, soon to be thirty, I would, I would imagine.  And what does life have to offer for you at this point now?
Speaker 2: Well, actually at the end of my graduate school studies in social work, I actually worked for the County of L.A. [Los Angeles County, California] in child welfare, and that was an eye-opening experience.  I got to see upfront and up close how terrible life is for kids who have no advocates.  I had a caseload of kids who were in foster homes, their real families, who knows where they were, and it was overwhelming.  I worked for two years, couldn't figure out any answers.  It was very frustrating really.  But during that time, during that two-year period that I worked, I got a phone call from a former professor of mine from UCLA in the social work program, who by that time had moved to Southern Illinois University [Carbondale, Illinois].  And he was running a program in social work for undergraduates, and he called me and asked if I would join the faculty.  And when that occurred, lights came on for me.  I said oh, okay, but I'll make a deal.  I'll join your faculty if I can also be a graduate student at the same time.  So we worked that out, and that's when I got into the psychology program at Southern Illinois University.
Speaker 1: And at that time, were you married or were you--
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, my wife [Rita Anderson] and, and two daughters [Angela Roberts and Rebecca Roberts Goodloe], we all went to Southern Illinois together.
Speaker 1: So what year, year did you get married?
Speaker 2: In '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: In '61 [1961], so you were in your, maybe your junior year at, at Cal State [Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your daughters came along how many years after that?
Speaker 2: My eldest child was born a year later, '62 [1962], and then the other one in '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you all are--you've been working for the county for two years in the child welfare department, and, and you saw a lot there.  Now, because you had both of your parents [Margaret Gill Roberts and William Roberts] in your life, so, so you really felt some empathy for these, for these (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --these children.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I thought, you know, this unfair.  You know, kids are extremely vulnerable.  They had no one to speak for them, and they were at the mercy of the system, and, and the system is just not the right choice to raise kids.
Speaker 1: So now were these kids of all races?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Especially here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] I would imagine (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 473972
Speaker 1: You get the call from your, from your old professor, and he wants you to come and join him in Southern Illinois [Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois].  And your wife [Rita Anderson] and you pack up.  Everybody's good to go, and you leave.  So now, between '76 [1976], what happened when you got to Southern Illinois?
Speaker 2: Well, one thing we did, we, we bought a house, because it seemed practical and feasible and possible.  When you make the shift from the West Coast to places like Carbondale, Illinois, you are shocked that the houses are so cheap.  And so we could afford to buy a house, and, and we did.  We got there on a Sunday, picked up a Sunday paper, put a circle around the house we thought we wanted.  On Monday we and made an offer and bought it.  I enrolled in school and put the kids [Angela Roberts and Rebecca Roberts Goodloe] in school, and we were off and running.
Speaker 1: So how long were you there?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Three years.  And were you known as, as the prof who was also part of, part of the Little Rock Nine or, or what--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, at some point, you know, that, that became part of my identity.
Speaker 1: And you got your Ph.D. there.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now you've gotten your Ph.D. in 1976.
Speaker 2: Seventy-six [1976].
Story_ID: 473973
Speaker 1: So now at this point you, you've achieved great educational attainment.  Now what is the next step for--
Speaker 2: Well, a--
Speaker 1: --for Dr. Roberts [HistoryMaker Terrence Roberts] at this point?
Speaker 2: Immediately after the degree in psychology, I took a job running a mental health program in a small hospital in Northern California, a little hospital called St. Helena Hospital and Health Center [St. Helena Hospital Napa Valley] in Deer Park, California, and spent the next ten years there.
Speaker 1: In the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we see that you were there, and, and now you, you were the head administrator of this, this organization?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Of the psychology department?
Speaker 2: Well, actually it was director of mental health.
Speaker 1: And as you did that, you did that for ten years.
Story_ID: 473974
Speaker 1: There were some things that occurred while you were there.  I see that you were, you actually got a chance to have a conversation or, or--Orval Faubus on television.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  We were both invited to appear on 'Good Morning America.'
Speaker 1: Why, why was this a topic in 1979?
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly what prompted that one, but one of the things about Little Rock [Arkansas] is that it has legs (laughter).  It always has some value in terms of communicating and dialogue.  So I think the producers of that show--let's see, '79 [1979] from '57 [1957], what is that?  Thirty--twenty-four years?  Yeah twenty-four years.  Maybe it was because it was nearing twenty-five years.  I don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wow.
Speaker 2: But anyway, there we were.
Speaker 1: So here you are, a well-educated, in spite of it all individual in front of the man that actually tried to deny you all the rights that you've achieved.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, it's interesting.  The producer was a little skittish about the two of us being together, so he put us up at the same hotel on different floors.  And the very next morning, for the trip to the studio he sent two limos, one for Faubus, one for me.  And I said to him, "You know, you could have saved money, and I would have had a chance to talk to this guy.  What, what were you thinking?"  He said, "Well, I wasn't sure."  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How, how old was he at this point?
Speaker 2: Faubus?  I have no idea.  But I did get to talk to him at the studio.  We had a chance backstage, and I confronted him and told him, you know, he, through his actions, could have been instrumental in my being killed, you know, and the other eight of us as well.  I, I said to him, you know, we were very vulnerable, at risk.  What were you thinking?  He said well, you know, if I hadn't done that, then I would have been voted out of office, and somebody worse than me might have been elected.  And that was historic.  And like the old country music (laughter) song, that was his story, and he was sticking to it.  He said it again at the Eisenhower Library [Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum] over in Abilene, Kansas.  We were doing an oral history project.  And that was the same thing he said in response to that same question, you know, what were you thinking?
Speaker 1: How did you feel standing there in front of him?  What was going on inside of you at that point when you were there actually--you have a, you have a national audience to--and so you have that, that pressure of people watching you.  But also, how did you personally feel knowing that we were all watching something that we really didn't live?  You actually lived this, but you still have feelings and emotions.  How did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --you feel?
Speaker 2: --I don't know.  My main goal was to see if I could engage this man, this Faubus, in some sort of meaningful dialogue; turned out not to be the case, you know.  He, he didn't seem to have enough wherewithal to even talk about it in terms that made sense to me, you know.  For him to say he had to do it because he would have been voted out of office, it--well, perhaps had meaning for him, you know, as, as a political person, but it seemed strangely insufficient, you know, for me.
Speaker 1: So you don't feel there was any real apology?
Speaker 2: I don't think he would ever apologize, no.  I didn't expect that.
Speaker 1: So, so was it, was, was the show a, a debate or was it, was, was the segment a debate between the two of you?
Speaker 2: No, but interesting enough, they, these 'Good Morning America' program is for seven minutes per segment.  And once we had our little exchange, the producer says up, gotta go another seven, so we bumped somebody.  We bumped a woman who had been scheduled to talk about her dreams.  And she was irate because she had alerted all of her friends and buddies around the country to watch her, and she wasn't going on.  So that was, that was more drama than Faubus.
Speaker 1: So you all did the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did another segment.
Speaker 1: So you did like fourteen minutes.
Speaker 2: We did fourteen minutes.
Speaker 1: And then you just left, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And once it was over, we went our separate ways.
Story_ID: 473975
Speaker 1: After this point, had you been receiving--you know, we're, we're going now to a point where we're not really emailing much yet.  But I--did, did, did you receive any, any letters or, or anything from anybody ever that was part of that to the negative apologizing to you ever?  Did you ever get anything from anybody?
Speaker 2: Nothing, nothing in writing.  I did, years later, meet with one of the white students who had been there who apologized, Hazel Bryan [Hazel Bryan Massery].  Hazel apologized, and she said--her own self-description was she was the poster child for American racism.  She was solely imbued with those notions of white superiority that she felt it was her duty to push us out of the school, so she tried.  But then as an adult person, she was sorry for that.  And so genuinely she came to me, and we had a talk about it.
Story_ID: 473976
Speaker 1: So that would happen in 1979.  You're thirty-eight years old.  You're going toward we call the forty mark.  And what's going on with you now as far as your family and your, and your own career at this point?
Speaker 2: At age forty?  Where am I?  This would be '81 [1981].  Oh, okay, so from '75 [1975] to '85 [1985], that was a year I was at the, directing the mental health program [at St. Helena Hospital and Health Center; St. Helena Hospital Napa Valley, Deer Park, California].  So, there--I was in the Napa Valley [California], and actually life was very nice.  I, I loved living up there, and the work I was doing was satisfying.
Speaker 1: And that work was, once again, being in community mental health, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was several things.  You know, as director of mental health, I had responsibility of making sure that the patients in that unit got excellent care, so basically, I had to monitor the staff.  I had a staff of psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses and an ancillary helpers.  And then my approach to something like that is to always hire the best people possible so that my work is done.  Then I just have to make sure they have proper working conditions.  And then I spent a lot of time doing problem-solving throughout the whole hospital.  That was the real joy I had.
Speaker 1: So as you were, as you're going through this particular position--you like this job in your life--were you starting to even view racism as somewhat as a mental condition?  Sometimes did you start to see parallels or a thing that you could use to say well, maybe these people, because of conditioning or whatever, might be somewhat--you know, did you start to see it in different lights, or did you, did you just see it as pure hatefulness?
Speaker 2: Didn't see it in either one of those lights.  I, I saw it as choice, and I still see it as choice.  People choose how they want to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, when we come back we're gonna go through--we see that you have become the, the chair of the psychology department at Antioch [Antioch University Los Angeles, Culver City, California].  And we're gonna come up through--that's about '94 [1994].  We're gonna come through there and come forward then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 473977
Speaker 1: Okay, it's '94 [1994], and you become the chair of the psychology department in Antioch University in L.A. [Antioch University Los Angeles, Culver City, California].  Can you tell me how that came about from, from, from the Napa Valley [California]?  How did you get from Napa Valley?
Speaker 2: Well, there's an interim spot.  From '75 [1975] to '85 [1985], I was there in St. Helena [sic.], at the hospital [St. Helena Hospital and Health Center; St. Helena Hospital Napa Valley, Deer Park, California].  Then I actually came back to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] as an administrator in the school of social work.  And from '85 [1985] to '93 [1993], I was the assistant dean in that school.  Then I retired; I retired from UCLA.  And because I was still relatively young, I decided to look around for something else to do.  I found this ad for a department chair in psychology in Antioch.  That intrigued me because ordinarily you, you got your department chair from within the ranks; people move up.  So I'm thinking they're looking outside for a department chair, there must be a problem here, must be something going that people are afraid to face.  And I proved to be right.  When I got there, after I'd taken the job, I discovered there was a seventeen-year old problem that had been place, and people were afraid to tackle it.  It involved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was it?
Speaker 2: It involved a professor who was doing things he shouldn't be doing.  And nobody told me this.  I discovered it myself, and then I immediately confronted the guy and told him he had to cease and desist.  And he agreed with me.  This was on a Monday.  However, on Tuesday, he was fuming; he was angry, and he resigned.  So then eventually that meant the problem was resolved very quickly.  So I spent the next few years being the department chair.  But after time, I actually got weary of doing all of the administrative work, so I became co-chair.  I, I don't remember the years, but I've been there now a total of fourteen years.  So I would imagine about year seven or eight, I became a co-chair.  And then about year ten or eleven, I gave up all of those responsibilities, and now I remain on faculty but without any undue administrative responsibilities.  I still have a few things I do but nothing like being the chair.
Speaker 1: So now basically it's, it's lecturing a few lectures--
Speaker 2: Lecturing and I run something called the MPIC, which is the master's program independent concentration [Master of Arts in Psychology with Individualized Concentration] for those students who opt not to get a clinical degree but who want to study psychology with a particular focus.  I run that program.
Story_ID: 473978
Speaker 1: Now, there's some highlights thing I'd like to talk about, one being that, that you were on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.'
Speaker 2: Yes, I think it was in '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: Ninety-six [1996] maybe.
Speaker 2: It was '96 [1996]?  Okay.  Yeah, Oprah's [Oprah Winfrey] people, quote, called me and asked if I would be on the show.  And I listened to what they had to say.  And the young lady who called me was concerned that I didn't seem excited.  And she said, "Aren't you excited to be on 'Oprah'?"  I said, "Well, could you, could you tell me a little bit about the show?"  I'd never seen it at that point.  I must have been one of few people in the world who had never seen 'Oprah.'  So I went on.  It was okay.  It was, it was good.
Speaker 1: Now, now, was that also, were that--that was the whole group?  You all went on with--
Speaker 2: No, no.  I think there were only five or six of the nine of us, and then there were several of our antagonists, former white students at Central [Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas] who had been beating up on us.  They were on the show to apologize, say that we're sorry.  But the funny thing, I didn't believe them, because prior to 'Oprah,' I'd not heard from them, and since 'Oprah,' I've not heard from them.  So I figure it was all made for television.
Speaker 1: So what was that experience like that day on the show though, and Oprah there and--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was all fascinating, watching Oprah operate.  You know, what they do there at Harpo Studios [Harpo Productions, Inc.] is, she actually films or records several shows in one day in different studios.  I think they have three studios, so there's a lot of activity, and just watching all of that was fascinating.
Speaker 1: And were there any exchanges with you personally, one on one, with any of those past antagonists?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We're milling around.  One of them said to me--I've forgotten their names, but he said, "You know, you have to remember we were just teenagers."  And I thought to myself, well, what does that mean?  Yeah, we were teenagers, but you were beating me up (laughter).  I wasn't beating you up.  Somehow that was a very feeble excuse I thought.
Story_ID: 473979
Speaker 1: In '98 [1998], in 1998, another large thing happens for you.  You become the official desegregation consultant for the Little Rock School District.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  That was an interesting thing.  You know, Little Rock School System, they weren't serious.   They were under court order to desegregate.  And they needed some good PR, so I'm pretty sure they hired me for public relations purposes.  They wanted to dangle me out in front of the public and say, you know, we're really good guys.  After all, we hired Terry Roberts [HistoryMaker Terrence Roberts].  I understood that dynamic, but I took the job anyway, with the intent of engaging in guerrilla warfare once I got there.  So once I got into that system, then I began to poke around and do things.  And one of the early things I did was I asked the superintendent of schools, guy by the name of Les Carnine [Leslie Carnine], I said, "Could I have a complete list of all the known bigots in the system?  I think I need to start with them."  He wouldn't give me the list.  But later on I figured out, he'd have to put his name at the top of the list.  But I also proposed a program of training for every person in the district, including the superintendent.  It was a program of self-growth.  It was to be six months in duration, and it was mandatory.  And I worked it all out, and I submitted it.  But I heard absolutely nothing from the school district for a long time, maybe nine months.  By the end of nine months, I got myself a spot on the school board meeting agenda.  They have meetings on Thursday night, and these meetings are televised over local cable.  I knew all of this.  So, my proposed subject was an update of my consultative activities.  So that's what I did: I gave an update.  And at the end of that report, I mentioned the fact that I had submitted this proposal for a training program, but I'd heard nothing.  Then I sat down.  By the time I got back to my hotel room, the phone was ringing off the hook, school officials indignant, wanting to know why I called them out on TV.  Because I knew that all these people would be watching, and they'd be curious: why are you not responding to Roberts' proposal?  What's going on here?  So, then, the heat was on, and they pulled that proposal off the shelf, and we finally implemented it.  We probably ran five or six hundred people through the program before I got fired.
Speaker 1: So this is 1998, and they're still, in Little Rock [Arkansas] they're still having issues with--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I was there for four years, '98 [1998] to 2002.
Speaker 1: So, so, so you actually moved back, or you just were there consulting from here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went--yeah, I drove--I mean I flew down once a month, spent about a week at a time and worked that way.
Story_ID: 473980
Speaker 1: Now a really big event happened in 1999.  President Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] gave, gave you the nation's highest civilian award.  What was that award?
Speaker 2: That was the Congressional Gold Medal.  And all nine of us received a gold medal and a ceremony at the White House [Washington, D.C.], which was interesting because ordinarily the ceremony would have take- taken place in [U.S.] Congress.  But because Bill Clinton was president, and he had a special interest, since this was from Arkansas, they all agreed to hold the ceremony at the White House.
Speaker 1: Did you have any conversation one on one with Bill Clinton?  Did he talk to you at all?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  In fact, he talked specifically to, to each one of us as a member of the nine, and we all did photo ops with him and our families.
Speaker 1: Do you recall your conversation?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and you have that medal now.  So every--all the nine, nine members have that medal?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 473981
Speaker 1: So what's your current aspiration right now?  What are you currently doing outside of, outside of being the chair, co-chair, or, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --being on faculty [of Antioch University Los Angeles, Culver City, California]?
Speaker 2: --right now, I am, I'm anticipating life after formal employment, what I will continue to do.  I have written a manuscript, a proposed book with a working title of 'Lessons from Little Rock' [Terrence Roberts].  That manuscript is now in the hand of an agent, who's taking it around to publishers.  Hopefully it'll be published very soon.  My wife [Rita Anderson] and I plan to do some writing together.  So our joint plan, as we both sort of wind down from these formal employment situations, is to spend time writing and lecturing.
Story_ID: 473982
Speaker 1: Now you've had a lot of the time over the years to develop your sense of mind and sense of behavior.  You've spent a lot of time with, with, with, in the health, with the mental health sciences, and also you came from a very traumatizing situation in Little Rock [Arkansas].  Are there any lessons that you've gleaned over the years that you can put these two things together and give us a tidbit of a lesson that you might have for us now?
Speaker 2: Well I think, one, one important lesson has to do with fear.  I experienced such extraordinary high levels of fear that year [at Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas].  I didn't even know it was possible for human beings to, to be that afraid.  But in the midst of all of that, I also discovered that fear does not have to impede your progress toward goals.  You can retain your goal-directed behavior in spite of the fact that you are afraid.  That was a revelation to me, and I think that's important.  And that's a lesson I try and share with young people whenever I talk to them, is that acknowledge your fear; accept it, because there will be things out there in life that will frighten you.  But you don't have to allow those things to become barriers to the goals you're seeking.
Speaker 1: Do you think that psychology has helped you understand your life, your, your past, and maybe to deal with it in a more, in a more healthy manner?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.  I think I came into the universe equipped with a lot of the stuff that I use.  I think psychology certainly has added some dimensions to that, but I would hesitate to put all the weight on psychology as a discipline.
Story_ID: 473983
Speaker 1: Now, African Americans, especially young ones now who are experiencing things in society, and there's always talk that things haven't gotten any better, and things are the same, things of that nature.  What are your dreams and aspirations for af- for the African American community in the future, say the next, next twenty to fifty years?
Speaker 2: Well, as I think about it, it, it would have to include the entire community of people, not just African Americans, because I think we're all in this thing together.  And I think that if we are collectively going to make sense out of any of this, we're gonna have to confront racism at its core.  We never have in this country.  We have pretended to; we've played games; we waltz around the edges.  But we are often afraid to even speak the words that are necessary.  We have to have a dialogue that by the very nature of the dialogue will be visceral.  People will vent and explode, and we have to be willing to go through that until that is all dissipated, at which time we can crawl back up to the cerebrum and begin to have an intelligent conversation about what we're going to do.  And I long to see that day.
Speaker 1: Do you think America is ready today for that now in this present moment?
Speaker 2: No.  We lack a lot of things: we lack competent leadership; we lack the will; we lack the commitment; we lack the history of leaning in that direction.  We've got a lot of work to do.
Speaker 1: Do you think there have been small improvements, or, or, or are they just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There have been a lot of cosmetic improvements, oh yeah.  We have put more lipstick on this pig than you can imagine, but it is still a pig.
Story_ID: 473984
Speaker 1: How would you want to be remembered as one of, one of the Little Rock Nine and as [HistoryMaker] Terrence Roberts in general?
Speaker 2: Well, I think about something a student said to me back at Southern Illinois University [Carbondale, Illinois], one of my undergraduate students.  We were crossing campus one day, and he just said of his own volition, with no prompting, he said, "Professor Roberts, the one thing I like about you is you don't treat me any differently than you treat your own professional colleagues."  That was a high compliment.  I could live off that for months to, you know, afterwards, because that's what I try and do in life, is to treat everybody as peer.
Story_ID: 473985
Speaker 1: And do you have any words or sayings or phrases that you can give us today that might help someone who says you know what?  I've been traumatized by fear, or I've been confronted with some kind of racism, or I'm trying to go to school to be a psychologist, sociologist, or a chemist?  Do you have any words that--or any advice, tangible things they can do to deal with that fear, you know, a small, in a small paragraph?
Speaker 2: Well, I think having, having an awareness of the reality of our existence is important.  By that, I mean having an awareness that as human beings, we have no power to create anything.  We just can't.  We don't even have the power to destroy anything.  The best we can do is participate in the process of altering substance.  We can light a piece of paper with a match and watch it transform from solid paper into ashes and gas, but that energy remains.  The only thing human beings can do is choose between the available options.  So what I would say to people is find out what the options are.  There are billions in the universe.  Unfortunately, most people use one or two options through the whole of life.  All of the other options go wanting.  And so if, young people especially, can simply inform themselves about the options available and begin to make choices that are different, that would be exciting.
Speaker 1: And do you have any last words for us or in the, in the listening audience, the viewing audience, that you want to--that is, that is very uniquely [HistoryMaker] Terrence Roberts and his opinion regarding life.  That was a great one, but do you have anything else that you think is very unique that you brought into the universe yourself that, that you want to share with us in closing?
Speaker 2: Well, maybe it's just that all of us who are born into the universe come with an extremely high level of potential.  To maximize that potential in every case would be my idea of an ideal universe.
Story_ID: 473986
Speaker 1: You mentioned a uniquely different environment in Little Rock [Arkansas] that was very unique to society.  Could you explain that a bit more?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know, we had a situation there where segregation was legal and social and desired by the communities, black and white.  Interesting, one of the responses to segregation from black people was to pull together and create as vibrant a community as possible, given the circumstance.  At the all-black schools I attended, Gibbs Elementary [Gibbs Elementary School; Gibbs Magnet Elementary School, Little Rock, Arkansas], Dunbar Junior High [Paul Laurence Dunbar Junior High School, Little Rock, Arkansas], Horace Mann High [Horace Mann High School; Horace Mann Magnet Middle School, Little Rock, Arkansas], an overwhelming number of our instructors were college and university-trained people, many beyond the B.A. degree, who couldn't get jobs anywhere else because they were black.  A trained chemist could not work in a chemical concerned.  A trained accountant could not work in an accounting firm.  But these two individuals and anybody else who was educated and as--and black, could teach.  So we wound up beneficiaries of all this knowledge.  Now, along with having all this knowledge, these people, these black teachers, also felt extremely responsible for our well-being, students' well-being.  And they understood that we needed to know things that went beyond the ordinary.  So, along with the academics, they taught us about life in the community, political life, economic life, social life; all these things were well known to us.  We understood, for instance, that segregation had nothing to do with us.  It was not our choice to employ that tactic.  We were simply part of it by default.  So I grew up, for instance, never thinking that racism was directed toward me at all.  It had nothing to do with me.  So that was very, very helpful.  We were then able to focus our energies on learning. All the students.  And although not every particular student in that school or the schools I went to paid attention, many did.  In fact, there is a, there's a book ['A Traditional Model of Educational Excellence: Dunbar High School of Little Rock, Arkansas,' Faustine Childress Jones] written by a former Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Little Rock, Arkansas] student.  Her name is Faustine [Faustine Childress Jones].  I don't remember her last name.  But it's about the number of Dunbar High School graduates who have performed well in society.  And the numbers, statistically speaking, go far beyond the normal when you look at other schools.  When you compare other schools throughout the country, Dunbar has an amazing number of people who have done successful things.  So the atmosphere was like that.
Speaker 1: So these teachers actually helped you to--well, helped the students as a whole to kind of move around the victim mentality they could have really gotten caught up in.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  We knew that there would be restrictions on our mobility, that we would face situations that would demand of us a lot of fortitude.  But we knew in advance this was happening, so we were prepared for it.  And we knew it wasn't our fault, had nothing to do with us.  We were--there was nothing wrong with us; you know, we, we knew that quite well.  And they exploded the myth of white superiority.  So when we interacted with white people, it wasn't with a sense of awe; it was with a sense of knowing who these people are.  And mainly we saw them as being totally misguided, totally misinformed, ill-informed, if you will, especially about black people.
Story_ID: 473987
Speaker 1: Now what role did, in your life especially and also in the role of the community, did the structure of religion play during this time period (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, like I was saying earlier, we spent a lot of time in church.  And for me that was extremely instructive time because I was able to figure out that there was something very important there, and that was about spirituality as a concept, as a notion.  And I was able to accept that and see that as something separate and apart from religiosity.  Religiosity had to do with the mechanics of going to church, of doing church things, of being on committees, and doing fish fries, and fundraisers, et cetera, et cetera, and being a minister, and shepherding the flock and whatever else was entailed, most of which had nothing to do with spirituality.  Spirituality to my mind had to do with seeking and finding God, however God is defined in life, and then living a life according to principles that matter.  That to me is spirituality.  I didn't find all of that in church, found some of it there.  What I found mainly in church was a group of people who were pretty much confused about things, who spent a lot of time worried about sinning, themselves or other people, keeping tabs on who was sinning and who was not, you know, and, and fascinating stuff.  But it had very little meaning for me, because I understood right away that all people were pretty much the same.  We were all vulnerable to the same pressures, the same temptations, et cetera.  It was just a matter of trying to figure out the spiritual part of life, just like we figured out the physical, the social, the economic.  The spiritual was always there.  But I don't think most people understood that.
Speaker 1: Were you able to merge--as you became more academically astute, were you able to merge that concept of spirituality with your new studies of sociology and psychology?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  For me everything was very consistent along the way, because the major questions had to do with how we all arrived here in this place, this universe, how did it all happen.  I rejected the so-called Big Bang Theory because it makes no sense.  It's absolutely absurd.  The theory of a God makes more sense.  Now, even though I can't explain it fully, there's something about that notion that makes sense to me.  When I try to place that beside the Big Bang Theory, the Big Bang Theory always loses (laughter).  In fact, I had a neighbor once in Southern Illinois.  He was a man who as a self-described atheist.  And this man lost a good friend of his from, through cancer.  And he came down to my house angry because his friend was dead, angry with me, he said, because, as he put it, you have a faith to hold onto; I have nothing.  So that anger was coming out.  We talked for a long time.  Finally, as he calmed down a bit, I said, "You know, you're son, Josh [ph.], is very smart."  During that time I was doing some testing.  I was a student and psychologist.  I was testing all the kids in the neighborhood to earn my credits in testing class [at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, Illinois].  And I said, "Josh scored very high on the I.Q. test.  He's gonna wanna know from you how we all came to be in the universe.  What are you gonna tell him?"  He said, "Well, I'll tell him about the Big Bang Theory."  I said, "Yeah, but Josh is really smart.  He's gonna wanna know how that all that happened."  He said, "Well, I'll tell him about the speck of dust."  "Oh, yeah," I said, "you'll tell him that, but he's gonna ask surely where that speck came from."  You know what the guy said?  He said, "Well, God left it and then took off" (laughter).  That was the end of his atheism for me.  But he surprised himself I think, because, you know, under those emotional pressures of his friend's death and my pushing him a little bit, he, quote, confessed that he had at least a vague belief in a god who would leave a speck of dust, which begins swirling around and eventually explode and create the universe.  Total nonsense as far as I'm concerned, but there it is.
Speaker 1: So would you say that science and spirituality have played major roles in your life to be able to deal with all sorts of, all sorts of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would.  I mean it's, it's hard for me to know exactly how these forces play out, but I think having an awareness of all of these things is important.
Story_ID: 473988
Speaker 1: And how about the current [U.S.] Supreme Court decisions that are occurring now with, with, with the schools and also the affirmative action things?  How do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Well, it points out to me that in this country there are people who are so imbued with this notion of maintaining separation of races, that it plays out in things like Supreme Court decisions.  You see, it is very clear that in this country most of us live mono-racial, mono-cultural lives.  We refuse to even think about living in an integrated society.  So, as we look at these decisions, we should not be surprised that we are essentially leaning in the direction of maintaining a segregated society through the way we handle all the issues that confront us.  Whether they be educational, economic, social, political, whatever, they all sort of lean in one direction, and that is to maintain the status quo of separateness.
Speaker 1: So what do you think the actual role of the courts and legislation is now with these decisions?  Do you think that they're doing what they're supposed to be doing, or do you think they are just as imbued?
Speaker 2: Well, well, it's a good example of how people on the court--in the court, especially as it's done, you know, with the appointments by our latest president [President George Walker Bush].  By design, these are people whose notions lean in that direction of maintaining the separate societies.  Yeah, there's no mystery there.
Speaker 1: So even with the, even with the advent of color into the Supreme Court, do you, do you think it's still some very, very--because we've had some--from Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, see you can't, you can't color code the thing.  Just because a person's skin is one particular color or not, you can't determine what they're going to do.  And, and of course, what's his name?  Clarence Thomas is much different person than Thurgood Marshall, even though they, they share this so-called skin color in common.  But, you know, Clarence, yeah, he, he has bought into this whole notion of maintaining the status quo.  That's his modus operandi.
Speaker 1: So do you, do you feel that legislation can't change the hearts of man?  Is that, that basically what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, pretty much, yeah.  I mean, you know, people do what they choose to do, especially adult human beings.  They do what they choose to do.  And so far, historically, as you look at the record it's very clear, we, the people have chosen to create a society that is racially separate.

Speaker 1: Do you feel that, that children now--we'll say people under thirty years of age, or we'll say forty and down.  Do they feel the separatism now, or do they--or is it more of class separatism now because of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think you can divorce those two things.  We have certainly class separations, but those two have a very definite racial component, you know.  If it were possible to draw a line between classes, and we could see some different activity in one class or another, you, you don't.  Whatever the class level, you still see the racial separations.  You don't see poor black and white people coalitions.  You don't see rich black and white people forming meaningful coalitions.  Well, you have some certainly examples, but those are mainly for developing ideas or plans or situations that offer profit to all the people involved.  I think if there's one denominator that brings people together, then that is economics, you know.  But it bears some real discussion, you know.
Speaker 1: And do you think there's been a shift in a place like L.A. [Los Angeles, California], which is a very diverse, racially diverse community, at least on the surface?  Do you think that with the, with, with the fact that we have blacks, and we have Latinos, and we have Cauca- whites, and, and Asian in this particular town, in, in, in Los Angeles, do you think that this broadens that problem, or do you think it narrows it down even further as to--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think it does anything.  I mean the so-called race issue is, is meaningless.  There is no such thing as race.  I mean when you look at it scientifically, there never has been.  All of these designations are specious designations.  The problem is, that it is important to those who want to maintain the status quo, to maintain this belief in so-called race because it keeps people at each other.  It's a giant game of let's you and him fight, you know, and as long as the people who sit in the power positions can promote that game, they will.
Speaker 1: So I guess my question now, has it begum--has it become more broader than just black and white?  Now is it, is it--has the game become now, now the, the, the, the inventors of the game can step back and watch others play it now?
Speaker 2: They can play different variations on it, have more players, yeah, absolutely.  But the same game is in place.
Speaker 1: And what do you think we--outside of the, outside of the things you mentioned earlier, what do you think can be done on an individual basis for each person to do something about this?
Speaker 2: Well, each person can decide to go naked to the mirror and ask hard questions.  For instance, one question would be what am I doing in support of this status quo?  How am I helping to maintain the status quo?  And then follow that up with, am I willing to change?  The answer is not a given.  So, to those people who say yes, then the next step would be to find out how.  And for those people who say no, to be honest in their pronouncements.
Speaker 1: That's been very insightful, and I want to thank you.  That's been great information that we can all live by and use in the future.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: So thank you very much again, Dr. Roberts [HistoryMaker Terrence Roberts].
