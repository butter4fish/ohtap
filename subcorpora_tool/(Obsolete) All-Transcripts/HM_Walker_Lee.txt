Story_ID: 604703
Speaker 1: Okay now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions we always ask and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Not a favorite food.  But I do have favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay what's your favorite--or, or--
Speaker 2: I like chicken, I like grits, I like rice, I like pork.  I'm not a seafood eater.  I like fruit.  I do not like onions nor garlic.
Speaker 1: Okay so a variety of things.
Speaker 2: I like to say a deep southern pallet that was developed--the bent for me was there and I just developed it.  I wasn't one who ventured out to taste different things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what is your favorite color or do you, do you have one?
Speaker 2: My favorite colors are two, brown and blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that has a, a lot to do with the south.  It's always warm and I enjoy the song 'Summertime' [George Gershwin].
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2: Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.  And it's one on the back of my business card.  It's a quote from Booker T. Washington (paraphrasing):  I do not judge my success, you know by the names or titles or where I live.  But I measure it by the obstacles I've had to overcome to get to where I am.
Story_ID: 604704
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That's similar to what Frederick Douglass said back in the 19th century too, yeah.  So I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  And we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Lois Lumpkin, that's L-U-M-P-K-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I do not know.  That's the one--she's passed away now.  That's the one date I don't have.  I mean I--I don't have from memory.
Speaker 1: So do you have a pretty good guess of when it might have been?
Speaker 2: I would say my mother was--I can get pretty close here in terms of my age.  Eighty years old.
Speaker 1: She was eighty when she passed.
Speaker 2: I would say she would be eighty now.  She passed away about ten years ago.
Speaker 1: She would be eighty now?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was born in 1924.
Speaker 2: Somewhere in there, the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was born during the 1920s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, she's the same age as my mother.  That's why I, I calculated it so fast.
Speaker 2: I could sort of--you know I could do the arithmetic.  She was sixteen years old when I was born.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know the, the month or the date.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that would put you at, okay, all right.  Well what can you tell us about your mother's family?  About, about her ancestors?  First of all how far back can you trace the family?
Speaker 2: I can trace it back to Africa.  History in the family was sort of passed down to each person, a male named Lee.  I have a photograph that I will show you.  There are a number of Lees in my family.  I don't know how the midwife and the grandmother knew this, but when a male child was born in the immediate family, extended family, the grandmother and midwife and look in they face at this baby and say that one will be a schoolteacher.  And then all efforts was, was pushed forward to make that one a schoolteacher.  So there are a number of Lees in my family.  I don't think any of us became schoolteachers, but we did get ourselves out of, out of the cotton field.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is interesting 'cause hardly anybody remembers--has a--can trace their ancestry back to Africa, even though we all know that's where we, that's where our origin is or we wouldn't be African Americans.  But--
Speaker 2: I don't know where he came from in Africa.  I've tried to trace that.  And, and one of the ways we trace that is because he owned property, a lot of property.  So and there were wills left, you know that got passed down.  A lot of the folks in the family could not read.  And I'm prob--the first one in my family that was really able to read all that stuff because although my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin] couldn't read and write, but--and I didn't discover that until I was in--almost in high school.  She would bring the funny papers home on Sunday from the white folks' house where she cooked.  And she would look at the funnies and make up a story and tell me, I thought she was reading.  Or she'd look at Donald Duck and she'd just make up something.  And the whole idea was to get me interested in reading.  And I had to go to Sunday school.  And every Sunday after Sunday school, I'd come home and she'd say, "Okay, read to me what you learned."  I couldn't read, you know.  Well you know first grade.  And I would tell her, you know, what was said.  But as soon as she discovered I could read, and she discovered that by having me read the Sunday school book, you know when I came back home, you know in the second and third grade.  At that point I remember her saying, "Okay now you're gonna have to read the Sunday paper to me now."  And I just thought she was forcing me to read now, you know I gotta read to her.  It never dawned on me she could not read nor write.  But that's one of the virtues that are missing today, the value of an education.  And common sense is not common anymore.  You know it--from a family that really believed in education, you know.  Education was your freedom.  Now as far as that was--my grandmother raised me.  And she had one sister.  My great-grandmother lived to be 102. She made Jet.  She died--
Speaker 1: What was your--(simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 604705
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She died--
Speaker 2: What was your grandmother's name and what was your great-grandmother's name?
Speaker 1: My grandmother's name believe it or not was Dora Lumpkin at that time.  Okay I'm talking about everybody just, you know, maintained the traditional family's name rather than the husband's, etc.  Maybe cause they didn't get married.  But my grandmother was Dora Lumpkin.  Her mother was Beulah Lumpkin.
Speaker 2: Okay.  B-U--B-E-U-L-A-H?
Speaker 1: Yeah, B-U.
Speaker 2: B, B-U.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Beulah Lumpkin and her father, the one that came from Africa somewhere when he was twelve years old.  As close as I can get to when he might have been born, was somewhere in the 1850s.  'Cause I've tried to piece that together.
Speaker 2: So you're the--you would be the one, two, three, fourth or fifth Lee?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: In that, in that lineage?
Speaker 1: Well I'm not the fifth.  There are a number of Lees.  See I'm just talking about--you know there's an extended family you know there too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Like you see for instance, I have a cousin that is named Lee.  I have a grand-uncle that was Lee.  So the Lees belonged to the complete extended family.
Speaker 2: Okay, but they all, they all go back to your ancestor from Africa.
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm now talking about all the folks from my mother's side.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And all--and this came down from memory, each one, you know, would say this and, and they had the papers.  He came from Africa.  He had told them and I have a picture of him.  He looks like a Mandingo warrior or something.  The chin and all this kind of stuff.  I just forgot to bring that one.  He was twelve years old.  He had a photographic memory.  His slave masters were schoolteachers from Georgia.  He memorized the textbooks they were using.  Ran away from Georgia over into Alabama, and talked to a printer there and developed a little book.  And he started a little school in a church.  Again, couldn't read nor write, but had the memory.  There was always someone around then, you know, that could, you know read and write.  He was always, you know--not everybody in the family could read and write, but there was always a Lee there.  And I think that started, let's see, my grandmother's, my grandmother's uncle.  Her mother's brother, was the first Lee.  He had an education.  He became--he went into the insurance business in Ohio.  He left Alabama and went to Ohio.  Was in the insurance business.  The first member of the family that I could remember was a Republican.  I knew that because when he died and looked at the newspaper clippings, it indicated that he was a Republican.  I don't think there was another Republican in the family till they got around to me.
Story_ID: 604706
Speaker 1: Now about what year would this be where he [Walker's great-great uncle] was a Republican?
Speaker 2: Again, I'm talking about the '30s [1930s] '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Okay now by saying that, are you indicating that he was the first one to get involved in politics period, or he was the first one who was a Republican, but the others were Democrats?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't--it, it wasn't too much political involvement.  He had to have been voting.  You know folks were voting for a while, and that depending on where you were.  I don't think--well even my great-great-grandfather, although he couldn't write, he had made his mark.  And fortunately he had to respect of the white folks he was dealing with.  And I suppose it--the folks who drew up the deed and this kind of stuff--it was a trust factor there.  Cause I'm, I'm pretty sure he, he knew where the land was.  I don't know what happened to the land, you know I still have the deeds today.
Speaker 1: But he had--your, your--you're talking about your--
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather [sic, great-great grandfather George Lee Lumpkin].
Speaker 1: He had land.
Speaker 2: Yes.  He, he had land in Ala--
Speaker 1: And it's been lost or something?
Speaker 2: He had land in Alabama, even in Texas.  And I saw letters.
Speaker 1: Now he's the one that, that founded the school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I saw letters where white politicians was asking for his vote for certain laws they wanna get passed.  Because he--property owners got a lot of respect I gather from just looking at the letters that, that he received.  And also knowing the story of how Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] was built, the reason [Booker T.] Washington came down is that a white man in Macon County [Alabama] and I was born in Pike County [Alabama].  My folks all came I think from Bullard County [Alabama], which was sort of north.  And it was similar to the county where Tuskegee is where a white was running.  And he would go to the prominent black in the neighborhood and say you know if you get the blacks to vote for me, I'll do this.  So the property owners were voting, although I can remember in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], it wasn't a lot of black voting, 'cause I never voted I think until I was out of high school.  I never even knew what a voting booth was.
Speaker 1: Well you never heard about it 'cause you couldn't vote till you got out of high--until you're twenty-one anyway.
Speaker 2: I'm saying, but I knew my, my folks were not voting.  And by the time I got to college, they were voting because now the '65 [1965] Voting Rights Act is, you know is out there.  But schoolteachers were voting.  You didn't have a lot of schoolteachers, but well, well my folks were not you know, great voters, but blacks were voting, you know in the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: In Alabama in that county?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's funny the way it is when we, we've interviewed lots of people and they--some places in the south like Memphis [Tennessee] and stuff like that you have blacks voting.  And then in some, you know, some isolated locations.  But for the most part blacks weren't allowed to vote in the Deep South.  But, but there are some places where you could vote.
Speaker 2: It all depended on where you are.  Like I said Troy [Alabama], Troy, Tuskegee [Alabama], Montgomery [Alabama] was a little different.  A lot, you know, Montgomery was, was the, the cradle of city of the south, the South had won the [Civil] War, Montgomery would have been the capital.  And they moved, they did move the capital from Montgomery to Richmond [Virginia].  So plus Troy and Montgomery were education towns.
Speaker 1: Now is Troy near Montgomery?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Forty miles from Montgomery.
Speaker 1: To the north or south or--
Speaker 2: Troy, Troy and Tuskegee are like bedroom communities of Montgomery.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The three largest cities in the state.  To the north is Birmingham [Alabama], that was steel.  Had no relationship to what was happening in the rest of the state.  Steel and coal in north Alabama.  And the rest of the state, you know there was cotton, peanuts, corn.  Whole different--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just for, just for historical clarification in the sense--the days that your great--is this your great, your great-grandfather, right?  When he was a Republican, most black people were Republicans.
Speaker 2: At that point, that's right, yes.  That's true.
Speaker 1: And we didn't really--we didn't become Democrats till FDR [Franklin Delano Roosevelt].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So he was--
Speaker 2: In the '30s [1930s] is when that whole shift, you know, started.
Speaker 1: So he was similar in his politics as a lot of black people were in those days.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And Booker T. Washington was a, as you described him before, he was a Republican and started the school and you know, had a influence over lots of black people all over the coun--country.  Every--most black leadership was Republican.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I'll say the leadership as I've sort of checked history, really started right here.  The first major black to switch to a Democrat was right here.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah with [William L.] Dawson.
Speaker 2: Yeah. William L. Dawson, right.  Okay.
Story_ID: 604707
Speaker 1: Now what was your, your great-grandfather's name [sic, great-great-grandfather]?
Speaker 2: George Lee Lumpkin.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is the name--
Speaker 2: I do, I do not know his wife's name.
Speaker 1: Is the name of the school known?
Speaker 2: No, but it--it was--I remember the, the church was a Baptist church.  I remember that.  I don't even know if it even had a name because it was out in the, the rural, you know, houses, you know three miles apart.  It was just a, a school.  I haven't seen any names anywhere other than reading the minutes of the church.  That's where I got a lot of stuff from, especially during the '20s [1920s] and, and '30s [1930s].  The, the church was, was sending out minutes from, from meetings they were having, and that helped me a lot as to that, that's how I sort of patched together about how old he was.
Speaker 1: So the church didn't have a, a name that you know of?  Just known as the Baptist church or--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know the name of the school, but I do have the name of the church, yes.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Well I don't have that with me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: All of that stuff is--I saved the papers.  I saved the papers with that--the deeds, you know when it--and it's just academic stuff for me, I'll pass it on to my oldest, my oldest Lee.  You know 'cause of that, I followed through and my first son is Lee.
Story_ID: 604708
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did your mother [Lois Lumpkin]--
Speaker 2: My mother--my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin] only had one child, that was my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did your mother talk about growing up in, in, in Troy [Alabama]?  Did she grow up in Troy?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: She wasn't born in Troy.  But she grew up in Troy.  When, when this great-grandfather [George Lee Lumpkin] passed away, he was very strict, very conservative.  Members of the family started getting off the farms.  My grandmother was one--I like to say she was, she was, she was very fair.  It was obvious that white had been somewhere there.  Because you know the two sisters, one was very fair, and one's very dark, you know same mother.  So later you know you could put two and two together there.  She had--her sister had no children, and my grandmother had one.  My mother had ten and I was the oldest.  My mother was married three times.  But she never talked about her growing up, other than she had to go to school.  She had to work.  I mean all the common things that folks were--I would say was, was doing back in the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Did she grow up in town or--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Troy, Troy is the seat of, of Pike County [Alabama].  So it was a small town.  I think for the last fifty years, the population has never been more than 10,000.  And the reason for that, the young folks leave, both black and white.  You know you grow up, you go to college, you know you go off and you get older and, and a few come back.  You know so it just balance itself out.  I thought that was sort of unique.  You know that you know over a fifty year period, you know the population would--it stayed around 10,000 with folks leaving.  Basically the youth, both black and white, you know looking for opportunity, better opportunities.  I left to sell--for better opportunities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you--but your mother grew up there.  Did--
Speaker 2: My mother, my mother grew up in Troy.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did, did she have a chance to go to school and everything?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's--my mother, I think she went to the eleventh grade if I, I remember (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did she have any stories that she tells about growing up there?
Speaker 2: No.  We really didn't talk about those kind of thing.  Kids were you know, had their place.  Kids didn't hang around the adults.
Speaker 1: Yeah I know your grandmother raised you, you said.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But did you, did your grandmother or your mother like tell you any stories about growing up and what things were like?
Speaker 2: I remember my grandmother saying a few things.  My great-grandmother [Beulah Lumpkin], I used to probe and she was telling me about, you know, the covered wagons and stuff like that.  But it's funny, you know, it wasn't too much passed along other than knowing who the, the cousins were and all that kind of stuff.  But there was never any talk about how they grew up, other than I know the great-grandfather was a taskmaster.  Sun was up, you had to be up.  You know only lazy folks were still in the bed, that kind of stuff.  They talked about things like that.  But when I think about it, it wasn't too much to talk about at least in--from my viewpoint as being, you know, five and six years old looking.  When you're out there on the farm, there were no playgrounds.  Folk weren't out playing basketball or football or anything.  You were going to school maybe three months a year because you were in the field working.
Story_ID: 604709
Speaker 1: You asked me a question and if I ever read Richard Wright.  You know, he didn't mention anything like this, say, you know what he discussed with, with his parents.  You, you look at stuff, I can show you--I saw the Ku Klux Klan [KKK].  I knew they had nigger knocking night when there was--and that's what they call it--nigger knocking night.  Whenever the white kids had a basketball game, you knew when that game was, was rather, and you knew not to be on the street after the game was over because--
Speaker 2: Because the high school kids--
Speaker 1: Because the white boys, yeah, would come by in a car with a chain and if you were in the street, they'd hit you, you know.  I, I also know that if you were sick and you had to go to the doctor, you went in a different door at the hospital.  And no matter what had happened to you, the doctor didn't come over to check you out until he had finished with the last white person.  So many times folks died, you know, no one cared.  And this where I mean I used to watch folks take soot and cobwebs to stop bleeding.  I saw things like that.  You know, all pr--
Speaker 2: These pe--people.
Speaker 1: Yes, you see.
Speaker 2: Taking care of themselves.
Speaker 1: Yes, because there was no black doctor in Troy [Alabama].  There was a black dentist.  You probably had a black doctor--one in Montgomery [Alabama], maybe one in Birmingham [Alabama].  Blacks went to white doctors that time.  And the--what I, what I realize is that a black's standing in my community was based on the white folks they worked for.  If you were working for important whites, your life was a little bit better.  You know the cops, you know wouldn't bother you.  Hey, you know, I work for Miss Ann.  A perfect example with me, my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin] worked for a white woman who was in charge of the draft board.  When I was eighteen, which is normally you going into service.  And when they sent for me, I didn't go.  She said our boy is not going to the service.  Our boy is our boy, is going to college.  So we'll send somebody else in his place.  So I never--coming out of high school, I had an academic scholarship.  So I finished high school May 31st and probably about--maybe around--by June 10th, you know I was on a college campus.  So then I, then I left home.  So you know leaving home a month after high school left me with a situation again, where I was at a age where would be get inquisitive, and I'm not there.  You see--
Speaker 2: Let, let me go back, though.  I wanna go back to we talk about your--
Speaker 1: They did tell me about the grandfather [George Lee Lumpkin].  I asked questions on that 'cause his picture as always up there and everybody would just, you know would just talk about that picture.  And that's what made me ask about him.  See I didn't discover the papers till I was in college.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know that, that's when it was passed down to me.  You know my grandmother was holding all that I suppose until she thought I knew what to do with it or something.
Story_ID: 604710
Speaker 1: Do you have any suspicions about--I mean you suspect that something that, that they didn't wanna tell you about, 'bout what happened to him?  Or, or maybe it was something that, that they didn't think they wanted to--that they didn't wanna talk about?  If they never talked about--
Speaker 2: They talked--I remember them talking about my great-aunt husband died.  He had a two horse farm, 120 acres.  Neither one could read or write, made a mark.  When he died, the white man came over and said to my great-aunt your husband owed me some money.  No one knew except, you know me and him.  I'll take the house and the land and I'll call it even, and you can have the truck, the pickup truck.  Now hell she couldn't even drive.  So that was--just took 120 acres, the mules and the horses.  I remember that.  I remember the famous lawyer in Montgomery [Alabama] who was [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.]'s lawyer.  My cousin who was older, and a Lee, who was--this Lee lived in Montgomery.  My family lived in Troy [Alabama]and in Montgomery, it's forty miles going back and forth.  The older Lee and he was about, you know, seven or eight, maybe ten years older than I was.  He went to this black lawyer in Montgomery.  And I'll never forget.  He said--the lawyer said, "You know a black man can't take a white man to court in Alabama."  So that--so that was the end of that.  He died of cancer and he suffered.  I heard the old folks said the Lord is paying him back, I'd hear things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They--any time something happened to an evil white, I remember them saying the Lord's paying him back.  I remember in New York [City, New York] I think it was Daddy Grace [Charles Manuel "Sweet Daddy" Grace]--some white cop ended up giving him a ticket.  And it was time to go to court, you know for some reason, white man dies--oh my God, don't mess with Daddy Grace, you know.  Coincidences, you know those kind of tales that--
Speaker 1: I think he said I, I didn't really wanna do it but you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know I heard lots of tales.  And I wish I could have written some of the stuff down.
Story_ID: 604711
Speaker 1: The men would talk.  But they told tales, stories.  You know they would go to fishing at night and they'd get around the fire and they just tell--who can tell the biggest lie I suppose, you know.  But they really was stories.  And I remember stories like John and master [sic, John and Old Master], you know and--
Speaker 2: Well these are stories handed down from slavery.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All the way from slavery.
Speaker 1: Yes, now see I, I remembered my great-uncle had a fantastic memory and he would tell me stories about John and master.  For instance he told me the tale about two blacks had stole some chickens from master.  And had them in a--had a sack full.  And the sack was full and he was holding one.  And after they ran from master's chicken house, they decided they would go in the graveyard, which was safe, and they would divide the chickens up.  So the one chicken that the guy was holding, he tied that chicken to a, a post as you walk into the cemetery.  And they walked, you know about twenty feet into the cemetery and start saying, you know, you take one, and I'll take this one.  Now while those two brothers were in the cemetery dividing up the chickens, another brother is walking down the street, coming from somewhere.  His master had sent him on a, on a journey.  And as he walked by this gate to the cemetery, he heard voices saying "you take this one and I'll take that one."  He said, "My God, God and the devils is dividing up the souls."  So he runs to the house, tells his master, "Master, God and the devils is out there in the cemetery dividing up the souls."  Now master was too fat to walk and this a big, burly black.  And his job was to put master on his back and anywhere master wanted to go, he would take him.  So master let's go.  The master jumps on the brother's back and the brother said "Well master, I'm gone leave you here at the gate and I'm gone get closer to see what they saying."  So his master hears them saying, "You take this one and I'll get that one."  And they got down to the last one and the brother said "you take this one, and I will get that one at the gate."  Now the brother heard this too and master heard it.  So he--I got to run and get master.  When he got there, master was gone.  So I mean and master been walking ever since.  You know tales like that.  They were not dirty tales.  Another one that they would all fall out and wanna preach, that kind of stuff.  It was too hot to work and they would have songs like 'I Fool Old Master for Seven Years, I'm Gone Fool Him Seven More.'  You know I heard those kind of stories.  Stories about Stagger Lee, Edgar Allen Poe.  They would take stories you know, that the white community I suppose--those that learned how to read the, the white kids' books.  And they could change that into a black situation.  And I said gee, now I bought a book that a black female did a Ph.D. thesis on folklore.  And this was the first place where I saw all these tales.  And these were common talks because when I looked through her book and she had interviewed blacks throughout the South and picked up this stuff.  So the tales that I was hearing were sort of common.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a--
Speaker 1: From slavery.
Speaker 2: There's another book called 'American Negro Folk Tales' by Richard Dorson.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That's really--it's got a lot of these stories.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Three friend stories and master and john.
Speaker 1: The Signifying Monkey, I remember hearing that.  You know I didn't think about trying to remember it, I just liked to laugh.  But, but I never thought about--I think at the time that I would have been very inquisitive.  Since my mother [Lois Lumpkin] didn't raise me, I wasn't there to ask her questions like that.  And you didn't dare, you know, ask certain questions of a grandmother.
Story_ID: 604712
Speaker 1: Now was, was your mother [Lois Lumpkin] close by or did she--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.  You see the first, the first husband--we lived in--with my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin].  I think she--the household was matriarchal because she owned some property.  Whoever owned property sort of called the shots.
Speaker 1: So your grandmother owned the property.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My grandmother owned two houses sitting right next to each other.  And she rented out one.  And the houses were built in a way where you walk in the front door and it's three rooms on this side and three rooms on that side and so the hall down the center.  And it would be what we call a living room, bedroom, then a bedroom and kitchen.  It's really just three rooms.  So it was--the living room was where everybody would talk, but it was always a bed in there, you know.  I remember the wood burning stove and my job was to cut wood after I came from school.  But I think at eighteen is when I really would have been very inquisitive.  And at that point I was away from home, I was off in college.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 604713
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: I only know on my father's side, his name was Amos Walker.  My grandfather on my father's side was Demp Walker.
Speaker 1: Do, do, do you have a date and place of birth for your father?
Speaker 2: Close.  I think he was born in Troy [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather was born in Troy.  Owned a lot of property.  There is a Demp Walker Drive named after him in Troy today.
Speaker 1: Dent, D-E-N-T?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  P, yeah D-E-M-P, Demp Walker.
Speaker 1: Demp.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Walker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He owned a lot of property.  I don't know where he got the money to buy it from.  He ran a store, and his store was next to the school.  So you know he sold penny candy and little stuff.  And so his business was just running a store, selling pecans.  I remember, I remember doing that.  He sold timber.
Speaker 1: Was your father older than your mother [Lois Lumpkin] or, or younger, or the same age?
Speaker 2: My father was older, my father was older.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what would you guess his age would be?  I mean his date of birth.
Speaker 2: They both--now they both were in junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he can't be any more than 'bout three years difference between their ages.
Speaker 2: Yes that's right.  I would say no, no more than 'bout three years difference.
Speaker 1: If he was old or maybe he was born in 1922 or something like that.
Speaker 2: And be--and because they didn't get married, you know is why I knew who he was, you know I, you know I'd visit with him.  And he was there, phys--you know I knew who my father was, acknowledged me and all that kind of stuff.  But I didn't--I wasn't living with him.  I had a stepfather.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they got together and, and--
Speaker 2: No.  It's class--you know just going to school together.  You know girlfriend, boyfriend.
Story_ID: 604714
Speaker 1: My mother [Lois Lumpkin] was very attractive, fair-skinned.  At times she sounded like a white woman at times to me.  She--because as my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin] worked for whites, she used to take my mother with her.  She'd sit her down so I could see where she sort of picked up all that.  And then later, then my mother started working for whites, you know, 'cause the two jobs was taking care of kids in summer time, then you go to cotton field.
Speaker 2: So you're saying that her manner of speech and, and probably--was probably influenced by--and, and some of her ways were influenced by the white people that she was around.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: With her mother as her mother cleaned.
Speaker 1: That's right, yeah.  And, and so was mine for that matter.  I remember there were only two boys in my neighborhood.  We lived in the first house starting the black section.  What separated the black section from the white section was a field.  Probably no--a half a block.  Maybe a hundred yards, just a field that would sep--that separated the blacks from the whites.  I remember if my mother was giving me a beating, I learned to scream loud and the white woman would say, "Stop beating that boy."  You know I would--then my mother--
Speaker 2: You could hear her voice coming from across the field.
Speaker 1: Yeah, only 'bout, you know it was only about hundred yards.  I screamed loud and then my grand--you know my mother would then she'd beat me and you bet not holler.  She didn't want that white woman saying, "Didn't I tell you to stop beating that boy?"  You know I remember stuff like that.
Speaker 2: These are interesting dynamics.
Speaker 1: But the other thing I remember with, with respect to the racism, I was accepted because my--in the neighborhood, in the white neighborhood, because my grandmother worked for these folks.  And everybody knew we had excellent food to eat versus some of my other friends whose parents didn't have such a job, who had to work in the fields or in the juke joints or selling liquor, that kind of stuff.  She would cook enough food for lunch and supper.  And she'd come home with a big plate full of food.  So I learned about steak and pork chop and all this kind of stuff which normally blacks were not buying, didn't have the money to buy.  So she'd cook enough for us and we all didn't have a pork chop apiece, you know, would cut it up.  But very tasteful, you know nice food.  And that was a common thing that all the cooks would bring home a plate.  You'd did all the shopping.  White didn't do any shopping.  I noticed if a black was not in school, I mean if white folks knew that, you know they'd tell that cook I saw your boy downtown, why wasn't he in school?  So you, you knew not to--you'd better be in school.  And if you weren't in school, there was no place for you to go anyway, you know so you couldn't walk around the street all day because the police was, you know, driving around.  So it was a closeness within that segregated community.  I, I remember if I'm walking down the street you know and white woman's coming, I had to get to the side and let her by.  No one told me that.  You saw it happening.
Story_ID: 604715
Speaker 1: This was in the 1940s right?
Speaker 2: And '50s [1950s].  Yeah and see I remember like you couldn't go in the front.  You couldn't go in--well we didn't go into any white restaurants.  There was a side door that you could ask for a sandwich.  The movies I remember.  I paid a dime to go upstairs through a side door.  And the white boy I played with all day every day, he went in the front door and paid fifteen cents.  I remember, which I thought was stupid, if the two of you bought the same shoe, you got your shoe cheaper, although the same shoe, because you couldn't pay as much as he paid 'cause that meant equality.  I said segregation had some stupid points to it.
Speaker 1: That is incredible.  I've never really heard it described like that, but they wouldn't charge you more, they'd charge you less.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: To, to signify that his, his shoes are better than yours, or he has better--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, I mean, I mean, I mean you couldn't--you know it was stupid.  You know you couldn't pay the same thing he paid.  You had--one, you ain't supposed to have the money.  But anything that was equal any kind of way was taboo.
Story_ID: 604716
Speaker 1: That's kind of a convoluted logic there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Only, only the principal in town drove a Cadillac.
Speaker 1: Of the black school?
Speaker 2: At school was segregated.  But he was--the principal--
Speaker 1: This is the principal of the black school you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Yes.  You see I said he was the most respected--schoolteachers were the most respected folks in the community.
Speaker 1: Not, not preachers?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Schoolteachers because the, the, the preachers were not all the time educated folks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know they were called to preach.  I mean they could read.  But they hadn't gone to college.  You know, no such thing as going to a seminary or something like this here.  I mean that was a holdover from, from the slavery days.  That wasn't true for all black ministers, but most of them, you know, high school education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the schoolteacher, for instance I knew how women had babies.  But I thought the stork brought the schoolteacher's baby.  They didn't do that.  The stork brings the baby, you know.  So I, I knew how regular folks had babies.  But schoolteachers, they were, they were up here.  They didn't do that.  You know the stork brought that baby.
Speaker 1: Now there's a--you know I think that this is important discussion we're having here about schoolteachers because I think it was a couple years, years ago we were in Selma, Alabama and we were talking about how the schoolteachers marched to the courthouse to vote and whoever else went the day the schoolteachers went, it was like the biggest day in town.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: When they walked, they, they lined up, you know, in rows, walked in that courthouse and sat in the--when they walked back to the community, they didn't vote, a chance to vote.  But when they came back to the community still in formation, the community went wild.
Speaker 2: Yeah, [HM] John [H.] Johnson's wife [Eunice Johnson] is from Selma [Alabama].
Speaker 1: That's right.  So that's a--I mean it's a--I mean the schoolteacher, the respect.  I mean the way those people talked--we interviewed about five pe--people.  The respect for a teacher was so high that it--I mean I don't think the people today--well I'm sure it doesn't exist like that in the community now.
Speaker 2: I, I, I mean it, it is no question.  I mean the same respect is not there.  Those virtues are lost.  You know I contribute a lot of that to integration.  But I remember Leon Robinson, used to own Robinson bus and we're very close; belong to a couple of organizations together.  His wife is from Selma.  And of course she knew Eunice's [Eunice W. Johnson] folks, (unclear) Eunice's father was a doctor and that they was concerned about whether John  was gonna make anything of himself.  You know she said that was a, a terrible situation there for a moment.  But she was one from a middle class family.  She got a chance to go to college up here.  And this was something that the middle class blacks passed around.  My folks were not middle class, so they, they didn't have that, that piece of data.  When you--when a black finished high school, all you had to do was choose an academic area or discipline that the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] had, and a black college didn't have it.  So we had no black college in the State of Alabama with a law school.  So the State of Alabama would pay people to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Yeah, one, one of the women we interviewed who was a teacher, went to the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota] to get her master's degree in education.  State of Alabama sent her.
Speaker 2: Leon Robin [Robinson], his wife--she, she was one of those folks, you know that State of Alabama sent her up here to go to school.  I don't, I don't know if it was Northwest--some place.  I know they sent her, sent her up to Illinois to go to school.  I discovered that after.  But I mean but that was information that flowed in the middle class circle.
Story_ID: 604717
Speaker 1: Now you've given us good information here, but I--there's some pro forma questions I have to ask.  I have to go back and ask them.  But one of them is can you describe your parents' personalities and, and tell us who you think you take after?
Speaker 2: Well I would say the virtues there and my character, is definitely my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin].  Well all of my grandparents, because my grandmother had this saying.  If you lie, you'll steal.  Or I mean you, you just don't lie.  And, and one thing that's coming in mind you say about they teach you about how to handle white folks.  I remember my brother and I were on the front porch and he had gotten a beating for doing something from my grandmother.  So I'm out on the front porch laughing about him getting a beating.  And an oil truck goes by.  So I practice my reading.  I, I might have said something like "Shell oil".  Well my brother goes to my grandmother and say "Mama Dora, Lee's out here messing with the white folks."  Then I got a beating.  You don't--I wasn't messing with white folk, I just read Shell Oil.  He said he's out here messing with these white folks.  So I got a beating and now he was satisfied, you know.  So but another example I remember with, with only two boys, one black, one white, and had a sister.  And I remember, now I'm growing up, I understand what girls all about.  You know and I'm asking--I, I remember asking the little girl, you know could I, you know, touch her titty or something.  And I remember she mentioned to her mother, and I remember her mother said, "Now Lee if you're gonna talk like that, you're not gone be able to play here."  You know when you think about Emmett Till who was killed for whistling.  Now there was a playground also near my grandmother.  But it was a white playground.  Now I played out there with this white boy and with the other white boys.  And one day other black kids saw me out there 'cause we would--we go in the black school and they saw me walk out here playing with these white boys, we playing softball.  So the natural thing to do is for these other blacks to say, "Hey if Lee's playing and Lee's our friend, we can."  So no one said a word.  And the whites did not run the blacks off.  When the game was over, everybody went home.  And the white woman called me and she said "Lee, you can no longer play in the park.  You have to play with John in our own yard."  And I--and that was obvious to me what she meant and what was going on; I understood that, you know, very well.  So I never had a bicycle.  I would ride--I would go up to John's house and say "John you riding your bicycle today?"  "No."  I say "Can I have it?"  "Here, take it."  And I remember once I was riding his bicycle across the train tracks and the back tire got caught in the track, and a train--a freight train was coming--(laughter)
Story_ID: 604718
Speaker 1: Okay, well your, your bike is stuck in the railroad track.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The back wheel is stuck in the railroad track and the train is coming.  And I started to leave it, I said, "It's a white boy's bike, I can't do that." (Laughter)  I get home, I, I thought this is a white boy's bike.  And the train is coming and it's tooting his horn and I'm pulling.
Speaker 1: That's a tough situation.
Speaker 2: And you know the Lord or angel was with me because when it got you know about, I don't know fifty yards to me, I was able to snatch it out.  And that train at that crossing did hit folks from time to time, that freight train come by.  I saw a number of people killed because there was no bars or, you know, train crossing.
Speaker 1: No signal?
Speaker 2: No signal, nothing, no, no, no--there was no, there was no signal anywhere in the South for a train to come by.  You, you better hear it and--
Speaker 1: So hear the horn blow or the whistle or something.
Speaker 2: Well you know you didn't have diesels this time, you could hear the train coming.  But it's like anything else, I mean how does these Metra trains hit folks today, you know, with all bells and whistles.  And those trains didn't have those kinds of bells and whistles.  Sometime they usually hit older people.  It was hardly never any kid, it was always an older person that didn't hear it, you know, couldn't run, move fast enough.  But I, but I, but I saw that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 604719
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  It's another question I was about to ask.  Do, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 1: Yeah, earliest, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, I think, I think my, my earliest it was I suppose around three or four, I, I remember that my mother [Lois Lumpkin] was always--I would say marrying to get away from the cotton fields, you know and Troy [Alabama].  First time she was married to my brother, my brother's father she was married.  And he took us to Georgia.  That didn't work out and my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin] would always come, pick up her daughter and her grandkids, you know, bring us back.  Another time she, she married, we went to Poughkeepsie, New York.  I'm still not in school at this point.  And I remember my grandmother coming up to Poughkeepsie, New York to get my mother and her two kids at that time, bring us back, you know to Troy.  And then I think--then the third husband--I, I'm a little older now.  I'm in high school.  I wasn't, you know, talking against moving.  I think he wanted to go to Kentucky, you know and I sort of talked my mother, you know, out of that, so I stayed in Troy.  So and but when my mother moved out of the house of my grandmother, it was still ten minute walk for me, you know to--I would go and eat with my mother, but I would stay at my grandmother's house 'cause at this point, you know, there was no one there with her.  And, and her mother [Beulah Lumpkin], 'cause her mother was still alive.  So, so when I was, you know was doing odd things.  And the other kids would, would come up as well, but I was the only one that stayed there.  And I just loved my grandmother, you know I think that was a--just a grandmother's boy.
Story_ID: 604720
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you and your father [Amos Walker] close?  Did you spend a lot of time with him?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.  My father was a decent guy, hard worker, knew his wife.  You know there was, there was no distance between.  When he died, he fell--he broke his neck, fell out of a pecan tree trying to, you know, earn a couple of bucks.  He was working what we call a sawmill.  There was a mill you know where all the logs come in and they slice the logs up into, into salable planks.  You know a log comes in and then you put that log on a machine and cut it in strips, that kind of stuff.  That's the job that my, my father had, which was a very good job.  No factories around there in Troy [Alabama], nor Montgomery [Alabama].  So this is what forced folks to be out in the fields.  It was no, there were no factories or anything.
Story_ID: 604721
Speaker 1: Now what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and smells.
Speaker 2: Bells ringing at noon time for lunch.  Now I'm talking about now on, now on my aunt and uncle's farm.  Or in the summer time.  Someone is sick or something happens, you rang the bell because you--and you would--sense the houses may be a mile apart, or half a mile apart, you only would ring that bell at lunch time.  So if you heard the bell ringing any other time, that meant help, you know, come.  Out in the rural there was no such thing as a fire truck.  You know you, you had to hope that your house never caught on fire because your water came out of the well.  There was, there was no hy--there was no hydrant.  No electricity.  We had outdoor toilets.  Smells, flowers, I say sounds of bells, train, birds during the--I suppose whenever--if--well in the city, there was a fire engine.  So you heard the fire engine.  But if you were out in the rural, there was no such thing as a fire engine.  Trying to think what other sounds.  Airplanes going by, course you heard, course you heard that.  I remember during World War II [WWII] sirens going off, you know.  I remember living in, in, in New York at that time is that you--all lights had to be turned off and stuff.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: Air raid warning.
Speaker 2: Yes, air raid warning.  But I think those are about the only sounds I can, I can remember at the moment that I would, you know, pay any attention to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: Folks didn't have clocks and watches.  You know you could tell the time by the sun.  You know it--you out there in that cotton field, the first thing you learned is when it's straight up, it's noon time.  And you could--you know you just learn from looking at the positions of the sun as to what time it was.
Speaker 1: That's something that people don't even think about now for the most part, but it's true, people could do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.  You just look at the position of the sun and tell what time it was.
Story_ID: 604722
Speaker 1: Now how would you describe yourself as a kid growing up?  Were you--what, what kind of per--personality did you have?
Speaker 2: I was a good kid.  Work--my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin] nor my mother [Lois Lumpkin], we could not go to movies.  We could only go to movies on Saturdays.  We couldn't go to movies during the week.  I couldn't hang out and play ball with the fellas.  I remember saying, "Why can't I play ball at the school?"  She said, "Lee what's the need of having a home if you don't live in it?"  I said, "But my friends are playing."  She said, "Well maybe they don't have a home."  I'll never forget that.  You--did I get beatings?  Yes, so, so I was not goody-good.  And the folks in the community as always watching, you know.  I remember going to school in the first and second grades--woman across the street would stop the boys and say, "Did you wash behind your ears this morning?"  "Yes ma'am."  "Come here, let me see."  You know, if I get up in the morning and I'm taking a bath now in a tub.  There's no bathtubs or anything, you know, you got--
Speaker 1: You mean like one of those--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: A tub, wash tub.
Speaker 1: Aluminum wash, yeah.
Story_ID: 604723
Speaker 1: Yeah, aluminum wash tub and we take a bath in a tub and you heat the water on a wood, wood burning stove.  And they stop and check you.  You know your clothes could be raggedy, but they must be clean.  And that wasn't just me, that was sort of standard.  What I remember most is that every adult was like your mother whether you knew 'em or not.  You know if an adult says something to you, there was no backtalk.  Didn't have to worry about that with respect to the teachers 'cause normally when I hear folks today talking about well the kids have no role models.  There was not a teacher in every neighborhood, you know.  It wasn't a doctor in every neighborhood.  So you know I think that's overdoing it by saying kids didn't have role models.  I mean that was a family thing whether they were educated or not.  I mean there was a, a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things.  And that was just sort of passed down.  That, that was sort of a societal thing, you know.  I never used--I, I don't even think I heard the term poverty till I got to New York.  I had--I didn't own a suit until I was a senior in high school and I saved my money to buy that.  A suit for me was a blue pair of gabardine trousers and a blue shirt.  Other kids had more than I had, there was no question about that.  But I never saw myself as being poor.  That was just--it was no low expectation.  There were folks who had more than you, but, but I never said my family was poor.  Owned two houses, so they couldn't have been but so poor.  But there was no money to buy me clothes I wanted.  I had to shine shoes, pick blackberries, sell plums, you know sell pecans to get my little spending change.  So character as just very--you didn't dare be a bad boy, you see.  I mean the, the adults in the neighborhood, you know you'd get a name.  You know, Dora's boy is no good, you know.  They tell that kid you better not be playing with Lee, he's no good.  So the community--
Speaker 2: That, that really stick with you if somebody said that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.  See if somebody said something.  If a girl got pregnant, you know she sort of disappeared out in the country, north somewhere.  You know she came back you know, mother had a baby.  Say my cousin's baby, something, you know because it, it wasn't a cool thing for a girl to get pregnant.  You know that was embarrassment.  I can't remember any white folks on welfare.  I knew some poor ones, you know 'cause when I picked cotton, there were poor white folks picking cotton right alongside of me.  Poor whites lived in the same neighborhood as poor blacks.  So it was much more sort of a class thing.  Now I mean whites didn't live in the heart of the black community.  It was always an edge there where, you know, this was a poor section.  Wood frame houses.  I remember poor folks had barbecue pig, and the middle class white folks had barbecue goat.  You know here you hardly ever talk about barbecue goat.  Everything here is barbecue pig.  But I grew up where most blacks raised pigs and chickens.  And I, you know I had to grab a chicken and wring his neck, boom.  When I tell my wife [Audrey Walker] that who was born in the Caribbean, she said "You, you would kill a chicken Lee?"  I said, "How the hell we gone eat him?"  She said, you know, she said, "How could you eat a rabbit?"  I said you know--she didn't understand how I could eat a rabbit, a squirrel.
Speaker 2: Did you have dogs?
Speaker 1: Yes, I had dogs.
Speaker 2: Do a lot of hunting?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  It's funny.  Most men had gun--had ri--had twenty-two rifles.  Likely they--and nobody was going around shooting anybody either.  You know you still had arguments, but you cut somebody.  You know everybody hey, they say shoot me, but don't cut me.  But when I think about it, at out in the country, everybody had a shotgun they put right up over the mantle.  You know like that was your protection.  Everybody had guns.  Guys coming back from World War II [WWII], they brought back pistols.  When it was no such thing as you know, the law taking them away from you, you know 'cause everybody was hunting.  So I grew up knowing that there was--it wasn't a gun in our house, but my uncle had a gun.  And we were in the city.  I mean no reason to have a gun in the city unless you--well I, I saw going, going out when whites shooting skeets.  I think it was skeets, and you're going out watch--you know working at that.  But there really wasn't--a lot of dancing going on depending on what side of town.  On my side of town, the fellas danced 'cause there were juke joints.  On a different side of town close to the school, the boys played basketball and they couldn't dance.  You know it depended on, you know, what was, you know your lifestyle depended on the neighborhood you were in, you know.  Like I said, my side of town had the juke boxes and so you know we were the best dancers.
Story_ID: 604724
Speaker 1: Was there very much live music?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  For instance I remember Marvin Gaye and all those guys, Sam Cooke.  And it's funny at that time, you know folks didn't have pianos.  I mean the harmony of these folks, you know was so fantastic.
Speaker 1: Now did you see--you saw them perform live?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You see I mean they would--at this time see they would go from town to town.  From one black church to another.  This is how they earned their money.
Speaker 1: Sam Cooke was with the Soul Stirrers, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  Blind Boys [of Alabama].  I remember all of that.  And I mean everywhere Sam Cooke left--I mean he probably left a baby.  I mean all the women was crazy--those guys come to town to get, you know, get whatever.  Single sometime, married--woman they want.  But what, what I remember most about the harmony, you know without music.  I mean these guys were just, they were excellent.  You know, some churches had pianos, most churches did not.  I mean that, that was sort of a luxury.  And if a church with a piano, it was out of tune, you know.  I mean who's gonna tune it up?  (Unclear) but I remember those kinds of things.  But I think I missed a lot by like I said, at eighteen I was gone.

Speaker 1: Now where did you start grade school?
Speaker 2: Ah Troy [Alabama].
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Academy High School [Troy, Alabama].  When integration started, they, they close--most of the black schools closed and you went to the white schools.
Speaker 1: So did you go to all, all your grades at, at Academy?
Speaker 2: I didn't go to a white school until, until college.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went the whole way from grade, from kindergarten or first grade.
Speaker 2: Twelfth grade I graduated.
Speaker 1: Through the twelfth.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At, at Academy.
Speaker 2: Black school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Forty kids in my graduation class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was the only student who graduated with an academic scholarship and I had a, a medal as being the perfect gentleman of the senior class.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: And, and, and what that meant wasn't goody-good, but senior class--I was sort of the principal's protege.
Speaker 1: What was the principal's name?
Speaker 2: Cecil Griffin [ph.].  He ended up going to jail.
Speaker 1: Cecil, how, I mean how do you, how do you--
Speaker 2: I mean Cecil.
Speaker 1: Cecil?
Speaker 2: That's the--
Speaker 1: C-E-C-I-L?
Speaker 2: I think it's C-E-C-I, I think it's C-E-I-L-E, no C-E.
Speaker 1: Yeah, C-I-L-E, okay.  Cecil Griffin.
Speaker 2: Griffin.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: The street in Troy was named after him.  He was the one that drove the Cadillac.
Speaker 1: And what happened to him, you say he got in trouble?
Speaker 2: When they closed the schools down under integration, he became a professor at Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama] near Birmingham [Alabama].  And they got him for say he was selling degrees.  You know, you know it was probably mail order type stuff.  You know you can get mail order degrees today.  And he really was a (unclear) principal, but you know it's like--it's a federal crime of, of sending something through the mail, gonna get you, you know, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Like mail, mail fraud.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's, it, it wasn't that he would just handing degrees to folks.  But there were probably folks who was sending stuff over the mail.  It probably wasn't doing all the work properly, you know.  Or was maybe missing a quarter or something like that.
Speaker 1: But when you were in school, was he like--well who, who were some of your--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: He was, he was--
Speaker 1: He was like your mentor, your principal?
Speaker 2: My principal, my principal was my role model.
Story_ID: 604726
Speaker 1: And I learned from Booker T. [Washington] how he cleaned up and I would go over and sweep my principal's [Cecil Griffin] yard.  And he'd pay me.  I'd clean up the bathroom, all that kind of stuff.  Like a houseboy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Now when were you exposed to Booker T. Washington as a, as a, as role model?  I mean of course he was, he was--he wasn't around, but, but the idea, I mean--
Speaker 1: Booker, Booker wasn't around.
Speaker 2: The history of him.
Speaker 1: But, but, but the Booker Wash-- philosophy was, was still there.  In the ninth grade black boys were the New Farmers of America.  White boys were Future Farmers of America.  Girls went to home economics.  Boys took agriculture, which was shop, but it was called ag.  Where he learned how to cut out steps and how to lay bricks.  It--the whole Washington pitch.  That instructor was a graduate of Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  So our first field trip away from the school, away from town usually, was when we got to the ninth grade.  He took us to Tuskegee in ninth grade, and that changed my life.  I had seen statutes, you know of Robert E. Lee, you know.  You know statutes of, of white males all around.  But I had never seen a man size statute of a black man.  And when I saw that statute, and you can see it in my look book I gave you, I still use that.  What struck me was the way Booker was dressed, like a white man.  And he had one hand on this raggedy child.  And pointing out in the future, you know.  And I read the sign saying "lifting the veil of ignorance and superstition."  I said from the color boy, cause I think I, I grew up knowing one I was colored, then I became negro, we were small N.  I still remember when, when negro was not a capital N.  That's why I really didn't wanna switch from negro to African American.
Speaker 2: Or black.
Speaker 1: Afro American.  Well, well see black was out of the question.  You know we didn't--that was fighting words to call somebody black.  But I, I liked the word negro because the struggle to get that capital N.  So that had significance to me.  But I saw Booker and plus I had read about Horatio Alger.  And Horatio Alger is, is positive thinking for the white boy, from nothing to riches.  So I read that and liked that.  But I divided it by two.  I said if a white boy can do that, you know I gotta divide that by two.  You know I, I might expose all that.  But when I saw Booker, Booker became my black Horatio Alger.  And I felt that, and truly believed, that he had lifted the veil of ignorance from all blacks, you know 'cause see the white folks was saying you were, you know, you were not smart.  I said Booker has, has proven, he got a university here.  It was Tuskegee Institute [later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] at the time.  It, it wasn't university yet.  So I said gee, I can walk with my head high.  Booker has, has, has saved me.  And he, he was nothing and looked what he--you know, happened.  So then I started reading about Booker.  And the more 'Up From Slavery,' [Booker T. Washington] that's what where the positive feel came from.  That's where I think living in a conservative area, I describe myself as a protege and conservative of the Booker Washington, Frederick Douglass mold.  Nothing to do with Republican politics or anything.  And it, and I start living, re-living Washington's life.  I went to New York City [New York] because I said if, if Booker Washington could take off in olden days with no money, basically, and go five hundred miles to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], hell I can take off and go to New York--
Story_ID: 604727
Speaker 1: Now, now let's--now let me go back to high school for a second.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Before we get you in New York [City, New York].  Now--
Speaker 2: At, at, at this point, I, I didn't go to New York to stay.  I, I just wanted to go to New York.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I think my first trip to New York, I was sixteen, seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were still in high school.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was still in high school.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: I was still in high school.
Speaker 1: When did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: May 31st, 1957.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think all southern schools end May 31st.  They don't have all the northern holidays.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to New York when you were sixteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: By yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your, did your grandmother [Lois Lumpkin] know you were going?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I lied to her.  I, I told her that I had a friend up there had a job for me.  And the reason I wanted to go to New York is that the summer before I had gone to Florida.  I was always adventurous.  Again, I got it from Booker [T. Washington], reading his life story.  I discovered that if you went down to Florida, you could do migratory work, you know, pick oranges and stuff.  And I'd rather pick oranges and stuff than pick cotton, cotton field.  You have to pick oranges, I could, I could eat enough, you know, in grapefruit and that kind of stuff.  And that--and you go to Florida and this was something that was commonly known, maybe within the Chicago Defender.  You know stuff is that you can go to this town and go to this particular corner and get work.  And I remember I convinced two of my friends, let's go to Florida and pick oranges and stuff.  All right.  We saved our money, we're on the bus.  Went to--I'll never forget, Plant City, Florida, still in high school.  And when were finished, the black guy who--he had a contract with the white folks, you know, to clean up this stuff and he hired folks and he paid us.  And we stayed in chicken coops, anything, you know and we had to pay for this.  And then he say I'm going north now to pick potatoes.  Anybody wanna go?  So I convinced my friends, let's go.  So we went to Dover, Delaware.  And I discovered that I was the, at that time, eleventh grade again.  And I was the only one that could read besides my friend.  These folks could not read.  Their whole life was migratory work.  And one of the white guys coming in on a truck to pick up these potatoes, he recognized that you know, I had no business there.  And he said to me you know if you like to do this kind of work, why don't you go to New York?  He said in Long Island [New York] they got potato farms much better than this.  So I slipped away from this black guy.  He, he was, he was like a slave master anyway.
Speaker 1: And you went to New York on your own?
Speaker 2: On my own.
Story_ID: 604728
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now, we left you in New York--on your way to New York City [New York] in the dead of night.
Speaker 2: The black guy was truly a slave driver.  I mean migratory work, that's exactly--you are a slave.  I mean and it's filthy.  We staying in houses where you could take a knife and cut the flies.  And you had to go in and clean these things up because see no one staying there, you know, until certain times of the year, the white folks didn't clean 'em up.  You would--when, when whatever black guy they hired to bring his crew in, they had to clean up.  So we had to clean the place up.  And I was always saving my money and was sending it home to my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin].  My other friend was spending their money, I didn't spend a dime.  I ate raw potatoes, boiled potatoes, fried potatoes.  I saved all of my money.  And the boss said--called me Youngblood, "Youngblood I hear you saving all your money.  You know you buying money orders and sending 'em back home."  I said, "Yeah."  Hey, "You can read too."  "Yes."  "Read this letter for me (unclear)."  And what it was--I'm getting, getting to this--getting out from him because his wife had written him a letter and told him some other cat was messing with her.  He said, "Younglbood you tell that nigga that Florida is gonna be too small when I get back."  I wrote it.  Now since this white guy now has told me, "You don't belong here, you know.  Do this stuff in New York."  So he would take us to the movies every Saturday.  You had to work six days a week, yeah Sunday he would let us go to the movies.  So I--there was a minister there and I told this minister, I said, "I'm gone box my little stuff up and I'm gone give it to you.  And I'll write to you to tell you where to send it."  He said, "Okay."  So now I probably didn't have no more stuff than go in this little bag here, you know kind of thing.  So we went to the movies and as the movie--before the movie started, we were all sitting there.  And I said to the other group, "Anybody want any popcorn?"  They said, "No."  I said, "I'm going down to get some."  The bus station was right next to the movie house.  I ran down to the bus station and I said, "I wanna ticket to Long Island [New York]."  He said, "You can't get a ticket to Long Island, you gotta get a ticket to New York City [New York]."  I said, "Well a ticket to New York City."  I got the ticket and the bus driver had left the door cracked 'cause the bus wasn't gonna leave for another two hours going to New York.  And I knew the movie would be out in an hour.  So I opened up that bus door, went in and closed it.  Meanwhile the movie's over; Lee is missing.  Everybody's looking.  The boss came and he saw the, the door closed on the bus and he's trying to look inside the bus.  I'm on the floor.  So they took off.
Speaker 1: Now, now I'm assuming now this--the way you describe the story, you assume that the boss would have tried to keep you--he would have tried to make you stay with him.
Speaker 2: Yes, there was no question about that.  See he, he had brought me free up on the truck, you know.  I was an indentured servant, really, and so was everybody else.  But they couldn't read and write, you know, just had so this was, this was their life in that part of Florida.  And so I caught the bus and on the, on the bus I was talking to a white fella and I said, "When I get to New York City, where can I find somewhere to stay and get some work?"  He said, "Well pick up the New York Times, they got jobs, full of jobs."  Okay.  All right so now I know when once I get to the end, I gotta get a newspaper, New York Times to find a job.  I get off the bus in New York City, it's two o'clock in the morning.  I am at--well you're familiar with New York City.  I'm at Port Authority I think on 34th Street.  I thought when I got off, when I got off the bus and walked out in the place, I thought that was New York City.  You know I saw five thousand people walking around.  I said, "New York is big." (Laughter) I'm still in the--I'm still in the Port--I'm still in the Port Authority, I'm not even outside.  So I saw a black man in a tie, suit, and I'm trained, you know, if a black man in a tie and suit, it's somebody you can trust--
Story_ID: 604729
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That might be a schoolteacher.
Speaker 1: That's right.  So I walk over to this guy and I said "Mister, do you know where I can get some work and a place to stay?"  He, he had this thick accent, you know and he said, "You have any money?"  Now I was a southern boy, but I wasn't naive, I wasn't stupid.  I said, "I got a few dollars."  He said, "Well come over here and let me talk."  He said, "Get me a hot dog."  So I buy him a hot dog.  He said, "I think I need a pack of cigarettes too."  I said, "Wait a minute, now, what's going on?"  He said, "How much money you have?"  I said, I said, "I don't have enough to get the cigarettes and pay for the hot dog."  And he said, "Where's your money?"  I said, "It's in the locker."  And he said, "Well let's go to your locker and, and you get some money and I'll tell you where you can get some work and a place to stay."  I said, "This ain't no schoolteacher, he's jiving me!"  So I saw the white cop.  And I said, I told him, I said "Okay."  And then I ran from him and stood right next to the white cop.  And he, he had a--I'll never forget.  He had a brown suit.  And he stopped and (unclear) "Nigga if I ever catch you again, I'm gonna kill you."  I could read lips--what he was saying.  The cop move, I move.  I was right there with him.  He wasn't even paying attention to me, but I was staying near the cop.  So I got by that and I think for a long time every time I saw a black guy in a brown suit, you know I went the other way.  So the next person I asked that question to, I went to an older man.  I said now an older person really won't lie to you.  And this guy was a porter, and he was an older fellow.  And I went up to him, I said "Mister, where can I find someplace to stay and some work?"  So he says to me, you see that fellow over there?  He said go tell him what you said to me.  Now this guy was gay.  I didn't know what the hell a gay was, okay.  Not a flaming guy, but--so and this was like I'm talking about right now this is--gotta be maybe 1956 or something, between '55 [1955].  I don't know, between '55 [1955] and '56 [1956].  I said "Mister that man over there told me you could help me find some work and a place to stay."  He said, "He told you that?"  Now since I told him, that that man over there told me and he knows that guy, and this guy probably knows that he's gay.  So he's gotta handle me now with kid gloves and he's listening to this accent.  He's a, he's a native New Yorker.  I didn't know what a gay guy was.  So he said well I can take you to the Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association].  The Y--meanwhile that's the first time I'm going outside the station; 'cause I thought I was in New York City [New York] inside the bus station.  He takes me outside, wow.  You know I couldn't--this is two o'clock in the morning, you know and the streets are full of folks.  I'd never seen this, this was culture shock.
Story_ID: 604730
Speaker 1: He took me to the all the local Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association], they were full.  He said  I live in Brooklyn [New York City, New York].  He said I got to go home.  He said if you're not afraid to go with me, you know and I was very spiritual.  And said you know the Lord will protect me.  So now my first ride on a subway, going from Manhattan [New York, New York] to Brooklyn.  We got to the Brooklyn, now it must be around four o'clock in the morning.  The Y was full in Brooklyn.  So he said, "Well I don't live too far from here," and he lived downtown Brooklyn, right at Flat--corner of Flat--Flatbush, I'll never forget that.  He took me home.  And his mother was there.  It's early in the morning, mama say what--"Who is this you bringing in here?"  And she--he told his mother how he met me.  And she thought I had run away.  She, she could hear my accent and she say, "Well you can spend the night here.  And we'll try to find you a job."  And I said, "Well I have to write my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin]."  So then when I said I had to write my grandmother, she said, "What for?"  I said, "Let her know that I'm safe, you know."  So I wrote my grandmother and told her everything was fine, I had a job--I didn't have a job but I didn't want her worrying.  Because I, you know--all that kind of stuff.  So she took--I think the next day she took me out to St. Auburn.  I saw Count Basie's house and her sister was a schoolteacher.  And when I went into this fine home, I say, "Gee, they living like white folks."  So I, I enjoyed that.  Found a job in a, in a rag factory.  And I, and I stayed there about a month and took the bus back home.  And everybody wanted to hear my story.  You know folks--they said, "Man Lee's dead, we don't know what happened to him."  But the minister did send my, send my stuff to this guy's house.  So everybody wanted to hear my story of a month in New York City.  So that was my first New York story.  And, and then after I graduated, then I again I went back on my own.  Again, told my grandmother, you know, had a friend--I didn't have any money.  She gave me and thirty dollars I think I--when I got off the bus again I had, you know, five or six dollars.  But at least I knew the fella that I had met.
Story_ID: 604731
Speaker 1: Had to been, could have been tenth grade 'cause it was two years later that after--'cause I went to Alabama State [College, later Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama].  See I first went to Alabama A&M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama] academic scholarship.  I left there the first six months because my girlfriend went to Alabama State and I said them cats down there with my old lady.  So I withdrew from Alabama A&M, came back to Montgomery [Alabama].  My grandmother [Dora Lumpkin] had a fit.  She called the principal [Cecil Griffin], can you talk to this boy Mr. Griffin?  Griffin, he tried to talk to me, but what they didn't know, man I had to be with my girl.  So I went to the cotton field.  And my friend said we knew it was nothing to Lee Walker, you know voted most likely to succeed and within six months, he's back here in the cotton field with us.  I said that's what they thought about me.  What they didn't know is that Alabama State was on the quarter system.  And A&M was on a semester system.  So I had to wait until the quarter was over and I stayed with my cousin in Montgomery, and that's how I did two years at Alabama State.
Speaker 2: Now, now did you--well I guess it wasn't that difficult to choose what school you go to, after you graduated.  You, you had like top grades.  But--so you were gonna go to either one of the other, right, Alabama A& M or Alabama State.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  I, I was gone stay in college, no question about that.  I just, I--you know I was in love (laughter).  I thought I was, I really wasn't.  So I didn't marry her.  And I stayed there for two years.
Story_ID: 604732
Speaker 1: Who were some of the, was there any professors or, or teachers or--
Speaker 2: That I remember, yes.
Speaker 1: Or, or people that really stand out that, you know, when you were in college?
Speaker 2: Yes.  One that stood out very clear to me is that I, I met him before I got to Alabama State [College, later Alabama State University, Montgomery] because I was in Montgomery [Alabama] when the bus boycott.  I'd go up and stay with my folks there, so I walked in the boycott.  And, I, I--after I got to State, I think I got to State in 1958, somewhere around there, fifty--
Speaker 1: So that was about, the boycott was over by then.
Speaker 2: The boycott was over, but stuff was still rough.  It was still the hassle.  King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was still in, still in Montgomery, was still patching up.  The bus rides, you know, is going on.  I mean the governor closed the cafeteria down because the whites were coming down from the North.  Now we're getting ready for the Voting Rights Act [1965], all that stuff.  Whites were coming down, you know to march, that kind of stuff.  So all of that was going on, but--
Speaker 1: Freedom rides were starting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  But the boycott was over on the bus, we could ride the bus anywhere.  But the racial was still hot at that time.  And I just felt this was still just too small for me.  I'm reading and I'm watching television and I gotta be like Booker [T. Washington], you know.  He--you know Montgomery now, I thought it was everything, but it's just too small for me.  I'm watching this black and white TV and I see the most important white men in the movies I'm going to see worked two streets, Wall Street and Rockefeller Center.  So I said, "Well I gotta get to New York [City, New York], gotta get out of Alabama State here.  These guys have no dreams, you know."  I mean reading, you know opens you up to so many things that while you're talking to your friends about nothing and the girls, other stuff is, you know I, I wanted to be somebody.  And, and I didn't see myself on the track of being somebody because my friends were not talking about being somebody.  And, and Booker was just coming all through me, you gotta, gotta do things.  So I said I'm going to New York.
Story_ID: 604733
Speaker 1: And I, I'm going to work on Wall Street or Rockefeller Center.  I lied to my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin] again.  You know she gives me thirty dollars.  I think I got, got off--maybe had five or six dollars when I got off.  Fortunate enough--went back to the guy I had met two years earlier.  Stayed with him.  This time I, I make him angry.  He says who in the hell you think you are that you gone--you don't want to work in a factory; you want to work on Wall Street or Rockefeller Center.  So--but meanwhile I got a job washing dishes in Queens [New York City, New York].  But the goal was when I had my days off I would go to Rockefeller Center or Wall Street.  And after two months--no, I washed dishes for a year, still looking.  Get myself in Brooklyn College [New York City, New York]; didn't have a dime.  Had to get into college.  Enrolled in Brooklyn College, passed the exam and they had a black dean.  I don't, I don't know his name, but I'll never forget him.  I enrolled and told the cashier I'd be back to pay the money, and it wasn't--about five or--see City College, you, you can go to school really free in New York City.  All I needed to pay was maybe like twenty dollars, you know 'cause the city colleges were free.  But hell, I didn't have the twenty dollars.  So--but I registered anyway.  And I went to class the first day in the summer and this black dean calls me out.  He called me out of class.  He said, "Walker, why are you in class and you haven't pa--you haven't paid your twenty dollars?"  I said, "I don't, I don't have it.  I won't have it until a month later."  He said, "What's a month later?"  I said, "I'm working at the city hospital" and you--and it was true.  You have to work four weeks before they pay you.  That's right.  And I said, "You know I'm doing odd things."  He said, he said, "Do you know you are taking up space?  All the folks trying to get into this school and you come in here with no money."  He kicked me out.  Okay, all right so I continued that.
Story_ID: 604734
Speaker 1: And then I moved from his house 'cause after five weeks or four weeks, I got my check.  Went right to the bank, deposited it, not understanding the small print, I misread it.  It said, you know, if you put this money in the bank, you can't draw it all out for thirty days.  So I misread that and said--I put, I just put my money in the bank and they telling me I can't touch it for another thirty days.  So, so now I'm skimping, going to Prospect Park, eating bread, you know I see folks dropping, you know, I'm eating candy to kill the appetite till I get back to the hospital to eat.  So a month later I go back and I said, "Lee, how stupid were you, you know.  You weren't gone take it all out."  So at this time I take some money.  So I move from my friend into a middle class section.  And this--I was earning forty--I was earning fifty dollars a week at the hospital washing dishes.  And this woman was charging me forty dollars a week to stay in her place.  And I took it because I had a philosophical view that if you wanna go up, you gotta be around folks who are up.  You know, you're not gonna get anywhere with folks who have no more than you.  You know I--you know this is what I said to myself.  So to--and she was a professional nurse.  Her son was named Du Bois.  She named her son after W.E.B. Du Bois.  She was a graduate of Lincoln [University, Jefferson City, Missouri].  And she took a liking to me and I had enough, you know, to pay her and I saved the money 'cause I didn't--for a month I didn't, you know have--I didn't take it out.  So one, one Saturday, and this was a private home.  She, she wasn't supposed to be renting it out in the first place, it was private home but, but she did.  And I wasn't gonna turn her in because it was, it was nice and she said, "Lee, why are you upstairs just sitting, reading?"  I said, "Well if I had a TV, I'd watch the television."  "You don't have a television?"  "No."  "Well just go get one on credit."  I said, "I don't have the money."  She said, "Come on with me Lee."  This woman--now I had only been in her house a month.  We get on the subway, she takes me to New York City [New York], we go to some credit place.  She said, "I wanna get portable television."  I think the television was, was 100 dollars at that time.  And the guy said, "How much are putting down?"  She said ten dollars, she puts ten dollars down and she cosigns.  And bring the television home, and I didn't miss a payment, you know.  And I paid her her money back.  And I was saving my little money that, that I'm working at the hospital, still going on my days off to Wall Street and Rockefeller Center.
Story_ID: 604735
Speaker 1: And a white guy drops some insurance leads in the doorway.  I came from the hospital one evening, I pick up this and I sign my name 'cause I wanted to have an insurance policy.  He's a Jewish fellow.  He came and he was gonna sell me some insurance.  And I said, "You know I--really I want some, I need some, but I can't pay you right now."  And he said, "What do you do for a living?"  I said, "Well I'm washing dishes out there, but I'm trying to find something better."  He said, "How would you like to sell insurance?"  I said I would like that.  I said, "Is that a--get a chance to wear a suit and a white shirt?"  He said, "Sure."  Okay that was, that was my goal.  So he--little did I know, this Jewish fella, Parda [ph.] was his name, he weighed about 300 pounds.  He owned his agency.  And he wrote out, wrote out a sales talk.  And he said, "You memorize this sales talk and this is what you're gonna do."  So I, I drop my--and I was on commission.  He didn't give me any start-up cash.  So I left the hospital and he gave me leads.  I had to get up early in the morning, distribute 1,000 leads, those cards, upon the folks' doors.  And I discovered I could sell one out of every five leads I got mailed back to me; would have teaching me.  And he called me every night.  I had--and he'd go over with me what I said and who I saw.  And what I didn't know when I, when I was earning fifty dollars a week and sixty dollars a week, I was really earning 120, 130.  And yet I'm still looking for this job on Wall Street or Rockefeller Center.  Another white fellow hear about me selling and in the meanwhile I have a sixty percent white clientele.  See no one ever told me that a black guy was--couldn't sell to white folks.  You know.  I was selling in my neighborhood.  In my neighborhood was all whites, well I did walk on the door.  Wanted--want you--wanna buy a policy.  And they bought.  So another white guy in Harlem [New York City, New York] hears about me and he wants me to come over and sell for him.  This is my first trip to Harlem.  And when I got to Harlem, that was culture shock.  I said, "Something wrong with this place."  I said, "I don't see any white folks."  I said, I didn't know of any place that don't have any white folks, something gotta be wrong with it.  So that was culture shock.  And then I--this guy gives me a contract.  Contract.  So now I go back to the other white guy.  I said hey, you, you cheated me for a year.  He--and I'll never forget it.  He said, "Don't you think I--you owed me something?  I trained you."
Speaker 2: Pretty arbitrary.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So after that now, my heart is, is, is no longer into this sales stuff.  I say I got to get this job.  And then--
Speaker 2: Now were, were you applying for jobs on Wall Street?  I mean too--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes on my days--
Speaker 2: What, what, what kinds of, kinds of jobs?
Speaker 1: The clerk.  I know it was--I was looking for a clerk's job and still trying to go to school too at night.  And I remember I, I went in Brooklyn and they had a black teller.  I said, "How did you get that job?"  He said, "Well the headquarters, Manufacturers Hanover Trust."  He said, "The headquarters is on Wall Street.  Go over now."  And I went over.  I said, "I wanna be a bank teller."  Man said, "Do you think we just hire bank tellers off the street--"

Speaker 1: He [Booker T. Washington III] was an architect and had worked on the Pan Am building [later, MetLife Building, New York, New York] there.  And I think he had went to Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and Columbia University [New York City, New York].  And he'd quiz me and we became very good friends.  And I was the master of ceremonies at his memorial when he passed away.
Speaker 2: Who's this?  This is the--
Speaker 1: Booker T., III.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: He died in '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the family has made me a, a cousin of the family.  I am considered an expert on Booker [T. Washington].  I've been going to the Library of Congress and I have my little cards and papers, studying all of Booker Washington's papers.  I met the Professor Louis Harlan who spent twenty-five years writing the Booker T. Washington papers and won in '84 [1984] Pulitzer Prize [for Biography or Autobiography].  Debated with him.  Anywhere that I read about one of the white professors who are experts in black history and have written about Washington and [W.E.B.] Du Bois, I go and find them and ask if I can take them to lunch or dinner.  And they say for what?  I say I wanna talk about Booker.  So--and Du Bois.  So all of that.  So I got all of this from Booker you know, Booker was practical.  And you know I mean he always would look at folk and say, "Now what are you really up to?  I hear what you're saying, but what are you really about here?"  And he was always positive.  And I felt results-oriented.  So that's really--you know he was asking the question--this is really where I, I got it, you know.  I could always find a passage about Booker.  And like I said, I don't know if I didn't give you--see the back of my card.
Speaker 2: Right, right you got the quotation the back of the card.
Speaker 1: I lived through corporate America, you know that kept me from going crazy.  I never worried about I wasn't being promoted as fast as the white fellows.  And the peace was Booker--I got it from that--Booker at one point said he hated white kids for a long time.  They got a chance to go to school and he couldn't go.  And he said then he thought about it.  He felt sorry for the white boys because everything he had achieved, he had to work for.  And they were getting ahead only because they were white.  He said they have no character; they're not working for anything, you know.  He said you gotta work hard.  And this is what he did at, at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], you know in I suppose the president of Hampton, you know Booker was his protege--Armstrong [Samuel Chapman Armstrong].  So Booker had used him as a role model.  And I used Booker, you know as, as my role model and, and reading so much about him, I, I, I just knew how he would handle those situations.  And what I've said to kids in high school, the importance of having a goal.  See with all my moving around, the goal was to get a suit and white shirt and attache case, and to be on--in Rockefeller Center or on Wall Street; that was the main goal.  All the other stuff I was doing was just stuff I had to do to, to get to the main goal.
Speaker 2: Oh okay. Now--(simultaneous)
Story_ID: 604737
Speaker 1: Now we left off at the last reel you had just arrived at Harlem [New York City, New York], and so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I s-I so--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --so, so, so where--let's pick up.
Speaker 2: When I arrived in Harlem, I didn't sell for that guy. I worked by the--you know, five or six months.  I was really let down by this other guy, I had been used.  And that was my fault.  You know you gotta be (unclear).  My education--I should have, I should have suspected that he wrote me out a contract on a piece of paper.  I didn't have a real contract.  And then I said, "Well the Lord at least taught me something here.  Now I know that that, you know, I can't change yesterday."  And I wasn't gonna deal with anything that was gonna take me off my trail.  So I confessed and talked about it to the priest, you know when I go to confession on Saturdays.  'Cause I, I was Catholic.  I, I switched from the Baptist church to the Catholic Church in Montgomery [Alabama].  'Cause they had one white priest and he'd go around from church to church, and the black church on one Sunday, the white church the next Sunday.  Go around all the towns.  So I went to Catholic Charities in New York [City, New York].  I went to St. Patrick's Cathedral and talked to the priest there.  I didn't get any help from St. Patrick's Cathedral, from Catholic Charities.  And then one day I saw in the New York Times office clerk in Rockefeller Center.  And I had just finished reading Irving Stone's book about Michelangelo [sic, 'The Agony and the Ecstasy].  And Michelangelo wanted to be a Leonardo da Vinci.  I mean he was bright, a genius.  Michelangelo was a poor fellow.  And when he went to Florence [Italy] to the masters and say, "I wanna learn how to paint" and they said, "Can you paint?"  And Michelangelo did not say no.  He said to the master, "I have the capacity to learn."  "Okay, I'll give you a try."  That line stuck with me.  I said here's a beautiful way of never saying no.  I have the capacity to learn.  Now meanwhile, I had spent at this point two years in college.  Between Alabama A & M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Huntsville, Alabama], Brooklyn [College, New York City, New York] and Alabama State [College, later Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama].
Story_ID: 604738
Speaker 1: So was this about 1961?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you hit it right on the head.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I said now the New York Times is saying this job pays fifty to fifty-five dollars a week.  So I said to myself now they advertising for a white boy.  So the white boy would probably get the fifty-five dollars, so I'm gonna, I'm going check on this place and say I'll do it for fifty.  And it was a law firm.  A shopping center management.  I mean a lawyer was interviewing me.  He needed an office boy.  The office boy they had was the controller's son for the summer and it was, excuse me, now September.  He was going back to college; they needed an office boy.  So the lawyer is interviewing me and I said something like cooperation or corporation.  He said, "Lee the word is corporation, not cooperation."  I said, "Thank you very much."  He said, "Lee can you file?"  I didn't know what the hell filing was.  File.  And I said, "I have the capacity to learn."  He looked at me, he said, "You read Agony, Agony and Ecstasy [sic, 'The Agony and the Ecstasy,' Irving Stone] didn't you?"  I said, "Yes I did."  He said, "I'm gone give you a shot at it."  He said, "I'll start you off at fifty dollars a week."  I was very glad.  He showed me the stock room.  He said, "This will be your office," and had a cement floor and all the papers and pencils were in there.  So he said, "There's a stool or something, you can sit around."  He said your job will be to take--he said, "We own three floors.  And your job will be to go from one floor to the other carrying mail.  And I need you to take leases from here down to Wall Street to lawyers on, on Wall Street.  Signing up stores, chain stores to go in shopping centers."  So the very first day, and I think this was a Monday, lunch time came.  Everybody went out to lunch.  I went to the back door and there was a black Cuban.  I said to him, "Can I have a mop and a bucket?"  He said, "A mop and a bucket.  What you gone do with it?"  I said, "I want some, some stuff I wanna do here in the stockroom."  Little did I know, you know they pay folks to clean up the place.  Now it was no carpet in there.  It, it was cement and it was black, you know, walking on it.  I got this mop, bucket and soap.  So when the folks came back after lunch, the damn room in there was white.  They looked, boy I could hear all the whispering.  Go in the stockroom.  What do we have here?  Booker [T. Washington] clean, that was Booker test going into Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  I mean he cleaned the room three times and the white woman took her handkerchief and rubbed it up under stuff and she could not get any dust.  So I knew Booker got into school because he cleaned well.  And this is my office and it's gotta be clean, you know.  So then they said to me, "Well Lee you can sit out here, you know."  They moved me from sitting in the stockroom now I could sit outside.  And they'd call me, you know when they got ready for me.  Then the lawyer said to me, "Well Lee, you know we don't wear pink shirts in here.  You know we--white shirts."  And he said, "You can go around the corner and get a three piece, got a little cheap, three piece suit."  This lawyer say you know, he say, "You see I have three piece on?"  He would wear a straw hat.  A Saks Fifth Avenue straw hat.  Now I'm in Rockefeller Center, you know that was the goal, I was there.  Office boy.  That Friday I didn't get fifty dollars, I got fifty-five.  The next week I think I got sixty.  Make a long story short, at the end of ten years I was an officer of the company (laughter).  So director of employee relations.
Story_ID: 604739
Speaker 1: And it was--I would say-(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: This sounds like how to succeed in business without really--but you were really trying though.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well--
Speaker 2: It was the opposite of--
Speaker 1: I have an article in here which I'll give you.  The New York Amsterdam News--well the New York Times wanna do a story on me, and I said no.  Gotta be a black paper first.  I don't want folks saying white folks made you.  You know I remember the Booker [T. Washington] stuff, you know.  Everybody thought Booker was a Tom because he was with the white folks, you know and I'm saying, they don't understand.  They got a lot of poor white folks who get rich hanging round rich white folks, you know.  Booker happened to be black, you know.  So I was able to take race out of the issue at certain times.  Race is always there.  But see my view if Booker was a Tom and he wasn't the only black around, he wasn't the only black at, at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], and he wasn't the smartest black at Hampton.  So I say, well how did he become the best Tom?  You know, if that what he was.  And you know why did Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] become the best black school known all around the world?  You know so that was where my head was.  So I worked very hard at the company.  But between that time, you know the lawyer had me take an exam.  I became a notary.  He wanted to brag about me.  'Cause see the white boys would brag about who had the smartest office boy.  And he was trying to outdo the white W.A.S.P. [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] lawyer on Wall Street by saying my boy's a notary, he'll notarize it right there while you sign it.  Your, your boy is a notary?  How--you know--I passed the damn exam.
Speaker 2: So, so you worked for a Jewish firm?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was a Jewish firm.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the firm?
Speaker 1: Winston-Muss Corporation.
Speaker 2: Winston.
Speaker 1: Yeah, an
Speaker 2: Winston what now?
Speaker 1: Muss, M-U-S-S.
Speaker 2: Okay, Winston-Muss.
Speaker 1: [David] Muss was a South African Jew, he was born in Cape Town [South Africa].  And I became his protege.  And, and that was a story too.  I think I became his protege because I didn't mess with his wife.  He sent me up when I was office boy, he sent me up to his house on Park Avenue, it was on Sutton Place.  And to get his eyeglasses.  And he had been married to a Jew, divorced her and married one of the Reynolds Aluminum daughters, Muss did.  And she was 'bout twenty-five years younger than he.  And when I rang the bell, you know the maid came to the door.  And she said Mrs. Muss, you know, will give you the glasses.  Meanwhile, she walked by, coming from the bathroom.  You know she was naked.  You know and she--and me, I'm a southern boy.  White woman?  Boy, my eyes locked the other way.  So--and she saw I wasn't, you know I wouldn't look.  So I think that interested her.  So the next day--and the president's secretary, Dave Muss, he had a male secretary.  In those days the big firms had male secretaries, they didn't have female secretaries around there.  It was, you know, heavy stuff, and they were all college graduates and could type, and they wasn't gay either, you know but that was--'cause Emmett Scott was Booker Washington's secretary.  She calls down there and she said, "I have an errand for your office boy to run."  Her husband wasn't stupid, but why does she--she mean she got an errand for him to run?  He works for me.  So I go back up and run this errand and again my eyes lock, I pay no--but I, I ran some thoughts through myself.  I said, "Now Lee, what's going on here?"  I said, "Most she can do for you is buy you a suit from Saks Fifth Avenue.  You lose your job, then what?"  I said, "No, no.  You know my little sixty dollars a week is important."  I came back and I'm sure he questioned her and, and she probably said you know, something wrong with him, he ain't look, whatever. But from that day on I became his protege.  And (unclear) say, "Lee, I'm gone show you how to buy folks today."  Politicians you wanna--he wanted to build a shopping center, Smith Town, you know.  And I would ride in the limousine with him, and would carry his attache case and learning all of this in.  That's how this moves up.  And then another one of the officers of the company was jealous.  I had a white secretary.  And she said to me, "Lee, Mr. Martin says, 'Who does Lee think he is?  He's hanging around Muss too much.'"  By this time now I'm wearing tailor made coming from Hong Kong [China], three piece suits, you know.  And I got my boutonniere.
Story_ID: 604740
Speaker 1: Now how many years in is this?  Is this, is this--
Speaker 2: I was, I was there ten years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how many--but when did you start wearing the tailor made suits and becoming a, a protege of [David] Muss?
Speaker 2: After I didn't mess with the wife.
Speaker 1: About what year is this in, in the tenure?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  This had to be--
Speaker 1: So you started in '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  I can--when was the March on Washington?
Speaker 1: Sixty three [1963].
Speaker 2: So I remember that's around--I was coming in six, between (unclear) '65 [1965], all in there.  Because I went to Sears in '70 [1970], and that was intentionally.  They didn't want me to leave.  But I also had (unclear) Whitney Young helped a group of us start the first young group of black executives.  'Cause by this time affirmative action is in.
Speaker 1: So after, yeah let me write that--make sure I--you go back to that.  But take us--con--continue with where you were.  Now you're, you're the--now kind of being acknowledged as a protege of Winston-Muss, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes.
Story_ID: 604741
Speaker 1: You know they were probably saying behind my back, "That's [David] Muss' nigger," you know.  But that didn't worry me.  You know I'm now Booker [T. Washington].  I'm got an important person here, you know, behind me.  And the lawyer, I'm a notary.  You know now I'm at--now--and I had left Brooklyn College [New York, New York] because they say--had told me, the white boy had told me you know for Corporate America Lee, NYU [New York University, New York City, New York].  So I went to NYU I, I surprised myself.  NYU gave me an exam, it was a tough one.  And this is be--prior to them getting a point for being black and all this stuff.  Wasn't that popular then.  NYU tested me and said, "Mr. Walker, you gotta take six months of reading and writing comprehension, and six months of college algebra."  I said, "Well if that's what it takes to stay here, that's what I'll do."  Now I had to take that from them.  And when I got that class, I mean I wasn't the only person in there, and it was full of whites, and this was the root.  You know if you, you know take the exam and this is what you did.  And everyone knew once you go into the regular classes, you had passed everything, so it wasn't no such thing as affirmative action type thing then.  And I met Marvin Kalb, one of my professors.  His brother was Ben Kalb on, on television.  And he said to me, "Lee, you're gonna go places."
Speaker 2: Kalb, K-A-L-B?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Marvin Kalb, the, the radio announcer and TV announcer.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So he was telling me about his (unclear).  He said you're gonna go places.  At that point, he could see the ambition and you know and I--I was aggressive in class.  I wanted to learn all I could.  When I--I don't know how fast one should read.  I still have the--my reading exam today from NYU  I was reading 250 words a minute.  I don't know what one should be reading.  I'd been tested for reading, how fast you read.  And after six months, I was reading between six, 700 words a minute.  And I been reading (unclear).  And it wasn't a speed read that they taught you.  It was really how to read.  And you read with your eyes, not with your lips.  You see reading with your lips slow you up.  You learn first how to see two words and three words and you, you, you learn how to see a sentence.  Because the eyes are, you know, can, can take in a whole lot.  And to practice for that is like I'm also (unclear) I'd rather caddy than play--pick cotton.  So and this reading was a little like golf.  You, you had to get yourself prepared to--if--because I'm working with a machine and you can easily test yourself by when you go to the movies and you see the credits moving.  If you can read that, it tells you if it's moving too fast.  That tells you how fast that you're lip reading.  And--or watching the credits on television.  And that's how I was--the instructor taught me to read.  And those credits would be moving just like I said and you had to read that.  So--and they also taught you how to read the New York Times.  I had no idea that the New York Times was what, you know, international news, national news, local news, all that was spaced.  And the professor had said if you read just the Sunday's New York Times five years in a row, you'd have the equivalent of a master's degree because the Sunday New York Times covered every area of education.  So that kept me on the New York Times side.  And then I knew corporate America, you had to read the, the Wall Street Journal, so I, you know, I was into that.  Now by this time, affirmative action is hitting and a group of us discovered--well my take on it when affirmative action hit, most white boys thought they'd have a black boss within six months.  And I like to describe it--six months passed, nothing happened.  A year passed, nothing happened, you know.
Story_ID: 604742
Speaker 1: Affirmative action hits around 1964 or so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, but let--let's go back a little bit to--now you say you, you were--all this is going on around the time of the, the March on Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the civil rights activity.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You said that Whitney Young, who's director of the [National] Urban League.
Speaker 2: At that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Helps you all form a group of black executives.
Speaker 2: Which I had, yeah I have pictures here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what, what was--tell us about that--how, how did that take place?  How did that get started?
Speaker 2: Well we--a group of us in the Rockefeller Center area, there were only three blacks working in the Rockefeller Center area.  I was there, another fella was office boy at Union Carbide on Park Avenue, and another fella was at an advertising agency, also in Rockefeller Center.  So we got together and we all planned our little move up stuff, you know when we was reading all of the textbooks.  And we, we bragged about who understood the most about capitalism, you know, in the marketplace.  We, we, were really preparing ourselves to move up because like I say affirmative action and all this kind of stuff.  So Whitney Young used to tell us, he said fellas, I don't let you down.  Whitney said every white chairman he spoke to, that chairman wanted to know if he knew his one black.  See every company had one.  And Whitney say everybody think I should know that one.  He said, he said, "Do you know Lee?"  Say, "Sure, Lee's fine, you know," you know he said he wasn't gone let us down.  And then Whitney did two things.  With Ray Dejohn--he had a female there.  They set up this visiting professors thing where black executives could go down to southern schools and teach for a week, call it visiting professors.  The reason for that was to give you visibility back in the corporate world.  Make them think, "Hey, you know, my boy's smart, you know.  He going down, he's teaching."  So that you could--that heightens your visibility back in corporate America.  Now Whitney also helped us start the first national black executive organization, it was called C.C.B.E., Council of Concerned Black Executives.  Not everybody wanted to join that.  John Procope, who at that time was running the, the New York Amsterdam News, I tried to get him in.  He said, "Lee I like what y'all guys are doing, but this word black disturbs me here.  I mean why do you have to be concerned black executives?"
Speaker 1: Council of Concerned Black Executives.  Now this is, yeah this is before black became popular.  Before black--now, now or was it?  Now, now--Stokely [Carmichael] coined black power in '64 [1964], '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is just happening right at, right at the Black Power Movement, time, you know.  So, so that was the reason for that.  After a year, we split up over, over--really over ideology or strategy.  One part of the group felt that we should not take white money.  On my side of the aisle, I said they aren't promoting us, they aren't training us properly, and we are going to say to these companies we will train ourselves.  And we want you to donate to our organization because we are developing training programs that make us more productive for you--this, this company.  The companies bought that.  We said also we want you to give us a person on loan, on your payroll, to work with us for a year.  Sears gave me a guy, Allied Chemical gave us a lawyer, IBM gave us a guy.  So we rented space and we--now we were the group who wanted the white money.  The other group, they did the black thing.  Said we will raise our money; didn't raise anything, you know.  How you gonna raise--you know.  So we became the most visible and the most successful.  And the name of that group was A.I.M., the Association for the Integration of Management.
Story_ID: 604743
Speaker 1: All right sir, tell us about--you were telling us about the formation of the last--the two black executive organizations.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how they morphed into the Association for the--
Speaker 2: Integration of Management.
Speaker 1: Integration of Management.
Speaker 2: Yeah, A.I.M. [Association for the Integration of Management]
Speaker 1: That was formed in '68 [1968] and '69 [1969], yeah, A.I.M.  Now but I wanna take you back a little bit.  You, you talked about being in the, in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] with [HM] Earl Graves in Brooklyn [New York City, New York].  But you had a story about how you got involved in NAACP in the first place.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You said Dave--David Muss had a conversation with you, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  David Muss said to me, because at that time you had the NAACP, the Urban League, and C.O.R.E. [Congress of Racial Equality] was very strong.  And then--and Muslims were out there, you know, Malcolm [X] was out, you know it was a lot of--there were a lot of Black Nationalist organizations around Harlem [New York City, New York] competing for the marketplace.  So David Muss says to me, "Lee, I'm a Jew so I, I know some of this stuff that you go through.  Although I was born in Cape Town, South Africa."  He said, "You must join an organization that the white man knows about.  You wanna get ahead."  And he said, "I would suggest that you join the NAACP.  The white man knows what that is and safe organization."  So I was living in Brooklyn [New York City, New York].  I went over and became a member of the Brooklyn chapter NAACP  And worked hard there, you know, met some great folks there.  Met Earl Graves there.  As I said, Shirley Chisholm was there.  She was at that time was a professor at Columbia University [New York City, New York], she hadn't run for Congress yet.  A lot of significant folks.  At that time, the Brooklyn branch was the largest in the country.  And that's where I truly learned my whole Civil Rights approach.  I was chairman of the Labor Committee, and then I became chairman of the Five Burroughs Housing Committee.  I also became sort of a protege of Roy Wilkins.  I think I have a photograph here with him.  So Roy Wilkins became my living black role model.  I saw him as a, a much more conservative type of leader.  Very practical, very stern, and I knew and got a chance to know Roy Wilkins because I was a friend of Mollie Moon, that's a big name in New York [City, New York].  Henry Lee Moon was the public relations director for the NAACP at that time.  And of course Mollie was his wife.  And Mollie was the founder of the Urban League Guild.  That's where just wives, where you have large fundraiser for the Urban League.  So that join, now I'm joined between the Urban League and the NAACP.  And during that time, most of your middle class blacks were involved with the NAACP and the Urban League, or one or the other.  And a lot of times both.

Speaker 1: Now did, did you have any thoughts in those days about [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and, and, and SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and, or, or SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and what they were doing?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't see Dr. King as the way folks see him today.  You know you got a man, he was twenty-six years old.  I was in junior high school.  He was still in Montgomery [Alabama] when I got to Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama].  We didn't see Coretta [Scott King].  I mean Coretta wasn't really part of the black middle class there.  The college women ran Montgomery.  And there's a book about--have you seen the book The Women Behind the Montgomery Bus Boycott [sic, 'Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Women Who Started It: The Memoir of Jo Ann Gibson Robinson,' Jo Ann Robinson]?  Another story.  I'm jumping for just a second.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dr. Dave Garrow who was at N.Y.U. [sic, City College of New York, New York, New York] at the time, wrote "Bearing the Cross" ['Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,' David J. Garrow], which won the 1986 [sic, 1987] Pulitzer Prize [Biography or autobiography], writing about King.  He went around the country interviewing everybody who had been involved with the Montgomery bus boycott, and ended up coming to Sears, Sears Tower to interview me.  And I said to him everybody talks about Martin Luther King, they talk about--I forget the fellow there that was part of the unions.  Dixon.
Speaker 1: E, E, E. D. Nixon [Edgar Daniel Nixon].
Speaker 2: E. D. Nixon.  I said but no one talks about Jo Ann Robinson who--English teacher out at Alabama State [College, later Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama].  I said the women really controlled that thing and was doing everything.  Because the--you know, the white males didn't listen to any black males on anything in Montgomery [Alabama].  And Dr. Garrow said, you're correct.  He said when I--she's in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] now, she's retired.  He said, "When I met her, the first thing she did was go to her trunk and pull out a manuscript that was thirty years old."  Now this was twenty years ago.  He said, he said "My goodness, I gotta go through this."  He said once folks know you're writing a book, everybody has a manuscript.  He said when he read the first paragraph, he knew he had a gold mine.  You see she was the secretary.  She, she was the one person, only person that kept notes of everything that happened with the Montgomery bus boycott.  The other, other person that had good notes was [Ralph] Abernathy.  He got his master's in Atlanta [Georgia] writing about the boycott.  He had some good notes.  And I have a copy of his thesis.  He, he said he had to have her papers published.  The University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee] published her papers.  It's called The Women Behind the Montgomery Bus Boycott [sic, 'Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Women Who Started It: The Memoir of Jo Ann Gibson Robinson' Jo Ann Robinson].  And, and it's all documented, dates and stuff when, when--what the white women were doing and how they worked with Martin Luther King.  It, it's not taking anything away from King, it's like when everybody talks about [W.E.B.] Du Bois and don't mention the contributions of [Booker T.] Washington.  'Cause I, you know it, it's that kind of thing.  'Cause I often say the only thing most folks know about Du Bois, is he criticized Washington.  If you ask them something else he wrote in 'The Souls of Black Folk,' [W.E.B. Du Bois] folks don't even know what else he wrote in Souls of Black Folk.  They just know what he said about Washington.  So, so that's the other side of that whole movement, the women behind.  And I, I was buying 'em and giving 'em to folks.  They say what, we never knew anything about this.
Story_ID: 604745
Speaker 1: [David] Muss was telling me to join NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I go to Brooklyn [New York City, New York], I join.  And, and got involved.  I volunteered forty hours a week after work at the Brooklyn NAACP  I worked more than any other board member there.  That's how I became vice president.  I mean when I got involved with something--and on the labor committee, I integrated the night shift of blacks working in the banks in New York City [New York].  Because being in corporate America at that time, I was (unclear) Muss.  And represent the NAACP, and I went to Wall Street.  And I said we would like some jobs.  And I had a--sort of developed a relationship with a black vice--I mean a white vice president there.  And I learned later everything is, is based on relationship.  You know it's gotta be a click.  He said we have plenty--he said, "We have no trouble hiring folks for day time jobs."  He said, "We have trouble finding qualified folks to work our night shifts."  So I took that on.  And, and he said to me, "Now I don't wanna hear about you selling jobs," you know.  I said, "We'd never do that."  And so--
Speaker 2: So that was a--I mean to say that implies that somebody was doing that.
Speaker 1: Probably was.
Speaker 2: Had you ever heard anybody selling jobs like that?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  I didn't know any other.  Richard Clarke, that was the name I was trying to think of.  Richard Clarke was the first national headhunter.  Very prominent in New York.  He had an office in Rockefeller Center.
Speaker 2: This is a, this is a black man and, and-
Speaker 1: Black man.  Richard Clarke and, and [HM] John [H.] Johnson were the only two black businesses in, in Rockefeller Center in, in, in the early '60s [1960s].  And you see I just started hiring you know, women to work the night shift.  And that made more folks come into the Brooklyn chapter.  We got larger, you know, that took out memberships.  And then I left, and I will use one company, go to another company you know, to say you know the Brooklyn branch can get you qualified folks to work.  So that was a project I sort of developed.  And that's how I really got involved.  Like I said, then I met Mr. [Roy] Wilkins.  'Cause after Whitney [Young] had got us all started, we met at the National Urban League our C.C.B.E. [Council of Concerned Black Executives].  But when we became A.I.M. [Association for the Integration of Management], we had our own office where we'd have our meetings.  Or we would meet, since I was chairman, we would meet on Saturdays in the corporate board room of Sears [& Roebuck Co.].  That was a little too liberal for Sears, a little too racist.  'Cause I had one meeting in the executive conference room on Saturdays.  And the guy, head of operating, didn't like that.  You know he said, "We can't have these blacks coming here on Saturdays."  So they said, "Lee if you wanna come in, you have to meet in the cafeteria."  I said, "Hell with that," you know.  And we met at one of--well we rented a conference room, you know there in Penn Station, but we had an office there.  And my treasurer was Mollie Moon's son-in-law, Garland Woods [sic, Garland Wood].  Now we had to choose a white mentor, it was part of our strategy.  We didn't say a white to choose us.  We said we gonna choose a white.  And whether he knows it or not, we're gonna watch him, we're gonna analyze him.  We're going know everything about this guy.  At this point Winston-Muss [Corporation] was in the, you know top one thousand.  And with A.I.M. our goal was to be within the top ten.  And Sears was number six.
Story_ID: 604746
Speaker 1: I mean the members of the organization [Association for the Integration of Management, AIM] wanted to work for a top ten corporation is what you're saying.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so you know and the other fellows were with large corporations.  I was the only one with a small outfit.  So then I put my resume out.  Chrysler made me an offer, but they wanted me to handle their minority supply thing.  I didn't, no.  It would be like Clarence Thomas there where when he--he at corporate law and they wanted him, you know, to do something else.  So I turned Chrysler down.  And turned other companies down.  I got to, got to Sears.  And Sears [Roebuck & Co.] wanted me to go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], work my way up from the field.  And I said to him, I said, "No, no, I'm not coming to Philadelphia."  I said, "I, I worked hard to get to New York [City, New York], and I'm gone give up New York for Philadelphia?"  But I, I also left out when I went to Sears in Philadelphia.  When they wrote me a letter say they wanna talk to you.  When I met the vice president, I opened the conversation up.  I said, "So I save myself some time and save you more of your valuable time," I said, "I wanna tell you, you know I didn't come here to take one of your nigger jobs."  Said right away.  He said, "Lee, I'm glad you said that."  He said, "We don't have any of them nigger jobs here."  He said, "But I'm a vice president, and there are five of us, and we all wanna go up."  He said, "As long as you know that you're not gonna get there before me, we can talk."  I said, "Okay."  I said, "But I'm not coming to Philadelphia."  He said, "All right."  He said, "We'll keep talking."  Little did I know he had hired a black fellow out of New York to come to Philadelphia.  And he called the personnel director of Sears in New York.  He probably said, "Hey, you gave me a black, now I can pay you back.  I'm gonna send you a black that's right there in New York."  So the V.P. [vice president] in Philadelphia called me and said, "Lee, you called Winfield Ferman [ph.] personnel director of New York office (unclear) office, and he's gonna put--he said when you call and say my name is Lee Walker, he's gonna pick up the phone" because I had--I had gone to this color thing with him; we had developed a relationship that we wasn't gonna B.S. [bullshit] with one another about stuff, you know I'm looking for a serious job.  And to test him, I said I'll wait a week and then I'll call the New York office.  I waited a week, called the New York office.  I said, "It's Lee Walker calling Winfield Ferman."  Ten seconds, Ferman picks up the phone.  He said, "Lee, we thought we lost you."  He said, "Why don't you come over and let's talk?"  So meanwhile I'm working for, for Winston-Muss [Corporation].  They made me a nice offer.  They said trainee.  I said I'm not a trainee.  I said I'm not a trainee.  I said no.  They said, "You gotta train and we'll start you off here."  I said, "Wait a minute."  I said, "I'm a corporate executive already."  I said, I said--and I was different from the mold that Sears was hiring because they were coming out of what we call the field, the retail stores.  And here I was coming from outside of retailing.  And he said, "Well we don't wanna put you in buying first, Lee."  He said, "Why don't you take oper--operating?"   I said, "I tell you what.  I wanna come to you, but not in operating.  I want buying first.  If I fail there, I'll go to operating."  I succeeded in buying.
Speaker 1: Now what, what year is this?  This is--
Speaker 2: This is 1970 now.
Story_ID: 604747
Speaker 1: Now you had, before we move on, you had a--we were--du--during the break you were, you were talking--you were giving a critique of affirmative action and the way it worked and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I, I, I was giving a critique of affirmative action.  When it initially happened, we all benefitted, I benefitted.  I think every corporate black out there.  Because at that point, the folks who were benefitting initially I would say were blacks going into corporate America, blacks who were trying to get federal contracts.  You know that, that's what was out there.  It wasn't about I suppose getting a job at Macy's.  I mean Adam Clayton Powell had done that deal long before when blacks, you know couldn't go into restaurants on 125th Street.
Speaker 1: In their own neighborhood, yeah.
Speaker 2: See folks forget about blacks had been fighting to get low level jobs long before affirmative action, you know, picketing, all that kind of stuff.  But initially I said we were having racial problems in corporate America and getting contracts, etc., to move beyond "The Spook That Sat By the Door".  And so the cor--you had the federal thing for, for government jobs.  And on a corporate side, it was equal opportunity.  I think that was the slogan, equal opportunity commission or something like that.
Speaker 1: E.E.O.C. [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission].
Speaker 2: Equal opportunity employer I think.
Speaker 1: E.E.O.C.  I mean well it was equal opportunity employer, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because they hadn't established the agency yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See it was still an executive order under [President John F.] Kennedy at, at this time.  And we said it has changed.  It's no longer a racial remedy.  Now it's white women.  And my view was as chairman, white women have suffered from a lot of things, but nothing racially unless they couldn't pass, too dark to pass, okay.  And I used Jews as an example.  I said when you hear the word anti-Semitism, you don't think of the Italian or the Greeks nor the Irish.  You only think of one group of folks.  And I said the Jews do not bring any other ethnic white group who's catching hell from some white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.  Say hey, we'll--come under our umbrella.  We'll protect you.  They don't do that.  Is aid they--Jews know they have a unique problem as whites in the white world.  We as blacks have a unique problem as blacks in the white world.  And I said ours is racial.  And that racial umbrella must be a racial remedy, and it is no longer that.
Story_ID: 604748
Speaker 1: So I argued for affirmative opportunity.  And that was--I did a debate here [Chicago, Illinois] on the John Calloway Show ['Chicago Tonight'].  I and Richard Epstein, University of Chicago Law School [Chicago, Illinois], debated Heddi--I forgot she's white female, head of white women for the state, and a black here named Joe Williams who's a consultant in the construction industry, etc.  And I wrote in a city publication that what blacks should be asking for now is not affirmative action, but affirmative opportunity.  I said opportunity can be connected to the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution.  I said we want opportunity now.  I said we passed the door.  And the word ceiling hadn't come in, white women developed, you know, the glass ceiling.  I mean I don't--I mean we didn't even have a ceiling, hell, then.  So that was my argument with affirmative action.  And we did that with A.I.M. [Association for the Integration of Management] It was personal responsibility.  We had to prepare ourselves and where we found discrimination, our remedy was to sue.  Hey, I mean we talking about our futures here, you know.  And folks sue, I mean you know women sue, like--all these sexual harassment stuff, you know.  So I say it's an economic thing.  I don't think you can pass a law to make someone love you.  But, but if you, but if you put a cost to it, and being an economics major, like I said, I mean those things you tax, you get less of.  Those things you subsidize, you get more of.  And I'm saying--and there was not tax in my view, strong enough for, for discrimination.  And so--and I said you know then that can't be my remedy.  After saying that, I became a very good friend of Bill Wilson [William Julius Wilson] who was head of sociology at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I went public with the term affirmative opportunity here in a city publication.  I still have a number of them.  The following year in 1996, I said this here public in '95 [1995].  In 1996 Bill Wilson wrote a book, and did a whole chapter on moving from racial remedies to affirmative opportunity.  He went at it from an academic point of view and research.  I went at it from the way I had lived in the corporate world, my friends, we all talked about it, we knew what was holding us back.  'Cause we said to Whitney [Young], "Whitney you and Mr. [Roy] Wilkins are unaware of the problems that we're faced with."  I say, "You guys got us in the door.  But man, once we get inside, personnel tell us all these great stories.  And then they put us under a supervisor that you can't do no right."  I said you know, there is--"What kind of protection do you have from stuff like this?"  So I said we gotta find new remedies, and that's what A.I.M. was all about.
Story_ID: 604749
Speaker 1: And today some folks are--I think white Democrats in particular, can walk into a black church and control the black vote, just say affirmative action.  They don't describe it, what they're talking about.  And we say, "Hey, amen brother."  And I think that's wrong.  Like what do you mean by this?  And, and I said to [HM] Jesse Jackson, [John] Kerry didn't show any affirmative action in his campaign because 2004 Jesse was paying folks eight dollars an hour to hand out literature.  Kerry didn't give blacks any money, you know.  And Jesse will acknowledge they didn't call him until the last minute.  And [HM] Al Sharpton's out there right now, you know, trying to tear the Democratic party apart because of the way they're being treated right now.  So to me that's progress.  We're not being taken for granted right, right now by either party.  And I tell folks in a minute, don't be talking to me about George [W.] Bush because you know, I don't work for him, you know.  I'm not recruiting for the R.N.C. [Republican National Committee].  'Cause if I was good at it, I'd be on that payroll and I'm not.  And I have a right to be in one of the major parties.  We're the only ethnic group who is being--been the hind leg 100 percent in both major parties (unclear).  We were all Republicans at one time.  Now 90 percent of us are all Democrats and we're still bitching because we're--and I argue know what you want.  Jews are not bitching at both parties.  Jews are in power regardless of who is in the presidency.  I also argue folks never knew what party Whitney Young or Roy Wilkins belonged to.  They met with whoever's president.  This is nonsense here.  I've called for [HM] Julian Bond's resignation publicly.  I said he's destroying an organization.  He knows damn well he has, he has crossed the line.
Speaker 2: You think it's just too partisan for 'em.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And for a 501(c)(3), they can snatch it in a minute.  They do it to white organizations.  And, and don't tell me that--hell I mean Jesse follows the rules and nobody shut PUSH [People United to Save Humanity] down.  I mean Jesse criticizes the administration and everybody else.  When they catch him wrong, Jesse (unclear) go to his accountant or C.P.A. [certified public accountant], they straighten it out.
Story_ID: 604750
Speaker 1: Now what is--now, now you were with Sears [Roebuck & Co.] from 1970 until--
Speaker 2: I, I, I was at Sears from 1970 to May 31st, 1993.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What happened there, a new chairman came in after dropping fifty thousand people.  He came back to four thousand executives who had two things in common: age fifty and twenty years of service.  And if you, if you had that combination before May 31st, 1993, you could apply, change your mind back and forth.  And what it was, they added five years to your age, five years to your length of service, a lump sum payment and a year's salary.  And of course the New York Times many times ran stories about porters leave Sears with a quarter of a million dollars because of the stock.  I mean Sears forced you to, to become part of the stock plan.  And stock splits--I'd been there, you know on about two or three splits.  So I had numbers of, you know I had shares of stock, which I sold when I left and started my own firm without any foundation money or Republican money.  I invested 100 thousand dollars and I started the New Coalition as my full time job.  To--I felt that the--well I had--Sears had put me on--I was on their governmental affairs committee.  I'm jumping on you here now.  When I was transferred out here and they didn't want me out here.  They didn't want--it wasn't nothing, nothing to it.  It was Lee Walker.  They didn't--they--the Chicago [Illinois]--I discovered there's aversion between the Midwest and the East Coast.  And I started talking about Alabama because the headquarter Sears folks thought the New York [New York] was underworked and overpaid.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the New York crowd thought the Chicago folks didn't know when to eat their salad (laughter), you know, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 604751
Speaker 1: But we were talking about before we--we were talking about your retirement from Sears [Roebuck & Co.] in '93 [1993] and the formation of the New Coalition [for Economic and Social Change].
Speaker 2: Of the New Coalition (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And tell, tell me now did you start--did you form it yourself?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Come up with the idea?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  The idea is twenty-five years old.  I, I was--it was started by Thomas Sowell who's out at Hoover [Institution, Palo Alto, California] right now.
Speaker 1: Sowell, yeah, S-O-W-E-L-L.
Speaker 2: And I have his photograph here too.  He named the organization.  From this town I think [HM] Eugene Dibble [III], Clark Burrows.  In 1980, a group said the black community is too monolithic in its thinking and politically, socially.  Stuff is going hell in a wastebasket.  We got to channel this (unclear) welfare leadership coming out of the black community.  That was the reason for holding the conference at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco [California].  A book was published describing it.  The 1982--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the book and what was--
Speaker 2: 'The Fairmont Papers.' [The Fairmont Papers: Black Alternatives Conference, Thomas Sowell et al]
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the conference?
Speaker 2: The Alternative Conference was the name of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Give you that.  The, the 1982 Urban League State of Black America paid Chuck Hamilton [Charles V. Hamilton] who used to teach--Chicago [Illinois] boy who used to--
Speaker 1: Charles, Charles V. Hamilton.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was one of the founders of this group. [HM] Chuck Stone, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], was part of this group of, of that we're gonna build new leadership in the black community.  That was--that's how Clarence Thomas was there.  Walter Williams was there, Tony Brown.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is--
Speaker 2: This is 1980.
Speaker 1: 1980.  Just elected--
Speaker 2: [Ronald] Reagan.
Speaker 1: Ronald Reagan, president.
Speaker 2: From, from here also was Milton Freidman was there, Ed Meese was there.  You, you will see in my book here I acknowledged Ed Meese at a meeting as, as being there when we started this organization.  The, the first person you, you heard from was Clarence Pendleton who became the first black chair of the Human Rights Commission.  He was our first employee.  Jim Lowry [HM James Lowry] from this town was also there.  And I was the Chicago chairman.  I was to set up an organization representing the organization right here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now did [HM] Lu Palmer participate?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  No.
Speaker 1: Now I'm pretty sure [HM] Vernon Jarrett probably did not.
Speaker 2: No, I think the Chicago folks who knew about this I'd say was Eugene Dibble, [HM] Jewel Lafontant [Mankarious], as I say [HM The Honorable] Clark Burrus, trying to think of another black was at the bank.  Ham--goodness.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: He reported to Clark.  Chicago man.  Charlie Gaines, a former state legislature, and another guy who was shot, Armstrong.  He, he owned Metro Newspaper.
Speaker 1: Right, I know what you're talking--who you're talking about, yeah.
Speaker 2: Guy killed him 'bout his daughter.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) William. I think it was, what William Armstrong?
Speaker 2: He was Arm--I know he was Armstrong.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was William Armstrong.
Speaker 2: I forgot his name.
Speaker 1: Right--
Story_ID: 604752
Speaker 1: I didn't leave my job [at Sears, Roebuck & Co.] you know, to get involved.  I was on the national board.  And whole bunch of professors and community activists, Percy Sutton was there.  It wasn't a Republican thing.  But after a couple years, it went downhill because everybody took jobs, other folks died out.  And, and it was really a whole fight because the press saw us there to knock out the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the Congressional Black Caucus and that really wasn't the purpose.  And I was the only one that kept it alive in, in this town from, from all the other cities around the country.  We, we had a chapter in every major city.  And I kept it alive because of Sears paid for it.  I was on Sears' payroll and Sears liked the idea that you had a group of blacks interested in free marketplace.  And so when I got a chance to leave, I said you know to (unclear) and the folks, "Hey Lee, it's yours, you take it."  So I turned it into an Illinois 501(c)(3).
Speaker 2: Okay, is that when you named it the New Coalition [for Economic and Social Change]?
Speaker 1: This was the , this was the name, what it was twenty-five years ago.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I didn't change--the name is the same, the New Coalition for Economic and Social Change.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Economic change, what, what do you all mean by economic and social change?
Speaker 1: Just what it says.
Speaker 2: To change from what to what?
Speaker 1: Become part of the free market system.  Change what we're doing socially.  Like I said, depending on the federal government to solve all your problems.  Get inv--involved in choice schools, failing schools, all that, all that kind of stuff out there.  We gotta get off the bottom.  We gotta stop--get back to a whole self-reliance position here.  It, it was really what I call just old common sense.  How did--I mean the leadership group that made the '60s [1960s] possible you see, those folks dealt with diverse views.  I mean it wasn't a new idea.  It's the turn of the century.  The, the big debate was do we go back to Africa?  You see.  And of course [Frederick] Douglass wasn't one of those folks.  I mean the successful blacks who, who were in the marketplace did not wanna go back.  The folks who had failed, etc., and a couple of the middle class black, wanted to go to Liberia if you were from this country.  Or to Sierra Leone if, if you were over in Europe.  That was the debate.  You know.  So we solved that debate and now we're still in the debate between [W.E.B.] Du Bois and, and [Booker T.] Washington.  Everybody's going in the right direction, but it was the means.  Now I was pleased to hear Mor-Morial [HM the Honorable Marc H. Morial], the new head of the Urban League, he said in his 2005 State of Black America, blacks are about lose right now all the gains they made in the last forty years.  That was new, that was, that was revolutionary talk to come out of an, an organization like, like the Urban League.  I, I mean but it was time for someone at that level to say that.  And I'm waiting now to see what the new corporate guy from Verizon is going to do.  I don't think he's gonna be able to do too much because he has a sixty--
Speaker 2: No, NAACP--
Story_ID: 604753
Speaker 1: I don't see [HM] Bruce [Gordon] doing a hell of a lot because of a sixty member board and, and a chairman there that inside folk were telling me that [HM] Julian [Bond] is probably gonna be gone in two years.  Enough board members knows that he, he's now a liability to the organization.  But I asked Mr. [Roy] Wilkins, I said Mr. Wilkins when I was setting A.I.M. [Association for the Integration of Management], he knew all about it 'cause we, we had an N.B.A. interview, just he and I, that was published.  He said, "I said I wanna do what you would like to have done."  He said, "First of all, my board's too large."  And he said, "And you don't need a board that you don't have some control over."  And, and I, and I set up A.I.M. that way.  And when I set this up and was using my money, I didn't set it up where my board could take it from me.  Because I've seen too many white nonprofits bring folks on their board and within two or three years, they had voted the person who started out of the organization.  Now this is white I'm watching.  So I said Lee I'll do this with my money.  I'll choose, you know, my board members.  But the one thing I had the first meeting of the New Coalition [for Economic and Social Change] when I got here.  Jim Lowry [HM James Lowry] was there with me from here.  He still says to me, "You won't invite me into the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi], you won't invite me into the Guardsmen [National Association of Guardsman].  But I had my first meeting at Sears, governmental affairs.  Why did Sears do that for me?"  When I would walk down the hallway, the blacks would say, "That's him, that's him, that's that black Republican from New York [City, New York]."  What they didn't know, the folks on the sixty-eighth floor were all Republicans.  So they had one of their Democratic lawyers say, "We wanna meet this Lee Walker."  And that's how it all started.  At that time, Sears had two black vice presidents out here.  One was Gwen Laroche's brother, who married John Junior's father.  And the other guy they had, Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson], (unclear) and [HM] John [H.] Johnson (unclear) were two black V.P.s (vice presidents).  Harold Washington becomes mayor and he asks the business community to give him someone on loan to help develop his first budget.  Two white companies sent blacks.  Sears chose me and I think Skidmore and Owings chose a black.  Now there were other blacks in there, but I'm talking about corporations that sent someone.  And what I brought to the table was privatization.  Where did I get it from?  The Heritage Foundation.  Privatization was a whole new thing out there as a public policy.  I was responsible for streets and sanitation.  For another idea in enterprise zones.  I set up a conference with a national black accountant to discuss enterprise zones 'cause I said to them the civil rights organizations do not understand taxes, you guys understand taxes.
Story_ID: 604754
Speaker 1: All right, so we were talking about the formation of the New Coalition [for Economic and Social Change] and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  The, the--I learned from being on Sears Governmental Affairs Committee the importance of public policy.  You will see stuff here, I have in the White House.  I mean I was in the White House so many times under Reagan I thought I lived there.  And but what I learned was that I thought everybody at the White House, you know, was smart.  You know now you talking 'bout (unclear).  I said smart.  These folk got Ph.D.s.  They, they've written twenty books.  And you sit around here, the awe sort of moves away from you.  You know this is like going to work.  And it dawned on me, I said I got an idea better than that.  You know.  And you see these things put into policy.  You see folks vote for 'em.  You know as you saying, you know I have trouble with [George W.]Bush and the war here.  I'm saying [Tony] Blair, I like what--you know Blair is saying if I catch a church out here, I'm gone close the church down.  If I catch one of you folks here and you're now a British citizen, I'm gone throw you out, you know.  I said Bush is not doing that.  When we heard about [Muammar] Gaddafi, Reagan had bombed them already, you know.  And I'm saying here we are the jolly green giant with midgets out here, you know, just, just biting you know, all in the legs.  And you know you're losing your foot now, you know, so he's gotta stop this.  You know you gotta go in there, take the folks out.  During war, people die.  Do you know over 160,000 folks died when they dropped the atom bomb?  You know so I'm not for, you know for killing, but I understand folks die in wars.  But this little stuff that Bush is doing right now, I can tell you, boy I'm not pleased with it at all.
Speaker 1: Do you think he, maybe he's got the wrong target?  I mean (unclear) military energy--
Speaker 2: Personally, personally I think Bush is looking out for the top white power structure.  We know in research within the next thirty years, not a guess, a fact, China will be number one, U.S.A. (United States of America) will be number two, and India's number three.  We know this right now.  (Unclear) the street doesn't know this.  I mean that's gonna happen.  What China doesn't have, we have here is wealth development.  And what I mean by that, white folks in this country, you take the Rockefellers, the Vanderbilts and the McCormicks, that's money that generational, generational, generational.  That's wealth.  You see Oprah [Winfrey] is rich, okay.  [HM] John [H.] Johnson was rich.  But when you talk about three generations, four or five of wealth, that's why we're the richest country in the world.  You can do the research and all that kind of stuff.  China now is at that point, and they got the people and they got the talent.  I, I listened to a discussion where the president of the New York Stock Exchange said he had 1,400 programmers making 150,000 dollars a year.  Getting rid of all of 'em and used 30,000 dollars a year programmers in India.  They interviewed the guys there, said, "Don't you guys feel bad that in America they getting 150,000, over here you're getting thirty?"  They said, "No we do not feel bad.  We feel very good that we can show the world what we can do for less."  I said, "That's (unclear), you know."  When you know you're moving ahead--just last week I had a guy from India tell me how to correct my computer over the damn phone.  (Unclear) say, "Where you calling me from?"  He said, "India."  When you call Dell, you are calling India.  I have a friend who was the first black president of the Cardiology Association of Chicago [Illinois].  He said, "Lee when I do," what you call it, "cardiogram," he said, "It's read overnight in India and back on my desk the next morning."  The street doesn't know this.  You see so while we talk about 50 percent of the kids in Chicago are not graduating high school.  Another new daily you may know or may not know, right now three fourths of all the alumni of Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] are African or Caribbean offsprings.  Three fourths of all the blacks in all the Ivy League schools right now are African or Caribbean offspring.  And, and [HM] Henry Louis Gates [Jr.] and the guys have come up--this is their response.  Africans and Caribbean folks are not entitled to affirmative action with respect to admission to colleges.  This is how they're doing it.  I said boy you crazy.  I said students who study, pass tests.  That's the news fight going on right now.  You see while Hispanics in Illinois is--most--and I wrote about it in Crain's [Chicago Business News].  Most folks don't know that the Hispanics in the State of Illinois has changed the demographics.
Story_ID: 604755
Speaker 1: In terms--I mean how?
Speaker 2: In the numbers.  Illinois is the only Midwestern city that--in a ten year period brought in one million Hispanics.  Both black and white Hispanics, one million.  That changes the, that changes the demographics politically.  You got a school system here eighty-five percent black or more.  And I'm sitting there with [Richard M.] Daley and my assistant, and, and his educational assistant who communicates with him and the Board of Education, Hispanic lady, U.C.L.A. [University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  But yet the school system is eighty-five percent black, or almost--and probably eighty-seven.  You got a black now over Chicago United.  [HM the Honorable John H.] Stroger [Jr.] is not running the county, Daley's brother is.  And everybody who thinks [HM The Honorable] Jesse Jackson, Jr. or [HM The Honorable] Danny [K.] Davis gone be the next mayor, I'm saying it's a pipe dream.  The next mayor is gonna be Hispanic, just like L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  They--I forgot which state, I have to check my research.  We have a state doing experiment right now of giving illegal immigrants mortgages to help them become citizens.  Why you think they doing that?  The blacks have topped out and the whites have topped out in this country.  You see--
Speaker 1: In our case I don't think we've topped out.
Speaker 2: Yes, we've topped out.
Speaker 1: May have bottomed out.
Speaker 2: Academically.  You see I mean we will stay--those twelve percent, say the white population has topped out.  It's, it's that immigrant has taken over.  And I--well what I--the reason I was saying that, I think this is the group I think that [George W.] Bush is trying to leave in the best settings.  This is, this is just my viewpoint of knowing a little--few little things I got, know.  I don't have no pipeline, you know, to something.  But trying to understand what--I mean the Bushes, I mean look here.  This Bush here, his grandfather was a U.S. [United States] Senator, you know, that's wealth.  I mean he's probably not the first one that wasn't bright coming out of Harvard and Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], okay.  So, so that, you know I don't--you know but I do think he's concerned about when China takes over, where are we?  You see.  And this is my view why we're, while we talk about you know, Iran and all this other stuff.  I truly think he's trying to make sure that the wealth of this country and the folks who are running it, you know the trilateral commission decided that Jimmy Carter gone be president.  Not the people.  We knew about Jimmy Carter overnight.  The research shows that the country was becoming conservative.  It was Democrats' time and they had to find a Democratic president.  And, and, and it be from the south.  [George] Wallace had proven that it was taken a, a conservative attitude coming in.  He got shot.  So The Trilateral Commission picked [James Earl] Jimmy Carter.  That's another group with the money.  Like the, like the Carlyle Group, you see, that Bush, Senior's [George H. W. Bush] a part of.  So overnight you know we learn about Jimmy Carter.  So folks, black folks don't wanna accept this--the country, well the country was built as a conservative country.  They did a whole bunch of bad things, then [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt came in with fifty years.  It's a, it's a rota--it's a rotating cycle I would argue.
Speaker 1: Now when you--
Story_ID: 604756
Speaker 1: What's your, your definition of--between conservative and being liberal?  Now what would be liberal?
Speaker 2: I mean be--I mean before we get to that, let's understand that the, the wheel is turning and we'll come back and, and define all that.  You see there is no question with any academic, well not the academics because--I mean liberals are running academia right now.  And, and experts will acknowledge that and basically by women, even seminaries.  But we had fifty years of free market thinking.  Our country went down, you know the crash, all this stuff had come you know, in, in the '30s [1930s].  We needed what Roosevelt did in the '30s [1930s].  I don't--no one would argue with that, okay.  So now the fifty year cycle, we're seeing that a lot of the stuff was good, and a lot of the stuff was bad.  For instance, welfare was bad for the black community because we didn't listen to Pat Moynihan [Daniel Patrick Moynihan] forty years ago when Pat Moynihan said, "I'm looking at data that's showing thirty percent of the black folks right now, their family structure is breaking up and nobody's paying any attention to it."  What did the black academics and white liberals say?  He's a racist.  Didn't pay any attention to Moynihan.  Now we're paying for it.  Instead of be--instead of it being 30 percent, now it's close to 70 percent.  So, so we pay the girl every time she had a baby, we paid her more.  We paid her to keep a man out of the house.  That's a bad policy.  And I argue with the, with the white scholars.  You knew it would do that.  Great Britain had--the only reason so--the only reason welfare was sixty-two years old, it had failed in Great Britain.  They were worried about the poor white folks.  What did we do?  And they discovered in Great Britain the more they gave, the numbers grew larger.  And then Milt Freidman [Milton Freidman] looked at that and put a little oil around it.  Those things you tax, you get less of, those things you subsidize, you get more of.  So Great Britain got rid of welfare and (unclear).  They were trying to--what do we do with all these poor white folks in Liverpool [Great Britain] was coming around.  So--and got to remember now [Ronald] Reagan didn't get rid of welfare.  I quote/unquote, black president got rid of welfare.  [William Jefferson] Bill Clinton got rid of welfare.  People are talking--who passed N.A.F.T.A. [North American Free Trade Agreement]?  Not, not [George W.] Bush, Bill Clinton passed N.A.F.T.A.  You know right now "Leave no Child Behind." [sic. "No Child Left Behind"]  Folks think it's Bush.  Clinton, that was one of Clinton's ideas.  But, but most black folks don't know that.  Most black folks think Bush came up with "No Child Left Behind."  So they gotta fight it.  What I got angry about for the first time in history you had a black secretary of education, you got a black from Chicago [Illinois] who's head of the largest teacher's union, and those two brothers couldn't get together to make sure that black kids can get a quality education.
Story_ID: 604757
Speaker 1: Now, the criticism I've heard is that there's no--the program [No Child Left Behind] was started, but there's no funds to support the components of the program.
Speaker 2: I've heard that.  I've heard that, and that's been a Democratic talking points.  What they're not telling you is that before this law, you didn't know you had failing schools.  No one acknowledged it, you know.  This is what's, this is what's filling up jails, for uneducated white folks to have jobs, okay.  I mean if, if a community is not educated, that community is a slave.  I told the kids yesterday you're going to high school now.  The research says whether it's college, junior high school or high school, the students forget what they've heard before they leave the, the auditorium.  They forget who the speaker was.  I want you to ask yourself one question. Why should I go to high school?  And if you can't come up with an answer why you should go, let me give you a response.  If you don't have an education, you're gonna be somebody's slave.  Now how many in here wanna be slaves?  Raise your hand.  No hands went up.  I said, "Good.  I know you're all are going to high school."  I know that 2,800 kids come out of jail almost every week.  Where they, where they coming?  My neighborhood.  I can tell you [Richard M.] Daley sent a whole bunch out, out in my neighborhood, out Burr Ridge way.  And the white instructors are going crazy out there 'bout these kids.  And I talked to Daley, but I told Daley I couldn't understand why his white corporate guy at AT&T [American Telephone and Telegraph], who's head of the school board, allowed his board to vote unanimously for kids in the third grade can read and can't do arithmetic, you pass them to the fourth.  I say, I say--you know what Daley said to me?  He said, "Lee there was no response."  No, he said, "There was no outcry."  That's what he said.  Then he tells me, he said, "Lee I know Illinois."  What he meant in my view, "I know the black folks here."  He said when I was in high school, he said, "Middle class blacks did not go to the public system."  He said middle class blacks went to Catholic schools and private schools.  That's what Daley said.  I said, "Well I think there's no outrage because most of the teachers in the public system, their kids are not in the public system, most of them.  That's why there's no outcry."  But I'm saying I was interested in your point before, who's going to help them?  And I'm saying we have to.  I do my bit by going over to the bad boys' school.  It's an individual thing.  It was only one Moses, you know.  And I think [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was our last single leader.  So, so--and as I say this on the circuit, I was pleased with all the calls that came in last night.  They wanted to know--
Speaker 1: When you were on the radio last night, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They, they wanted to know how many other blacks think like what you're saying?  You know, and one white guy called in and he said, "Listen, I'm not an educated white male.  But I make a damn good living as a construction worker.  I live in a nice neighborhood."  He said, "But what I can't understand is that the unions," he said, "I'm a union man, the unions are keeping blacks from learning trades so they can make a living like I'm making without a whole bunch of college degrees."  He said, and he said, "Nobody's saying anything about it."  He said, "What do you guys say about it?"  That's a hell of a question.
Story_ID: 604758
Speaker 1: You, you were talking about us needing new leadership and you, you were on the radio last night.
Speaker 2: Yes, Milt Rosenberg show ['Extension 720'], which is the number one show in, in the city [Chicago, Illinois], high ratings.  But, but his question you know, it really--and all three of us addressed that.
Speaker 1: Tell us about the man who, who--about the unions.
Speaker 2: Yes.  You see the response was he describing discrimination.  And discriminations against the law.  You see and, and I told him that what's wrong with that whole scenario is personal responsibility.  I say we have a construction organization here who's down there tying up traffic.  If you don't get X number of blacks on the, on the construction project, go after the unions as well you see.  Why is it only--I think it's about no more than three or four licensed plumbers in all--black in all Chicago [Illinois].  You--there's no more than--
Speaker 1: There's more than that.
Speaker 2: Not licensed plumbers.  I had a job for a 100,000 dollars for two years working with C.P.S. [Chicago Public Schools], and my job was matchmaking.  My job was to match up a black sub with, with a white general contractor.  You don't have them--you don't have them in the plumbing area.  And they're not in the union.  And electrical, I think the only black on--you have one black on, on the union's committee in electrical and he's a brother, can't think of his name, he put up the lighting on State Street.  He had an office on South Michigan.  And you probably only have about--you don't even have five black electrical folks, contractors in the union.  I said to Walsh, I, I brought them all into my office one by one.  I said you guys know how many black subcontractors are in this city.  I said Walsh one of you guys could hire every black subcontractor in Chicago, and he wouldn't have to worry about this whole, this whole thing.  But it's payola in there that, that they pay folks ten percent to use their name.  They had a white boy from my hometown, Burr Ridge [Illinois] that's going to jail.  This guy was in the paper with the Sun Times (unclear) a couple of weeks ago, 100 million dollars talking about it was a minority firm and it wasn't, you know, it was his mother.  One hundred million dollars.  Not one black contractor in town has, has gotten that money, that much, that much business.  Also--
Speaker 1: You're talking about the Duffs [James M. Duff].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Duffs, D-U-F.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Duffs, they live in Burr Ridge.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: A hundred million dollars, saying--
Speaker 1: Janitorial company.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They really never done that kind of work before; they just hired people to be janitors and clean up after Chicago--City of Chicago.
Speaker 2: There was no minorities.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I'm saying first of all you gotta stop these blacks from being fronts.
Speaker 1: Yeah in their case though, it was their mother.  They used her as a minority as a woman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I'm talking about there are no secrets out there in that construction industry, okay.  There are no secrets out there.  Everybody know what's going on.  And then you've got the factoring I discovered, the city and the state can bankrupt a small black subcontractor because they don't pay them at the end of the week, end of the month.  At the same time, got a work ethics problem.  That's why Hispanics are replacing so many blacks.  Not that blacks don't want the jobs.
Story_ID: 604759
Speaker 1: And this bounces back to the personal responsibility issue that Bill Cosby raised and others raised about that, that--I think only maybe in the--at the family level are you gonna be able to cure that kind of problem.  I mean no matter what the cause is, there are many causes.  But at the family--
Speaker 2: It's a family problem.
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to solve it at the family level.  Some--there's gonna be training the parents or re-training the somebody because it's--
Speaker 2: One white scholar wrote a book who wants to save the young black kids, is talking about take 'em away from their parents.  You gotta get 'em out of the community.  And again I thought about pre-Civil War when a group of white folks got together and say let's send 'em back to Liberia and, and Sierra Leone.  There was a whole debate.  And now the white corporate structure knows unless we educate more blacks than we're doing, we won't have the employees.  [Michael H.] Moskow, head of Federal Reserve for this region, said Chicago can't grow any faster than it's growing because they don't have the qualified employees.  One of the things that you don't hear talked about when you listen to [Donald] Rumsfeld talk and you listen to those generals talk about the training of the troops and stuff and what's happening over there.  What Raingeld [ph.] is not mentioning, who do you think volunteer for the [U.S.] Army the most, or Military service?  Who do you think--who--what ethnic group you think is the largest group of volunteers?
Speaker 1: Probably black people.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And are those folks who are volunteering, are they college graduates?  Okay, they not, right?  Now you gotta a war going on, you know.  A crazy war, you know.  McDonald's had to come up and, and Kentucky [Kentucky Fired Chicken]fried--all this stuff, Popeye, they had to come up with emblems so these folks can know which cash register to press because the cash register break, they can't give you correct change, okay.
Speaker 1: A picture of a burger.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  So we got a whole bunch of black folks over there, they don't have time to train those folks to do some of the stuff they need to be doing.  And, and, and our blacks are afraid to touch it.  See that's my job to listen and read, read between the lines and what they're saying.  Everybody's saying, "Why can't we train 'em faster?"  You know you don't have enough people over there.  What they're really saying, you don't have enough people over there that can read and write.
Speaker 1: So they were saying we've lost maybe eighteen years of education.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: To have been there, it's hard to put it back in.
Speaker 2: Look here.  You see it was okay for these, for these kids drop out of high school and go in the [U.S.] Military until this, until this war, until 9-1-1 [September 11].  We were at peace, so it's no big deal.  Kids go in there, stay twenty years and come out and get an education, some of them.  But, but god knows now we need them.  And, and that's the kiss of death, you know.  Rumsfeld is not gonna say that.  But some of the folks are saying it.  So, so, you know but it's--education is the key for us right now.  Not affirmative action, education.
Speaker 1: But don't you think--
Speaker 2: To me education-Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], all the Ivy League schools right now are giving to, to keep from being sued, they give you a damn free ride.  Harvard say I don't care how much money your family make, pass the damn test, we gone let you in.  And everybody now is, is based--given a, a written test because that's--a written test is not biased.  You write (unclear), you know.  Don't answer our questions.  You gotta a half an hour to write 250 words on anything you wanna do.  And, and I've been on the board of higher education, the community college board.  I've been involved with Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois] and I can tell you I don't see how some of those folks are coming out of Chicago State.  I wouldn't hire them in my office.  And they got a, and they got a four year degree.  I wrote down on a piece of paper, I told my wife a very prominent woman from the [Chicago] Board of Education yesterday, she was speaking at, at the graduation.  And she said don't you forget it, don't you forget it, kids.  I said my god.  You know.  You got to handle the English language.
Story_ID: 604760
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you about this in terms of Republicans and Democrats and blacks and whites in the City of Chicago [Illinois], you know it's well known that Chicago is a Democratic town.  Go to the City Council, there are no Republicans in the City Council.
Speaker 2: There's no Republicans.
Speaker 1: Zero.  That used to shock people.  I used to ask (unclear).
Speaker 2: But it's--but, but, but I--you're gonna see a change.  The Congressional Black--I had white folks paying me to speak to black folks.  Last week I was in Boston [Massachusetts] at the Ritz Carlton Hotel, a retreat for the senior staff of the Congressional Black Caucus, the National Urban League, the N.A.A.C.P. [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Giving this retreat was sponsored by the Mercatus Center, which is a think tank--part of George Mason University [Fairfax, Virginia].  They looked at my Web page and he called me and said we'd like to--you to be part of our retreat group of instructors.  I looked at the, you know I look at the line-up and I saw I was the only person there with no PhD.  And we're talking about economics in the marketplace.  And since they're paying, expenses and that kind of stuff, you know, (unclear) travel.  And I wanted to see what's about the Congressional Black Caucus.  I had my view that here's a chance now to talk to real people, you know, for a week.  And my views did change.  I discovered the senior staff are mostly female, not male.  And in Gillette is paying for this.  This, you know, a group of folks have discovered the Congressional Black Caucus is not as effective as it could be.  And if it understood capitalism better, they would be able to do a much more effective job with respect to the free marketplace.  Said let 'em stay Democrat.  We ain't trying to change you, but you must understand that if communi--I mean Russia tried its best to prove that communism and socialism would work.  Karl Marx was a great economist, but it didn't work.  And I mean what works now is our mixed economy, what we have here.  And, and that's where it's going.  And I enjoyed talking to those folks; I came away with a lot of friends.  But they wouldn't have hired me.  I never would have got a chance to speak to them, I never would have been chosen.  But here the white group, they didn't know me.  You know they just, they just looked out there, trying to find someone that's talking about diverse views.  And I--and that's all over my Web page, you know.  Diverse views.  The reason [HM] Jesse Jackson keeps bringing me on his show fist to argue, I know his rating goes up when I'm on the show.  And Jesse's going into thirty-five million households around the country.  And I must say he's doing a hell of a job.  And, and my view of Jesse has changed; he's very bright, no question about it.  I've watched him.  I've watched--these whites on television, they're reading script.  Jesse's not reading.  I'm watching him, you know.  I was on a commission with John Johnson [HM: John H. Johnson].  God, I mean John Johnson--I told him, I say Mr. Johnson, how do you do it?  We had to, we had to read resumes to choose your rewards to federal employee.  I was, I was reading fast.  Man, John Johnson was--he could suck up a page.  He's a bright guy.  Well like I say, he was at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] and University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  He didn't graduate, but he was there in two smart schools.  So you know he, he wasn't dumb.  And I'm saying this guy made it without any affirmative action, without banks lending any money; he took a chance.  He saw a need.  He proved Booker Washington right.  You do something well, the marketplace will, will repay you.  Folks say well [HM] Colin Powell was affirmative action.  Colin  Powell's not affirmative action.  What happened was Clifford Alexander, Jr. was secretary of the Army.  And the, and the white generals kept, you know gotta give him a list every year who's gonna make general.  And the first list, there were no blacks on there.  So no, you know, go back.  Bring it back to me again.  Second time, no blacks.  He had to tell him, you mean to tell me we don't have a black in the U.S. [United States] Military that's ready to be a general?  And they came up with Colin Powell.  Again, a West Indian background.  And, and I, and, and I can tell you, my wife will tell you.  Colin Powell--what didn't come--he, he graduated a high school that most West Indians would never even go to.  He was not, he wasn't a smart kid.  He went to one of the dumbest schools in the, in the Bronx [New York, New York].  So, but, but what he did have was family values and, and behavior, you see.  And that's now where--what shining now over American blacks and myself, you know.  I, I, I, you know I got my wife, I said I'm wearing a, a West Indian bangle here.  My second term, said Mr. Walker you haven't pulled your wife's bangle off yet?  I said well I've gotten sort of accustomed to it.  I said so when I, when I run to the West Indian, they won't shoot me or something.  I make a joke about it.  But I tell you, I just put it on, I enjoyed it.  That's the only reason I'm wearing it.  But I am aware of the statistics.  And while I'm off the subject, that was my really reason for wanting to get over here.  Because I argued that no comprehensive history of the black community is gonna be total if conservative thought is eliminated or ignored.
Story_ID: 604761
Speaker 1: Because all of our leaders have come from that conservative thought position, all of 'em, you, you name 'em.  I ain't talking about this 1960 Civil Rights crowd, the [HM] Jesse Jacksons of the world, you see, or, or the Lee Walkers of the world.  You know I, I mean you, you reach back into history and, and you look at who our (unclear).  Shirley Chisholm was the first person to run for, for president as a black.  The feminist movement of, of black women didn't, didn't surround her.  But again, she's a West Indian.  So what--in this town you may be aware of it.  A group of blacks from Nigeria own a cab company running around town.  A group of blacks from Ghana own a cab company running around town.  Why haven't some American blacks put their money together with a cab company?  They got jitney stuff running around on the south side.
Speaker 2: [HM]Herman Roberts had, had a black cab, cab company.
Speaker 1: Two African guys, two African from two African countries.
Speaker 2: You know I said Herman Roberts had a cab company.  Herman Roberts of Roberts Motels had a cab comp--company at one time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but as (unclear) I say these guys just started this recently.  I mean Crain did a whole story on them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They just got here, you see.  And, and, and they took passengers around undercutting the white cab companies and now white folks don't know the damn difference.  They just see the cabs, you know, running, and the guys going all over.  That's probably why that guy passed my--passed this office right here, you know.  I mean he wasn't American, you know, black, you know driving the cab.  When I said, you know when I said talking about the address.
Speaker 2: Now we were talking off camera in the beginning I asked you about some of the--you were telling me that you have some disagreements.  You do not--while you were saying all black conservatives I guess are not in--alike.
Speaker 1: No, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: The difference between, say Ward Connelly and Armstrong.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just like you're a Democrat and there are Democrats that you will identify with.  So it's nothing, it's nothing unique, you know.  You got, you know you got three or four different Baptist churches.  So that's why I say I'm for diverse views.  You know two heads are better than one.  If all black Democrats, you know, don't kiss each other, why should all conservatives kiss, kiss each other?  You know that's all I'm saying.  My whole problem, we're discovering that there are a lot of blacks out there with conservative views.  It's just that they're listening to Jesse [Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] more.  Because the press goes to those two--see the press doesn't have time to find that there's a Lee Walker, they got deadline.  I need somebody to speak on this right now.  And they know Jesse's ready to speak on anything, and they like Jesse.  Now he's just one name.  But in every major city there's a name because newspaper reporters will call you if they discover you've given them good data.  You know they don't wanna lose their job.  So what happens is they take Jesse's word.  For instance when Fox said--made a statement about the Mexicans are taking jobs that blacks don't want.  Only two people responded in the paper, and it was on television.  Jesse and [HM Reverend] Al Sharpton.  Not neither one of those guys represent black America.  But those were the two guys--
Speaker 2: But, but who does, though?  I mean in terms of--
Speaker 1: I'm saying, I mean those were the only two guys who spoke nationally on, on, on President Fox statement.  You see the Urban League didn't say anything, N.A.A.C.P. [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] didn't say anything.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Congressional Black Caucus did, you know, so I'm saying Sunday morning television when they talking 'bout the news.  You tell me, I watch this.  You tell me the only blacks who show up on Sunday morning television will be now Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State.  Warren Williams who is a TV commentator, and whatever, and it used to be [HM] Colin Powell, but he's off now.  If it wasn't him, it was his son involved in something.  You don't have any black commentators on Sunday morning TV talk shows talking 'bout world affairs.  But yet we all know what's wrong with George [W.] Bush and how much he lied.  Well if we know so damn much about what's wrong with George Bush, why aren't we on the Sunday morning talk shows talking about it?  They don't, they don't call you.  See these are the things I'm saying that we're letting slip.
Story_ID: 604762
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?  Not that you haven't expressed some, you know, but we always ask this as a formal question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African community, if you can sum them up.
Speaker 2: No.  We need to give the community choice.  You see people are not stupid.  We think they are, we like to think they are, you know.  The Congressional Black Caucus now are no longer a monolithic group in how they vote.  And the reason they're no longer a monolithic because a number of them voted with [George W.] Bush.  Not because he had bought them, but because the demographics of their area has changed.  Now your, your, your black caucus with the exception of Detroit [Michigan], you know.  And just a tidbit, Detroit is the largest Democratic voting city in terms of black folks.  I mean Illinois is way down the line.
Speaker 1: It's not Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Chicago is way down the line.  We a little bit better than that.  But what's happening to the Congressional Black Caucus, they now like, like [HM the Honorable] Dorothy Tillman.  You see Dorothy Tillman wanted the projects to stay there because she knows she got some middle class blacks, she gonna be out of the city council, and that's my home girl.  I mean you, I mean, I mean she's quiet now.  I mean [Richard M.] Daley gave her a whole bunch of money so now she not talking about the slavery issue anymore.  I mean she's trying to get some more out.  I think there's a new deal coming in, a new company.  But the Congressional Black Caucus now, their districts have been re-district where they have white folks in it now and middle class blacks.  So that means now they gotta think a little bit differently about some issues before they say I'm just affirmative action, you know.  Now you, you got blacks out there wait a minute.  What else are you doing?  You got whites that's saying hey, you gotta get their vote.  So--and that's good--that, that's a good thing.  So I'm saying in this town black folks don't know what's going on.  That's, that's how [HM] John [H.] Johnson made Ebony a big deal and Jet.  That's why the Defender has a, a, has a, has a great opportunity here.  Folks don't have a choice here.  Daley said okay, I got 150 spots.  I can move kids out of bad schools.  Two parents show up.  The others don't even know about it, who's gonna tell 'em?  I mean the ward committeemen don't even get involved with it, you know.  You, you're dumb--you just keep voting me in, you know, that kind of stuff.  [HM] Jesse [Jackson], I told Jesse this.  They tried to keep Wal-Mart out from working because the unions don't want Wal-Mart in.  I mean if you listen to Jesse and his crowd, and I told him this, you would think that Wal-Mart pays white folks more money in the white neighborhoods, but when they come to the black neighborhood, they pay a lesser salary; they don't.  I'm saying if white folks can, you know can work for Wal-Mart in the white community, what's wrong with black folks for Wal-Mart in the black community?  But yet you had folks in the city council--oh no.  But the union said hey, we don't want 'em in, you know.  They anti-union.  But lucky enough one of the aldermen, you know, changed.  So I'm saying give folks a choice.  This is what they don't have.  Someone has to explain this to them 'cause the aldermen are not doing it.
Story_ID: 604763
Speaker 1: Yes, so that, that, that's my response to you.  It, it, it--we just have to--look at Reverend [James T.] Meeks.  You know I get concerned when preachers gotta become politicians.  Reverend Meeks does not represent a middle class community.  But he puts up a fifty million dollar church.  And I, you know I just discovered privately how he raised so much of the money that he had members using their own homes as mortgage--so he can get mortgages and stuff.  That's wrong.  And I didn't even get involved when, when the cops stopped him.  I can say the only time I've seen him on Sunday in a white shirt and tie is when the white police chief went to his church.  You know normally, you know he's preaching on Sunday morning in his dashiki.  You know and I don't know why he got out of the car for that to happen.  I mean I don't know why you would tell your driver to go around a cop when you see him stopped there.  And, and I'm sure with him coming from Bible school, he didn't have his white shirt and tie on.  And the big limousine, and then another one behind you and everybody jumping out of the car.  You know, is, is the white boy racist?  Could have been, but it had nothing to do with it.  I mean the cops take on the attitudes of, of the community they're working in.  It's wrong, but our leadership has to do that, you see.  Now overnight Reverend Meeks wanted to change the whole policy of when the cops stop you, what you say, who gets out of the car and who doesn't.  Now if he could pull together folks to do that, you could pull together the folks to say Mayor [Richard M.] Daley, we gotta clean up the schools.  Mayor Daley, we gotta clean up the crime.  You know and there's nobody marching around that.  But we got all upset.
Speaker 2: What do they do march about then?
Speaker 1: Not to get results.  I mean the, the marches are weak.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) they do, and they call for, you know they have press conferences.
Speaker 1: I, I, I mean but you gotta stick to it.  Those folks--you see they've been picketing this, this hotel on Michigan Avenue how many years now?
Speaker 2: That's the union picketing the Congress Hotel.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  How long they been doing it?  I mean look, we won in Montgomery [Alabama] because of the economic factor.  The buses in Mont--you know, eighty percent of the folks who rode the buses in Montgomery were black folks.  And the white folks who owned the bus said wait a minute, you know, (unclear) bucks, you know.  They were not paying their mortgages.  They said let's end this thing.  And fortunate enough, Supreme Court and the laws came on the same time.  But that was the first time in American history that you had 400,000 blacks to follow a straight line for thirteen months, the majority of 'em.  Not everybody, you know, but the majority of 'em.  You know to follow a twenty-six year old young fellow that you never heard of.
Story_ID: 604764
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done.  Now you've been a delegate to the Republican National Convention and so forth?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I have spoken at the Democratic [National] Convention.  I--when the Democrats were here [Chicago, Illinois], I participated.  Probably the first black Republican to do so on public policy issues.  I thought I was, I thought I was at a Republican thing.  They said give 'em hell Mr. Walker.  The Urban League came up with the questions, and I'm thinking of the young lady, you probably know her.  She used to be on the Johnson show [Ebony/Jet Showcase].  I think she's head of media now at City Colleges [of Chicago, Illinois], Deborah Crable.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Deborah was the moderator.  Jim Comfron [ph.] came up with the question to open up the envelopes.  I was winning so many of the arguments, Deborah Crable said, "I'm gonna take the prerogative of the chair and ask a question myself.  Would you--I would like to know what you folks think about affirmative action?"  Now that was to pull me out.  She knew what Clinton's folks were gonna say.  And when they got to me, I said, "I don't know how I can be against something that doesn't exist."  I said simple as that.  I said, "Now if you wanna think affirmative action is doing something," I said, "time and circumstances have changed."  I said, "It's no longer 1964 socially, mentally between blacks and whites."  I said, "But if you think it's working, that's fine.  For my house, it's not working.  I'm interested in affirmative opportunity."  You know and, and she thought they were gonna run me out of the place.  And, and when it was over, I said, "I know you thought you had me there."  I, I said but folks know when you're honest.  See you can be wrong, but as long as you are honest in what you're saying and you believe in what you're saying, you make a mistake, you back up.  I mean the [Chicago] Tribune and New York Times every day has a column, mistakes we made yesterday.  And it's the same thing.
Story_ID: 604765
Speaker 1: Tell me this.  When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I would study more.  I was lackadaisical.  You know sometimes when you may be brighter than your peers, you get lazy.  You don't know the value.  I thought I had to wait till I was older, you know.  Later I look back and I saw everybody who became a major factor was in their twenties.  And I, you know I thought you know I had to be forty years old before I do anything.  I didn't know and had nobody tell me I'm supposed to be successful in my twenties.  Booker [T.]Washington was twenty-six, started Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was twenty-six with the movement, you know.  [W.E.B.] Du Bois was, was in his twenties when he got his Ph.D.  You know I, I start looking back on this.  It's--so if I--I would have paid far more attention to my teachers because you only get a chance to mold a mind once and swallow the stuff.  Because anything you learn, it's gone come back up and help you on a quiz, you know, one way or another, later.  That's what I would do differently.  I wouldn't cheat as I did, you know, writing the answer down on a piece of paper, put it in my pocket or on a pencil in my hand or something.  Because I hurt myself by doing that.  I should have been able to memorize my time tables, you know, all that kind of stuff.  I should have worked harder in preparing my--myself.  Now folks work hard to make sure that the tomatoes grow properly.  You know, you wanna have nice greens.  But you never think about having a nice mind.
Speaker 1: On the other hand you look back at everything you've done to this point.
Speaker 2: I'm pleased.  I, I think from a spiritual point of view.  I don't criticize any of my past 'cause it, it's--it takes effect on how I utilize my future.
Story_ID: 604766
Speaker 1: Now when you--on the other hand when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: That I was Lee Walker straight through.  I'm the Lee Walker that walked across that high school stage and picked up that scholarship in, in May 1957, and my friends have told me.  I had some friends to say, "Lee, blacks who live in neighborhoods like you are trying to keep other blacks out.  You trying to bring blacks in."  I had brothers to say, "Lee, you stay on the South Side [of Chicago, Illinois] so much, why did you move out to Burr Ridge [Illinois]?"  I said, "I don't understand your question, but I think I know where you're going."  I said, "I live in Burr Ridge for two reasons.  The first reason I want to, the second reason I can afford to.  Why do you live where you live, and I hope you love it," you know.  I grew beyond the black thing.  I am pleased that I grew up under segregation.  It gave me an opportunity to compete against blacks.  I could be the lead character in a play.  In a white school, blacks don't get a chance to be the lead character in a play.  You lucky if you, if, if you in the damn play at all.  I didn't have to spend my first eighteen years of education worrying about white folks and racism.  I had black teachers who cared.  Thomas Sowell did a study of eighty-five years of Dunbar [High] School in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  And he did this study analyzing May 17, 1954, the Brown [Brown v. Board of Education, 1954] decision.  There were three high schools in D.C.; one black, two whites.  The blacks scored the same or higher than whites at the two white high schools.  After May 17, 1954, the two white high schools, their scores remained the same and Dunbar went straight to hell.  What do you think happened?
Speaker 1: The smartest black students went to the white high school.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Well they did.
Speaker 2: No, well that true, but that didn't happen here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You mean here?
Speaker 2: I mean with these three schools, with, with that piece of research?
Speaker 1: Well what, well what happened?
Speaker 2: What happened, the best black teachers, the white schools took the best black teachers.  So with the best black teachers, see, see integration put black teachers out of jobs.  Because white folks were not gonna send their kids to black teachers.  I have a Boucle brother, dark skinned, lives in--where is New Trier [High School, Winnetka, Illinois]?  That's at what, that's Evanston where New Trier is?
Speaker 1: No, that's not Evanston, up in--
Speaker 2: North of Evanston, Highland Park, somewhere, you know where it is.  But, but the story was he was in the military and met this white boy.
Speaker 1: Lake Forest.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He met this white guy in, in, in the military.  They came out.  He said man, he has a PhD in mathematics.  I'm trying to get a job.  So the white boy said well hell I'm teaching over here, come on over.  They took him.  He said like he had thirty kids the first day in class.  He said the next day, he said he had twenty-nine, you know.  The next day he say he had twenty-five.  He said you know before the end of the week, he said he only had about ten kids in the class.  He said when it took--when exam time come, the only folks who passed were his kids.  All of a sudden, kids started going back to his class.  I mean that was reality.  You know so, so you know that's the way I, that's the way I look at it.  You know you be sincere, be good at what you do.  I don't know what you guys are doing here.  I notice here--I notice how organized you are with your writing and the questions you ask and he, he knows what the hell he's doing here.  I can't do that.  You know.  But I got enough sense enough to see that you two gotta know what the hell you're doing.
Story_ID: 604767
Speaker 1: You'd be surprised, though.
Speaker 2: Well I've been before others.  Like I said, that's how I made a judgment of, of watching [HM] Jesse [L. Jackson] on his show and watching the white boy put on their shows.  And, and I see 'em reading the damn script.  You know that, that script is in front of you out there and you gotta be a good reader.  I look at what [Peter] Jennings just died.  Hey, white boy didn't finish high school.  He became one of the number one anchors in the world.  Why?  Worked hard at it.  You guys say why didn't he go to college, why didn't he finish high school?  His goal was to be the best anchor.  And if that's your goal, you gotta go somewhere here to pick up all this other stuff that he would have gotten in high school and college.  It didn't come out from osmosis.  I'm sure he read some books.  I'm sure he analyzed others.  You know but he was from London I think, you know but--so that's where I'm coming from.  You know how--when I say high expectation.  I read on, on my desk I have two Bibles.  I have one black Bible you know, and, and then I have this regular King James version out there.  And whites come in and they looking.  I said you ever seen this Bible before?  He said well what's the difference between the black Bible and this Bible?  I said nothing.  I said all the verbiage is the same.  I said this Bible just highlights all the dark skinned folks who were in the Bible.  Didn't say necessarily the black now.  I said but they would be considered black.  Like Allan Boesak when he first came to this country with [Desmond] Tutu.  See Tutu is black here and he's black in South Africa.  Allan Boesak who's your complexion is coloured in South Africa and black when he's here.  And he and I got into an argument in South Africa.  I'm on a trustee of a university there, foundation rather.  And he and I had a talk.  And I discovered, I said man, you know he was, you know just a little bit more than a kid.  I said you haven't been through any hard times.  I said you know a coloured here, you got the whites and the Indians and the coloureds living in the same section.  And, and the blacks don't even live in the town at all 'cause, 'cause South Africa is, is black by day, white by night.  So, so I don't know.  But that's a good question you asked me, you know what I think about.  I, I have thought about that.  And my wife tells me stop looking back and look forward.  I, I used to say if I had listened to [HM] Earl Graves when he said to me, "Lee why are you doing this?"  I was always concerned about the community.  I was community-minded.  Sears called me in once and said, "Lee we didn't hire you in personnel."  'Cause I told a black girl once.  I said that's not your job.  That woman's telling you the wrong thing.  And she went back and said Mr. Walker said.  [HM] Dempsey Travis in this town, didn't know the guy.  I had met him at a, at a meeting.  Sears was moving all these folks out of New York [New York] here.  I come out here, they all white real estate brokers.  I called Dempsey.  I said Dempsey, Sears moving a lot of folks out, black and white.  I said but they have no black real estate brokers involved.  I said why don't you, you know, talk to the company.  I'm sure you know, they wouldn't turn you down.  I get called down to personnel a week later.  Dempsey Travis sent a letter to chairman of the board of Sears, Mr. Lee Walker of the New York office say you are discriminating; you're not hiring, you're not using any black brokers.  I said my God, the folks don't want me in the first place.  They gone--Lee--I said yes I said it, but not you know, with the intent that he's shown here.  Then he had the nerve to call me, wanted to interview me for his damn book about black executives.  I said man, no.  So I can look back and see where I could have been very hurt trying to help folks.
Speaker 1: What (unclear).
Speaker 2: I think and--and I, and I got a number of incidents like that, you know, but I--in economics that invisible hand.  I was always protected because I was doing the right thing.
Story_ID: 604768
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.
Speaker 2: My family was a good family.  Like I said.  Not an educated family.
Speaker 1: Your family now.  I mean you've told--
Speaker 2: My family now.  I got four kids, all grown.  One's in jail right now that I'm hoping he can get out.  Lost a military career, seventeen years, sexual harassment.  So I'm hoping he's out of jail in about, somewhere before October.  I had one brother to die of A.I.D.S. [acquired immune deficiency syndrome].  I have a son-in-law that's dying right now, sickle cell anemia, in the hospital in Montgomery [Alabama].  Worry about that a lot.  He has lived longer than the doctors said he would live.  But three kids, one's out of college, graduated in May.  One is in college right now, and one is in high school.  I worry about that.  The--pray on that.  No call--how's he doing?  I didn't know how--folks talk about A.I.D.S., sickle cell is a terrible disease, terrible.  You know they have to drain their blood out to give you new blood three or four times a years.  That's a disease, tears the body apart.  You know the curls in your blood.  I mean sickle cell, the pain is so deep that the doctors give you narcotics to knock you out because the pain is unbearable.  What will happen to the three kids.  They say one generation, the trait of the disease.  I don't--my daughter didn't know at the time.  I don't think he even knew that he had sickle cell anemia.  Other than that, I have a close knit family.  We go to the rescue you know when that--when there's a need.  I always saw myself as sort of the leader, this Lee thing.  I went to New York [City, New York] and I sent for her sister come stay, look after the kids and I'll put you in school.  She got to the point where she didn't wanna listen.  I said, I sent her back to Troy [Alabama].  I said, "My kids are my problem, you are my mother's problem; go back home, you don't wanna listen to me."  I give tough love because my grandmother [Dora Lumpkin] sort of taught that.  Responsibility, responsibility, responsibility.  She used to say to me spend the first, first six months minding your own business, and the next six months leaving other folks' business alone.  I never forgot that.  She said the left hand doesn't, doesn't have to know what the right's doing.  I didn't know she owned those two houses that we were living in until I was in college.  I didn't know she left a will.  She had the white folks make it up, she couldn't read.  And she knew she was dying.  She put it in her sister's trunk whose husband had died and was living in the house 'cause she knew my mother [Lois Lumpkin] would be there and everybody be looking, looking for money and that kind of stuff.  She had a few dollars left around for them to find.  On the third year where the will had to be probated, my aunt, grand-aunt who could not read, said "Lee Baby, Lee Baby, I found some papers in my trunk; I don't know where they are, but Dora had to have put them there."  I pulled the papers out, I saw it was a will.  She had left my mother nothing, and my mother had taken her for everything.  And I--and that was the last month that I could probate it.  Went down and had it, you know, I was the executor of that, which I still am.
Story_ID: 604769
Speaker 1: Who did she [Dora Lumpkin] leave the money to?  I mean her--
Speaker 2: She, she left money in banks to I think three of the ten, 'course I was one.  And I think my oldest daughter was one.  And, and I think one sister was one.  But I've paid the taxes on the place all along rather than--the past twenty years rather than my, my sisters and brothers.  I have one sister living on the property.  And the others got angry.  I said it's only her because she asked me.  I said, "The land is sitting here."  She said, "Can I put a house on it?"  A trailer, that's a big thing in the South, these trailer homes.  She put a trailer home on it.  'Cause the city came by with an ordinance said you can't have two houses on this lot unless you put a road in between it.  How we gone pay for a road?  So I had to knock the two houses down and (unclear) trailer, a house there.  Three bedroom trailer.  So one sister I don't get along with.  She has a white husband.  Husband has nothing to do with it.  She married to an Italian about thirty years in Great Neck [New York].  She gets drunk and that's when she calls and I can't deal with all that.  So I have--so I can deal with the other sister and brothers tell me how she's doing, all that kind of stuff.  But at the end of the day, you know it's a good family.  We all grew up out of the same structure, you know going to church, get an education.  We all made choices.  My brother said, "I don't want an education.  That college is not for me.  I wanna build my own business."  He, he build--he runs a nightclub.  He was into horses.  I always thought I'd get a telephone call saying he was dead 'cause you know, dealing with drugs and he was even loaning the police, you know, money to go gambling (unclear) with.  You know he, he was that powerful.  But lucky for him, he had to change his life.  He went from, I say from being the devil to being a deacon.  'Cause that's the way that, you know, that's worse than a reformed smoker.  I get tired of him calling me every morning, you know, going over the Bible.  I said (unclear) spare me a little while; give me a break.  But we're close.  So I have--you know the family's in good shape.  I'm blessed that the four kids of mine got an education.  I was the first generation college graduation.  My daughter was the second generation.  And her daughter is the third generation.  Her daughter was Ivy League.  My kids own new homes earlier than I did.  I see the progress there.  Very religious.  So I'm, you know, very pleased.

Speaker 1: Now tell me is there anything we haven't asked you that you think you need to address before I ask my final question?
Speaker 2: That, I would say is enough being a visible black Republican, why you have to be a conservative?  You know.  Because that's--is, is not something that's accepted readily in the black community.  And I've discovered it was just a marketing campaign.  Folks just didn't know that they were conservative.  I had to explain what I was really about.  I say hey, I'm not arguing about Republicans or Democrats, you know.  I'm arguing about Booker T. Washington's philosophical views.  I'm arguing about Frederick Douglass.  I'm arguing about George Washington Carver.  Why do I like the Constitution?  I use, and I use this in talks.  Barbara Jordan during the [Richard] Nixon hearings, Barbara Jordan said, "I thought that George Washington and Alexander Hamilton just forgot about me.  I wasn't part of 'We the People.'  But through amendments and circumstances, I am now part of 'We the People', and I believe in the Constitution.  And I believe in it totally.  And I'm not gonna sit idle by and see folks ruin the Constitution."  And she was talking about we gonna impeach Nixon.  And, and I said Barbara Jordan was not speaking for herself; she was speaking for every black American out there who should believe, truly, in the Declaration of Independence.  I walk at my stuff (unclear) kids.  This is the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.  I do this to show and, and when I looked that, that this had Alexander Hamilton there, then I knew why Barbara Jordan used Alexander Hamilton.  Then I got into Alexander Hamilton a little bit deeper because some folks, they talking about [William Jefferson] Clinton being a black president.  They are far more reason to say that Alexander Hamilton is important (unclear) was black.  He was born in the West Indies.  And to be a, a founding father as he is, he is the only white male whose house in shambles in, in the Caribbeans.  Alexander Hamilton did have curly hair.  So--and if you look at AJ Rogers' book, he is one of the folks that Allen J. Rogers say has some black blood.  But I think there are a lot of whites--I think Ebony once said it's probably a couple of million blacks who are passing for whites.  And Hinsdale [Illinois] of all places, is one of the cities where a number of blacks came to and passed for white.  They said there were two underground railroads; one, one was go through Baltimore [Maryland] as black and come out in [Washington] D.C. as some white person's cousin.  The other railroad was for blacks to go to Canada.  The ones who too dark to pass.  I don't know, but it's--I think it's something to that 'cause I'm reading books about a number of white males who have discovered--who have lived white all their lives.  One was a college president.  And, and then he discovered his mother was black.  Not half black, full black, you know, so I don't pay any attention, but I do carry this.

Speaker 1: I usually carry around Clarence Thomas's picture for show.  When folks talk about him.  I said, "You show me one of his decisions that you disagree with."  I said, "He's not making black decisions.  The Supreme Court does not think about blacks all day."  I say, "He is reading the Constitution."  Go into his office, you know, a huge picture of Booker T. [Washington] and a huge picture of Frederick Douglass.  I use the professors at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I said, "How is Clarence doing?"  And they say, "Well we thought he was affirmative action appointee, but he's not copying off of [Justice Antonin] Scalia.  If anything Scalia is copying off of him.  He is truly interpreting the Constitution the way it should be dissected."  Most folks don't know Clarence was studying to be a priest.  He came out of the seminary.  He was walking behind two Catholic priests cause he fin--he was the first to integrate a Catholic school there in Savannah [Georgia].  On the day [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, he heard one of the priest said "Good, they finally got the son of a bitch."  And that destroyed him.  He, he gave up the priesthood 'cause he believed in those, those two particular priests.  The other thing when Clarence finished high school, and the only black that graduated that year.  The first one.  The white boys wrote in the yearbook, his yearbook that he has in his office, "Clarence flunked the final exam.  He got 98."  And Clarence's grandfather was, like all of us his grandfather did not allow them to come home with B.S.  He said boy don't you go down there and embarrass me in front of them white folks.  I want A's out of you, and that's what they had to come back with.  So that's why I know he's not stupid.  So I had to make a decision when he went to the Supreme Court.  Do I want to defend my friend, or do I wanna act like I don't know him?  And I said wait a minute, you know, how many guys, black male went to Holy Cross [University, Worcester, Massachusetts] and Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut], fine student.  He's not beating his wife, not hitting anybody in the head.  A number of blacks don't like the decisions he made.  I said you know, there are a number of Jews don't like the decisions [Justice Ruther Bader] Ginsburg is making.  But they're not out there saying she's not a Jew.  You know they talk about his white wife.  And my response was Thurgood Marshall wasn't married to a black woman.  Clarence has no black interns there, you know, clerks.  I said do you know how many years Thurgood Marshall was in the Supreme Court before he had a black clerk?  There's a process there.  Clerks gotta come out of circuit court.  And most of them are coming out of Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], Columbia [University, New York, New York].  So I mean they aren't coming from the University of Illinois [Champaign-Urbana, Champaign, Illinois], the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama].  You know so and once he explained to folks, hey, I'll help you get some blacks in the pipeline.  And at that time when he spoke to the National Black Bar, the president said, he said "I'll work with you to get some blacks in."  And the black president of the bar said, "I can't do it.  We gotta picket you."  I said Clarence, I wouldn't, I said I'm not gonna write that.  And I spoke to the president.  I said, "Why didn't you work with Clarence?  He gonna help you."  He said, "He just wanna keep us from picketing him."(Laughter).
