 Larson  Today is January 14, 2010. My name is Mary Larson. We   re here today  at the Vet Med Library with Dr. Lester Johnson and we   ve also got Dr.  Panciera and Dr. Ewing sitting in with us, as well. Dr. Johnson, we   re  in a unique position in your case in that Jerry Gill had already  conducted an interview with you about your earlier years and your  career, so we   ll move onto the main topic here, which is the 1957  anthrax outbreak. Before we get into that, we were talking briefly before  we started about some of the other anthrax outbreaks. Did you want to  discuss what you remember of those a little bit more?  Mainly I just remember having them. When you have an anthrax  outbreak it brings some attention and I think that was emphasized,  certainly to me, in school and I guess all do because it   s a portable  disease and the potential there is pretty great if it really gets going. Right  after I graduated, there was one in the Carter County area and I  mentioned one in the Duncan area. In fact, later on I think there was  another either in Carter or Jefferson County. Fortunately, they weren   t of  the scope in 1957 in Northeastern Oklahoma. Also I can recall one from  the Kingfisher area and, in fact, it seems like there was one more I  thought of since then. I can   t recall.  Now those would have all been before the 1957 outbreak?  Well the one in Ardmore, that first one I mentioned in Ardmore or I  guess I should say Carter County, was somewhere in the early    50s.  Okay and was that when you were     Practicing in Ada.  And you were in Ada for four years. Now you came to OSU to the Vet  Med school   well it was Oklahoma A M at the time.  5  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  In 1954.  It was the sixth year that the school had been  in operation . With the  1957 outbreak, could you talk a little bit about how you were involved in  everything that went on with that?  Well, I first could say that when you have an outbreak of anthrax, it   s  one of the things that gets the attention of the state and federal     everyone, really, involved in animal and human health, too. I did not  participate directly in the action in Northeastern Oklahoma, I   m the one  that stayed home and took care of the large animal clinic while many of  the other people went up there to work, but as I recall they had the  federal and state veterinarians from Oklahoma and the surrounding  states, as well as anyone else, I guess, involved in animal health or  public health that could help. I don   t remember exactly how long they  were up there, but if I had to make a guess I   d say ten days, two weeks,  something like that in the main handling of it.  When the break was made, of course they quarantined around the  premises where it happened as well as the surrounding area. Then when  they went into action, usually the federal government, along with the  help and support of the state veterinarian, takes over. As I said, probably  anyone involved in animal health and public health was subject to get in  there and work in it if they could and that   s why they called on faculty  down here that could be spared. We had several that went up there and  spent some time, probably ten days, two weeks or maybe even longer,  working with them checking animals, supervising, seeing that things  were done according to regulations and fortunately, even though it was  potentially a large break, it still was contained rather rapidly and handled  well. It showed how the government could go into action and do  something when necessary.  Now, you mentioned the quarantines earlier. What would have been  quarantined?  If I remember, at that time the premises of the ranch where this case  occurred had been quarantined and it seems to me there was a parameter  of square miles around that ranch and they were all quarantined. That  was in enforced by, of course, the legal authorities, highway patrol,  sheriff, whoever enforced the laws.  Now would there have been anything besides livestock that you  remember being quarantined for this outbreak?  I would assume, and I don   t know this, I would assume anything was  included that might be affected.  6  Larson  Johnson  Panciera  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Okay, we talked a little about some of the earlier outbreaks. Was the  phenomenon of a larger scale outbreak, like the one in Northeastern  Oklahoma, was that relatively recent in the    50s?  It occurs sporadically about any time with the right set of circumstances,  and I remember talking to some of the people, just trying to  determine   why or how did this happen. And, of course, you have to have the right  temperature, you have the spores that are inactive and then you have to  have the right temperature and humidity and everything to get this to  become then pathogenic and cause the problem and someone   and I  can   t be specific on this   some theorized that because of the earth  movement up there, dams, ponds and things that they were making, that  perhaps then covered spores that were present and had been for a long  time   I know they can live for a long time   and that they then went  through the stages of becoming virulent. Did you ever hear that?  There are reports, I don   t think up there, but reports of other places  where ground was disturbed, followed by     The fact that they were plowing, moving earth and so forth was a factor  and I can   t remember the source of that information, but that was the  idea that I had from that. And of course, that was in the probably early  days of the Grand River and all of the farm ponds that they were making  and they attributed to that.  Okay, now let   s talk about your work specifically. You had mentioned  that a number of people had left to go up and deal with the outbreak. Do  you remember who exactly had left for the field at that point?  Two that I   m pretty sure of were Dr. Ralph Buckner and Dr. Ned Ellett.  Dr. Buckner was in small animals. He was a new person, a recent  graduate from Kansas State and we talked about this a number of times.  He just, more or less, gets here and gets his feet on the ground and they  ship him up there in the large animal work. (Laughs) And of course, Ned  Ellett was in large animals, but Ralph and I talked about that a lot.  That   s where I got a lot of my information on the small stuff that goes on  with something like that.  So, who would have normally been on the campus during the summer? I  mean, how many people would have left in an average summer anyway?  In summers then, we would try to work our vacations in during those  summer months and then once we were on a two semester system then,  as far as veterinary school was concerned, and once the faculty was  relatively small for what we were doing and we were busy for those  approximately nine months. We did keep the clinic open because we  7  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  were trying to get a clientele established and new school and let them  know that we were here, so both the small animal clinic and the large  animal clinic was in that situation.  So your responsibility during this time would have been the large animal  clinic.  Large animal. And back at that time, I would say that many cattle,  swine, sheep, a few goats, fewer horses, this was a low point as far as the  horse thing here in Oklahoma was concerned. It did pick up later on.  How busy were you? What sort of impact did everyone taking off for the  field have on the general work flow here?  We were busy. We weren   t overworked, but I guess having to be  available more hours in the day, it did make for long days sometimes.  How often? Because I   m assuming in a lot of cases that you were  making house calls essentially.  No, I stayed here at the clinic. And that   s another thing I am not sure of  is who ran the ambulatory. Dr. Moe was the ambulatory clinician, but if  I remember, he usually took his reserve time with the Army along about  July and August and I don   t... Surely, as involved as he was with  regulatory medicine, if he happened to be around here he was involved.  But I do remember he always tried to set his reserve. He   d go on a  month   s reserve with the Army in July or August. And that   s why I   m  confused a little bit with Walter Rice, because Walter wanted to go to  Canada, but we were busy.  How many large animals would be coming in the course of the week?  If you   d like to think of case load, it would have been light. Thinking of  practice, it would have been light. On the other hand, because of the  circumstances with fewer people, enough to keep us busy.  Did you have other responsibilities besides the clinic or was that enough  to keep  you busy ?  At that time, since we weren   t having classes, the clinic was the only     that and to get ready for the fall and the spring semesters for lectures.  Do you remember who would have been doing some of the lab work  back here after Dr. Panciera was gone in the summer?  Well, Dr. Glenn was here. Dr. Malle. I guess Dr. Malle you   d have to  8  Ewing  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  say, generally speaking, handled poultry, but he did other things.  Dr. Paul Barto.  Paul Barto and there are others, but I just can   t think of the names.  Was there a need to bring anyone from the outside to help out with  anything over the course of the summer as far as the operation?  No, like helping do the work? No, except students. We would try to hire  two or three senior students in small animal and two or three in large  animal and some of the maybe freshman or first and second year fill in,  too. When I came, Jim Taylor and Bob Ream were the two senior  students who worked my first summer with me, and Jess Walker. Jess  was a year or two behind them. We had some pretty good times. They  were young and eager. (Laughter)  Still had lots of energy.  Yeah.  So during the course of the summer, what would your students who were  that summer have gotten involved in, more cases?  Yes, and more individual attention and they usually liked it because you  didn   t have to be in there with six or eight or ten others or a whole class  trying to see something or do something and I needed the physical help  and, of course, they needed to get the practice in suturing or whatever  and treatment and injections and such as that, so it worked out pretty  well. There are times when I really think back on how I enjoyed that  break.  And the students enjoyed it, too?  Oh yes.  And I   m thinking specifically for 1957 they probably would have been a  little more involved that summer than normally because there were  fewer people.  Fewer people. In some respects, because we were taking vacations and  some being away all the time, it did not have quite the effect had the  break not happened, we   d have a few more people here. We always felt  we were short handed anyway. (Laughter)  So there wasn   t any summer teaching going on at that point except to  9  Johnson  Panciera  Johnson  Ewing  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  work with the students     There were a few classes, but as far as the clinics were concerned, I   m  not aware, are you Roger? Any for other classes? Maybe the basic  sciences may have offered probably graduate courses, but otherwise     I don   t think there were any classes going on in the professional  curriculum during summer.  No formal curriculum, I didn   t think so either.  The graduate program hadn   t really gotten off the ground.  No. I get a little mixed up here because the three semester program  during the war that Texas A M was on, they were trying to push them  through. But we weren   t into that.  At the clinic what would you have been handling over the summer?  Of course, around then there were quite a few dairies around here, much  more than I guess in recent years and, of course, beef cattle and enough  swine and sheep to give us some variety. There were some pretty good  flocks of registered sheep in the area. If you remember Mr. Edwards  down below had some real good Southdowns, I believe, and there were a  good Hampshire flock, a good registered flock. And they were good  clients.  Because of the outbreak, was there concern around the area about the  outbreak spreading to this neck of the woods?  Well, of course, that   s the main thing that causes them to get to work as  soon as they can. They   re ready to mobilize and go and that   s the idea is  to contain it so it doesn   t spread. So anytime there is a break like that,  you have to be concerned that somehow it doesn   t break out and spread.  That   s what they   re trying to do. Of course, the best example there is  foot and mouth. We haven   t had foot and mouth disease in years and  years that I   m aware of.  One of the things I was wondering was if you spent a lot of time at the  large animal clinic either doing vaccinations that you might not have  done otherwise or talking to community members, trying to reassure  them about the quarantine perimeter or passing on information.  I don   t recall anything out of the ordinary except, of course ,they   re  going to ask about it, but I thought the media did a good job in  informing people of what was going on. Now one thing too I just  10  Panciera  Johnson  Ewing  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Panciera  Johnson  Panciera  Johnson  Panciera  Larson  Johnson  happened to think of, and Dr. Buckner and Dr. Ellett mentioned this, that  they tended to burn the animal on the spot, the carcass, because they  didn   t want to haul it and take a chance on spread, and he could look up  and see the plumes of smoke in that area. Did you ever go up there?  No. I was here for the initial diagnoses and then I went on vacation. It  seems to me they used a lot of old tires to     Used tires, yes. And that makes that black smoke. And I can remember  them telling about just look anywhere around you and larges puffs of  smoke   black smoke going up.  Dr. Denny in Cushing said that as a small boy and, of course, his dad  was involved as a local practitioner, but he as a small boy remembered  those plumes of smoke.  Yeah. To me that was second hand; I didn   t see them, just they would  tell me.  Well just from other experience that you might have had with the  anthrax outbreak, what were some of the methods that     That   s the closest, I guess, I was   just second hand. I never personally  experienced it and the ones that I mentioned earlier, I   ve just   except  one, except the Kingfisher one where Dr. Corcoran and I were involved  in that and they hauled that animal from the Kingfisher area over here on  a flat bed trailer. That   s a pretty good trail from Kingfisher. Do you  remember that one?  I remember one when I was in Denver at an AVMA meeting and the one  I   m thinking about was from Weatherford.  Weatherford?  Dale Scomp called me in Denver; got me out of bed. They hauled some  animals up here on a truck.  What I remember about the one in which Dr. Corcoran and I were  involved with was we scrubbed that quadrangle.  We were multi-taskers in those days.  If you had something that was brought in, what would you have done to  try and disinfect or contain?  And I   m sure you did the same thing in the postmortem or your labs and  11  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  so forth. And of course, of what I can remember is that bed trailer, here   s  this animal and here   s this trail of blood.  They probably should have scrubbed it all the way from Kingfisher to  here.  All the way  (Laughter) They had to leave some for seed, I guess.  So what were you using for cleaning when you were scrubbing these?  Lye, I believe.  What year would that have been, do you remember?  No, I don   t. That was sometime after the northeast break.  Do you think there was more demand for services from the public that  summer through the clinic than other summers?  No, I don   t think so. We were trying to get the school started, get it on  its feet, and we were trying to build a clientele, so there were times  where we were much busier as far as that goes.  I seemed to recall reading in some of the newspaper articles that there  were a couple of other diseases that were roaming around like Lepto  that summer.  Oh yeah, Lepto was     And I just wondered if those were noticeable enough as far as what you  might have seen.  I guess not that made an impression on me.  Were there still people out in the field from the university when the  school year started?  I don   t think so. Not that I recall. Fortunately, I think they pretty well got  the essential work done. Of course they were still working and the  regulatory people looking after that, but the pressure was off, so I don   t  recall anyone was late getting back to school.  So there weren   t any changes in teaching or clinic duties or anything  like that. You mentioned a little bit of what went on from a regulatory  standpoint, do you know what the process was from the beginning of the  identification? What you recall what would have gone on?  12  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Panciera  Johnson  What usually happens   and this is what I can remember from what I  was taught and of course as a clinician, if you suspected a reportable  disease, like anthrax, you reported to authorities immediately, preferably  the federal people or the state people or both. And then fortunately, they  would carry on from there which was good. And, of course, if it turned  out to be a negative, well that   s fine. If it turned out to be positive then  they globalized all of their man power and woman power and did it.  What distinguished this outbreak from some of the earlier ones, do you  think?  The potential size of it, I think. And, of course, when these happen it  kind of depends on the circumstances and how long it   s been since  another one and what it was like, because, I guess, the potential of  anthrax, you just have to really pay attention and fortunately, that   s the  largest that I can recall and the others that I have been even secondarily  associated with were handled rather promptly and, I guess, successfully.  But some of the others started either more slowly or smaller.  Well even one animal, that   s enough. That   s enough to get their attention  and I know that, in my mind, and this is back from my training, that if I  suspected it, get it checked and report it immediately. Of course, you   re  going to have those that are false reports. Of course, if you   re not sure,  don   t take a chance though and usually that gets state and federal  attention right off.  Did you get a sense from the reports you were hearing or what you  might have been hearing from your colleagues that this was a more  virulent version than normal? Or was it just because of the conditions?  I think more of the conditions. You could speak on that more.  We   ve already touched on that a little bit, but if you wanted to     I don   t know how many gradations of virulence there is for anthrax  organisms. I know the LD 50 for a mouse is one bug. A lot of the  epidemiology wasn   t really known back then. Nowadays the issue of  farm ponds, rain and then no rain or the pond going down, that sequence  and then the growth of vegetative forms as the pond went down, that  wasn   t known then.  Well, of course, it   s been known, certainly, to be a potential, has been  for centuries, a potential problem. And this is all farther back and I was  in the service discussing germ warfare and anthrax always came up as  one of those potentials. There was a general feeling that this would be  13  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  one of the things used if they decided to use germ warfare. And, of  course, they want something that acts fast and is virulent and is deadly  and it is.  Do you remember some of the other possibilities that were mentioned  along with anthrax?  Foot and mouth, but that was more of a fast spreading disease, and it  really would be a great hazard to the livestock industry. You mentioned  something awhile ago. Plague was another one that they considered as a  potential germ warfare agent.  Now you mentioned how it would be a hazard to the livestock industry.  Do you have any sense of what the economic impact would have been  with the 1957 outbreak?  No. It   s the fear spread and let   s get this thing stopped.  At least from the standpoint of preparedness or diagnostics or pathology  or any of those issues, do you think there were any particular lessons  learned by the veterinary community from the    57 outbreak?  Yes, I wouldn   t say anything new. They knew, I think it showed  internally in my mind that the set up could and would and did work that  they had and it went into action and we did this, we did this, and we did  this as we planned. I thought they did an excellent job and though  sometimes you think of the regulatory stuff and that   s just something to  get in the way, but when you need it, you need it. I thought that was a  good example.  So the moral of the story was that it seemed to have worked as it was  planned to work.  Right.  Do you remember any stories from any of your colleagues when they  came back? You mentioned the discussion about the plumes of smoke  and so on, but do you remember anybody telling any other war stories?  (Laughs)  No, I don   t. I talked to Dr. Buckner more because I think that impressed  him more because he was a small animal clinician and to be sent up  there, it didn   t seem to bother Dr. Ellett. (Laughs)  Is there anything about that time period and that outbreak that we  haven   t talked about that you wanted to address, or anything about how  14  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  things were working here at the Vet Med school during that time?  Oh, not particularly other than we were trying to get established and get  a reputation for the school to produce a graduate and get them to the job.  That was our goal and even though we thought we were overworked     well, we were in ways. But, on the other hand, we were busy and it kept  us out of trouble. (Laughs) One thing that I liked, I guess, about coming  here was that, of course, in practice there was one other person. Solo  practice, for me, would really be rough. When you get to a multiple  practice it takes a lot of pressure off.  How many people were on the large animal faculty at that point that you  recall?  Let   s see, of course, they   re constantly changing. And let   s separate that  from ambulatory for the present because at that particular time there was  myself and Ned Elliot, and sometimes we would have a third person  with Dr. Wolfe as the department head, that was his area when you  could get him in or he wanted to come in and work. So you could say  two, three, three and a half maybe with his administrative duties. Of  course, he did less and less. That   s about that time. Later than that, we  began to hire younger people; we probably should have thought of them  as interns, but they were younger people and they got experience. They  wanted a year or two of experience before they went into practice and so  we got help that way and, of course, as soon we could we got them on  the night work. (Laughter)  That   s always a wise decision.  Also included in large animals, Dr. Moel was in charge of large animals  and he usually had an assistant. And of course, Pat Meyer, Paul Cardiac  started here and Dave Schoneweiss. He usually had an assistant. See Dr.  Moel had been here a long time and he had been taking care of the  college herds for I don   t know how many years and he stayed with them.  I guess that   s the main thing he did besides his teaching load.  Now you had talked about how you were keeping the clinic going over  the summer because you were trying to build that as a part of the Vet  Med school. How big a part do you think that that public outreach  played?  I thought it was very important. You can   t very well set up a clinic and  say I   m going to be open this month but be closed the next three months.  If they get into the habit of coming to see you and think of you as their  veterinarian then they expect you to be able to take care of them. So  from a standpoint of building a clientele, I thought that was very  15  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  important. Now, of course Dr. Wolfe had been in practice and he was  department head and that was kind of his philosophy. Now back then,  we didn   t have much in the way of extension in Veterinarian Medicine  and he took it on himself, so to speak, to see that we got out over the  state. In a way, it was a way of promoting the school and just putting the  information out that we were here and available and what we had.  Now for people who had come as faculty to the university from private  practices, you had done this, although you were at a bit of a distance,  were there people who brought their practices with them essentially?  You mean practice here and private?  Right, if they had been private practice previously and they then joined  the faculty here at Stillwater. Were there people from the area that did  who would have brought their clientele with them, essentially, to the  clinic?  The only exception to what I   m going to say would be Dr. Knotts  because he was the local man and he was hired on   and that was the  requirement at the time of the AVMA, if I recall this properly. The local  veterinarian would be offered an adjunct or faculty position or help if he  moved into their area because it was going to cut into his practice. Other  than that, and one of the first things I was told, and I know this went on  and on and on, you will not carry on a private practice. It   s forbidden.  Just don   t do it. I agreed not to and I didn   t.  I was thinking for people who had started out in private practice and  came here, were there people that may have followed and come here?  To some extent, inevitably, but not really to amount to anything. But I  know, I had people I knew in Ada and Ardmore area that would come up  occasionally, if necessary. But that   s too far. They should take care of  their local man. But I was told right off you don   t carry on a private  practice.  How was that outreach expanded over the years with the clinic?  For our area, I think it   s done pretty well over the years because we, of  course, Arkansas did not have a school so we drew on that area. Roughly  speaking, halfway to Manhattan,  Kansas , halfway to Colorado,  halfway to College Station. So we had quite a large area to draw on and  there were people that would bypass us and go to Manhattan and vice  versa because they knew the people there for various reasons. But I  thought we had a pretty good area to draw from and be a source.  16  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Ewing  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Were there particular specialties that the Vet Med school was known for  in the early days?  Well of course, I guess because of the animal industry here, beef cattle  was the most numerous and certainly the work that had been done by the  ag people over on campus, we already had that particular reputation.  When I first came here, there weren   t many horses right after World War  II and the horse population, or the use of them as a beast of burden was  not very prominent and that had to be built up. I think I mentioned this  with Dr. Gill, for some reason, the Shetland pony was the most popular  animal. We had Shetland ponies here worth fifty or sixty thousand  dollars, according to the owner.  That   s a pricy pony.  (Laughs) What can they do?  You don   t often see Shetland pony racing.  No.  Well is there anything else that you want to talk about that we haven   t  addressed so far?  I don   t think so, unless some of you have some comments?  Well one question I might raise is do you happen to remember anything  about Dr. Briscoe and Dr. Arnold, who had just graduated in 1957, and  both got involved?  Yeah, both were involved in that. I visited more with Harvey Arnold for  some reason and Burt. Burt would come by quite frequently and we   d  visit, but I guess just because of personality or whatever it was, Harvey  and I, we did more visiting. But as far as anything specific on that, no, I  don   t remember anything. I think Harvey spent all his time down in  southeast Oklahoma and Burt over in the Edmond area, didn   t he?  They certainly had a trial by fire right upon graduation. Well I want to  thank you for your time and we really appreciate all of your help on this.  Well, I hope it helps. But being on the sidelines, my question is if I  know enough of the details to make it worthwhile.  But what we wanted to find out was what was going on on the home  front. Someone had to keep the home fires burning.  17  Johnson  Panciera  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  Larson  Johnson  We were keeping it going and we managed to do it. And on other  occasions, I remember Eric Williams went up and ran small animals for  a period of time, I can   t remember what the circumstances were there.  They were out and here   s both iron men, so to speak.  Operating on one or two shoe strings. It was touch and go.  Yeah, yeah. And Wiley didn   t mind going up to small animals, Wiley  Wolfe. So we had to fill in wherever we had to.  It sounds like a very congenial atmosphere and it sounds like everybody  pulled together while you were getting things going. Well thank you very  much for all of your help. We do appreciate it.  Well good to talk to you and visit with you and I hope it helps.  And thank you gentlemen for sitting in.  I   m glad they came in to boost me and to back me up or to correct me if  necessary.  -------  -------
