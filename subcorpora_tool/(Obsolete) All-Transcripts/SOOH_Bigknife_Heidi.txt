 Little Thunder  Bigknife  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Sunday, December 2,  2012. I   m interviewing jeweler Heidi Bigknife for the Oklahoma Native  Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Heidi   s home. Heidi,  you work in silver and gold and with semi-precious stones. Your jewelry  has always combined a Native sensibility with contemporary forms, but  it always has this kind of beautiful simplicity. Thank you for taking the  time to talk with me.  You   re welcome.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Enid, and I grew up in Denver.  What did your folks do for a living?  My mom, when I was born, she was a housewife, and my dad was  training pilots at the Air Force base in Enid. He went on to be a  commercial pilot, and my mom went on to work in the design field,  interior design.  Brothers or sisters?  I have one sister. She   s two years younger than me.  What was your relationship with your grandparents on either side of  your family?  I wasn   t horribly close with my dad   s parents. I think I had some kind of  special relationship with his mom because I have some pictures of us  5  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  when I was really little. She did a lot for me. His dad, I don   t think I  really had a closeness with his dad, my paternal grandfather. My mom   s  parents, I have memories of her dad, but we weren   t close. I did have  some time   probably the grandparent I had the most time with was my  mom   s mom.  Is that on your Shawnee side?  Yes, that   s my Shawnee side. I actually   I   m trying to think how long.  I lived with her when I was in graduate school during the summer. I  think it was my first summer. I lived with her for maybe a month. She  was a really, really hard person to get to know, but she   s probably the  one, she   s definitely the one I had most contact with.  How important was your Shawnee heritage growing up?  Actually, when I was small I always knew I was Indian, but that   s as far  as it went. That   s all I knew, but my mom always, you know, she always  told us. It was always important to her. I knew, but it didn   t really start  to mean that much to me until, it was probably until I got to college. I  wonder if it   s when I took   I took a class there. Was it all American  Indian history? Which seems surprising that it was at my school, but it  seems like that   s what it was.  I think that awakened something in me. Then right after I got my  bachelor   s, (it seems like I did just have a summer) I started at the  Institute of American Indian Arts. I guess my identity really started to  play a part in who I wanted to be and who I was and who I wanted to  become.  So your mom was doing a little bit of work in design. Can you talk about  maybe how she or other   I don   t know if there were other extended  family members that were artistic?  My mom is very artistic. She   s always drawn. I actually have several  things in the house here that she   s done. She has a very, she just has a  really good eye. She can see color really well. She has a sense of  balance, a real deep sense of balance. You know, that   s so helpful in  interior design because she can put a room together and say,    It   s off.  You need something else here,    or    The color is off.     My sister, I think, was showing artistic talent but did not pursue it.  Really, I mean, I feel like one of the closest things was, and it wasn   t  necessarily art, but I had one of my grandmother   s sisters, a maternal  great-aunt, worked for a watchmaker, I believe, in Wichita. That was the  closest thing we can come to that has anything to do with jewelry, sort  6  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  of, is that. I was encouraged, I guess, as a kid. My mom was constantly  doing little craft projects with us and stuff.  Like, for example?  Oh, one of the fun things I remember doing was we would get these  Styrofoam, (you can still get them; it   s stuff, probably, some kids still  do) getting Styrofoam balls and egg shapes and stuff, and then you   d  have pretty pins and like a sequin that you would put a pin through. It  seems like we had Ric Rac and ribbons. It seems like we had clothes  pins that we would make clothes for. (Laughter) I   m kind of  remembering that. I can   t remember   it must   ve been that we cut the  fabric and then glued it around it or something, and it was those old  clothes pins that had the rounded head. But really, from my mom, and I  know mostly from her side of the family, I learned how to make  something out of nothing. I   m still like that, and I think that   s really a  creative way of thinking.  What is your first memory of seeing Native art?  Oh, wow. I guess probably   I   m trying to think if my mom had some  hanging up when we were growing up. My grandmother   s house was  just a treasure. I   m sure I saw some there. It would   ve been of the really  stereotypical variety mixed in with Catholicism, so images from that and  then family photos. It was just a really neat, kind of a kitschy mix. I  think, it would either be my grandmother or my mom, something in our  household when I was young.  What is your first memory of making art, doing art?  I know I did things earlier than this, but for some reason I remember  being in a grade school class, and we were making   it must   ve been our  class, and we were making boxes for Valentine   s. Was that something  we did every year, and then people, you know, classmates would put  Valentines in your box or something?  It seems like mine was a cube, and I was covering it with these shapes  that were suggestive of flowers made out of tissue paper. I don   t know.  You asked me that, and it   s funny because I was just thinking of that  memory today. I know I   ve thought of it before, and I wonder if that   s  the first time I thought that I wanted to be an artist. It might   ve been. I  don   t know.  So you did know fairly early on that you wanted to be an artist?  I think I might   ve known early on. Then because of life happening and  7  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  circumstances, I think I completely forgot, and I had no idea that I  wanted to be an artist anymore.  How about art experiences? What kinds of art experiences did you have  in elementary school?  The closest thing I can think of would be   I was lucky enough to be in  public grade school at a time when there must   ve been more money  because we had a gifted and talented program. I know I got to do things  with that program that I wouldn   t otherwise have gotten to do, and not  everyone who I was in school with got to do those things, either. It was,  like, selective kids. It seems like we went on some tours of historic  buildings or important architecture in Denver. There   s a very good art  museum in Denver. There   s a very good natural history museum, and  I   m sure I went to those when I was young.  How about, like, junior high?  Gosh. Was I only thinking of boys in junior high? (Laughter) What was  I doing in junior high?  Or high school, just what you can remember about your art experiences.  I   m trying to think what classes I might   ve been taking, too. I remember  becoming interested in writing in junior high, I guess the creative,  artistic side of it because we read To Kill a Mockingbird. I think it was  in my eighth grade class. I remember that was the first time I realized an  author could imply something, but it was up to the reader to fill in the  story. That was like a door opening for me.  I also took shop class and  drafting in junior high. I was the only female in those classes.   In high school   oh, duh  In high school I took photography, and that  really got me going. That really was important. I took a photography  class. It was black and white. We had a dark room. That was what I did  in college was photography.  How was it? Can you elaborate a little more about how it was so  important?  I mean, in retrospect I think it ended up being really important because it  was a way for me to express myself, and I hadn   t been able to do that  any other way. Of course, I had to fulfill my assignments, and I was a  beginning photographer. I still have a lot of those images, but they   re  nothing to write home about. (Laughs) Then my senior year I had been  picked to be part of, it was called People to People Student Ambassador  Program, and so I went to Europe. We were gone for, I think it was six  8  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  weeks and three home stays, and I met all these people from other high  schools. Not everyone had graduated yet, and I had. When I came back I  had just oodles of film, and my high school professor let me come back  and print some of it there. Then I had a family member who had a dark  room that I used.  You know, I cannot remember how it came about, but I had the idea to  do some self-portraits. I made up my face, and it was all these black and  white   I think I still have the pictures. I   d have to pull them out to  remember exactly, but it was almost like I had a mask on in a way. I  remember being really impacted by the group KISS. I was in grade  school. I remember dressing up as Lady KISS and had black lips. Some  of that was in my head, but those were, I think, my first self-portraits,  and they   re very intense. I think that was when I wanted to be a  photographer. When I was taking pictures in college, I think I started out  taking pictures of other people, but they were all portraits, and then I  turned the camera on myself. I just was trying to figure out who I was.  What was your folks    reaction to some of your photography in high  school? Were they supportive of     They were supportive at that point. It was my mom. I didn   t see my dad  very often. I   m trying to think if he thought some of them were weird.  He was impressed. They were both impressed with the pictures I came  back with from Europe, and I gave those as gifts. I   m trying to think if I  only shot black and white. They were supportive. I think I decided I  wanted to try to work for National Geographic, and I sent them a  portfolio. (Laughter) My mom, she tells the story. I don   t remember all  of it, but she said she was really supportive of me.  You went to college in Wisconsin. Is that right?  Yes.  How did you end up there?  Really, it was only because I really wanted to get out of town. I had been  accepted to another school which was only an hour away.  In Colorado?  Yes, but it was a deferred enrollment, so I would have to wait until the  spring. There was something in me that was like,    I   ve got to get out.    I  had a friend who had gotten into or had applied to Beloit College in  Wisconsin. I don   t know if I   d talked to him, but there was a connection  there, and then I got in.  9  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  As an art major?  Yes.  Can you talk a little bit about the kind of background that you got in art  in college?  Sadly, it wasn   t very good. (Laughter) It   s not known as an art school. I  mean, it does have its own small art museum, and I think by now the  programs might be a little more solid, but it was not a great prep school  to go on and do more art, I   ll say that. I don   t think I came out of there     I had very little command of drawing.  And you hadn   t done any three-dimensional work?  I had done   I enjoyed my ceramics class. I did that. I made a lot of cool  mugs. (Laughter) I must   ve had a 3D design class because I remember  casting plaster in a milk carton and then carving it. It was pretty lame,  actually. (Laughter) Mostly I did photography, and the photography  professor, he probably had the broadest reputation in terms of people  knowing his work. I don   t know. It was what it was. I didn   t come out  very well prepared, I   ll say that.  What did you end up doing after you got your BA? Was it a BA?  Yes, I got my BA in Studio Art. I went straight into Institute of  American Indian Arts.  How did you find out about that?  I had a cousin, a first cousin, who was there. My mom, I think, was even  more excited about it than I was because I think that if she could   ve  done it when she was young, it was like her dream. That   s how I knew  about it was my cousin, and I went straight from my BA into IAIA.  What was that like?  It was interesting. One of the greatest things about it was I had my  bachelor   s already, so I could take anything I wanted. I took  photography. I kept doing photography.  Who was teaching photography?  Meridel Rubenstein. I did some really great work while I was there. It  felt big and important, and I can   t believe how prolific I was. (Laughs) If  10  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  I could do that now, I mean   I don   t know. I look back and think,    It   s  so hard to know how good you   ve got it,    because I didn   t have all the  pressures of being completely an adult yet, and so I was able to just  work a lot. Then, of course, that   s where I took my first jewelry class.  With who?  It was Lane Coulter, and he was just awesome. Nobody in our beginning  class knew he was anything at all, and it turned out he was super, super  well-known and super famous, (Laughter) super great, but because of  the type of person that he is, he was there teaching the class and so laid  back. It was just great, and I took to it immediately.  What kinds of things did you learn from him?  Soldering. I think I still have all the first pieces I made. I   m trying to  think if I had one or two classes from him. Then I had one class   was it  Preston Duwyenie? He   s a potter now, but it seems like   no that must  not be right. I don   t know. Anyway, soldering. I know that we made a  hinge in one of his classes. It was all the basics, stone setting, beginning  stone setting. There was inlay. Several classes were inlay, raising, just  basically everything, all the basics.  Did you have the feeling at that moment maybe,    I like this as much as  photography,    or did you know the significance of your jewelry class  yet?  I didn   t know yet, but I must   ve really liked it because I know I came  back for another class. At that time, with my access to all the studios, I  did a huge project that was a mix of photography and metals, which was  so great. I mean, that   s what schools are so great for. You have all that  access, and I don   t think I realized yet. It   s interesting because when I  look back at the work I was doing, even in those beginning classes, it   s  like if I would   ve been the instructor I would   ve thought,    She   s got  something in here. It would be something to encourage this because  something   s happening.    Whether I was completely aware of it or not, I  don   t know.  That must   ve been a real inter-tribal education, too, for you, a cultural  experience.  It was. I mean, it   s also embarrassing to say it, but it was the time   I had  never been around so many Indian people and known that the people  were Indian and had access to inter-tribal ceremony, inter-tribal thought  ways and culture ways. It really was a huge awakening about something  that I didn   t know was so important to me. Yes, it was really a big deal.  11  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  So, after you left the Institute, what happened next?  I   m trying to think of how long it was after I left... It seems like I just got   the Helen Hardin Scholarship  through the mail. I went back to my  mom   s house in Denver, and she let me set up a jewelry studio in her  basement. I had received   I can   t tell you the exact date. I   m pretty sure  it was after I graduated. I had received the Helen Hardin Memorial  Scholarship, and it was a complete, complete surprise. To this day I do  not know who nominated me for it. I took the money, and I bought  jewelry supplies. I still have quite a few of them today. It   s what I   m  working from or with.  My mom let me set up a studio in her basement. I had worked at the  Institute the whole time I was there, and one of the jobs I   d had was in  the new museum shop downtown when the museum opened downtown.  Through a contact there, I got a job at a gallery called Eagle Plume   s in  Allenspark, Colorado, which was between, seems like it was between,  like, Boulder and Estes Park. It was far away. (Laughter) I commuted  with the owner   s daughter. I had that job for several months that  summer, but I was starting to have several crises of my own and ended  up leaving that job later in the year. I   m trying to think. I don   t think I  stayed the whole summer, but that   s what I did right away. Then I knew,  also, that I had been accepted to graduate school, so I was kind of like  biding my time until I left for that.  So you weren   t trying to do any small shows, necessarily, although you  were making jewelry?  It seems like I was trying to find places to sell. It seems like I might   ve  gone into a store in Cherry Creek in Denver, but I don   t remember trying  to do any shows. Oh, I know. Some of my photography   was it during  that summer? It seems like it was. There was a new photography teacher  that I had actually been fortunate enough to take part in screening him  for being hired because I was the manager of the photo lab.  His name is Larry McNeil, and I think he may still be at the Institute.  I   m not sure. Anyway, he was coming onboard, and I think it was  because of him. He got me into a show that I think was in Canada, so  some of my photographs went up to Canada. Then also, I was covered in  the Museum of New Mexico magazine with some of my photos, and so  that work was out. Then there was a show at the Denver Art Museum. I  can   t remember how I got involved in that, but some of my photographs  were there also. So my photography was being shown, but I don   t think I  was showing any jewelry.  12  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Was that Native  Indian/Inuit  Photographers Association in existence  at that point? Do you remember?  I don   t know, but it seems like it was.  But it was a Native show?  It seems like it was a Native show.  When did you sell your first piece of artwork, and was it a photograph,  or was it jewelry, or do you remember?  I think it was when I was working at the museum shop, so it was  probably    91 or    92. I was working in the museum gift shop. One of the  other guys that worked at the museum commissioned me to make him a  ring. He was Navajo. It seems like he was talking to me about three  sacred mountains. I carved a wax with three mountain forms on it and  then cast it for him. I   m not remembering selling any photographs, but  I   m remembering making him that ring and selling it to him. It would   ve  been    91 or    92.  So you go on to graduate school at the University of Illinois. Is that  right?  Oh, I lied. I remember selling a photograph  (Laughs)  Oh, okay. Let   s talk about that. (Laughter)  When I was in photography classes at the Institute, (I   m trying to think,  did I take a photography class every semester? I think I did) I was doing  these huge projects every time. I did this project where (I still have it) I  made a costume. I don   t know if I would even call it a costume. It was  almost, in a sense, a regalia, sort of, my own interpretation of it because  it was sort of a ribbon shirt idea.  I was taking fashion design, too. It was like a ribbon shirt idea, but I had  made the collar and the fringe here at the seam   it was all suede. I was  completely focused on self portraiture the whole time I was there. I had  painted my face. No, that was a separate project, that outfit. Okay, I take  that back. It was when I made the Santa outfit. (Laughter)  Okay, I made a Santa outfit, and I think I wore it with cowboy boots. I  miss sewing. (Laughs) Anyway, it was also portraits, and I constructed a  tree out of plywood with dowels coming out for all the branches. The  tree was separate. I took all these pictures of myself dressed as Santa,  and I think I wrote it on the wall behind me. It was called The Day  13  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Before Columbus. I mean, I can   t tell you my exact thought process at  this point, but it was like it was serious but it was also humorous.  I had these million pictures, black and white pictures. I then went in the  dark room, and I printed, like, maybe forty of them or something, and I  mounted them on black mat board. They were maybe three inches by  two and a half inches, and I made them all into ornaments and hung  them all on the tree. I think I might   ve made a skirt for it. I don   t  remember. Meridel Rubenstein, the instructor, the professor, was  instrumental in getting the museum to buy that.  Wow.  I think it was when Rick Hill was at the museum. They bought that, and  I think at one point, they didn   t know where it was.  Now, when you say museum, do you mean the Institute Museum or the  Heye  George Gustav Heye Center ?  The Institute Museum.  Okay.  I did sell that, and I don   t remember if it was a lot or a little. I think I  was just really excited that they bought it. So I had sold jewelry and  photography.  So you go on to graduate school, University of Illinois. How did you  happen to choose that place?  Because I was crazy. (Laughs) No, I try to never say that about myself,  but really. I applied to three schools. One of them was   which  university is in Tempe? Is it University of Arizona? I can   t remember  because I think there   s one in Phoenix and one in Tempe. Did I apply to  both? Honestly, I know why I applied there. It was because I knew and  had had several conversations with Charlene Teters, and she had gone  there.  Do you want to explain who she is?  Charlene Teters is a Spokane woman. She   s an artist and an activist. She  has, I think, probably built a lot of her, maybe, professional life and  activist career since going to the university, which for many, many,  many years had a fake Indian chief as its mascot. Anyway, so that was  how I found out about it. She was the one to inform me, there   s a stipend  for American Indian students and so on, and so I went ahead and applied  14  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  there.  I got into all the schools that I applied to. I visited Tempe. It seems like I  was at the Phoenix and the Tempe dark rooms or someplace in Arizona I  applied. It seems like there was another place, and I can   t think of it. The  University of Illinois, I went to visit, and honestly, I didn   t like it from  the minute I was there, even when I visited. I think the reason I went  back was because I had a full ride and a stipend, so that was how I ended  up there.  What kind of art background did you get there?  It was interesting because I applied there for the photography program,  and that was when I was beginning to transition into jewelry. I got there  and, oh, wow, was I ever ill-prepared, truly ill-prepared. I had had the  highest glowing recommendations from people at the Institute, and  Meridel Rubenstein is extremely well-known in her field, a lot of  accolades, great artist. I thought that I really had been doing important  things. I got there, and I don   t know. I think, honestly, part of what  happened was I was brought in as part of a quota, so there was a lot of  resentment. Not only that, I truly was ill-prepared. I did not have the  technical background that most of my peers had, and I ended up actually  taking an undergraduate color photo course to try to play catch-up on  some things. Very ill-prepared.  Not only that, ill-prepared psychologically, especially coming right out  of the Institute. Number one, I was in culture shock. Number two,     Really, there   s 40,000 students here?    And IAIA, what were we, like  300? I was completely overwhelmed. Then my professors, it felt like  they were anything but supportive. Looking back and speaking with  other people about the graduate experience and seeing how they treated  other people sometimes, I wonder if that is just part of the graduate  experience, is that kind of the MO is to break the student. That sure  seemed like a poor way to have an art experience, to me, because I was  ending up needing to express   a lot of times art comes from a  vulnerable place, and it really was a poor place to be doing that. I can   t  remember what exactly you asked me.  Just about your art experiences.  Okay, yes. It was very difficult. Some awesome things came from it, too,  because I had the opportunity to use video. Again, I did all self-portrait  stuff, and I loved the sound booth. I made this long video. I think I really  ended up struggling so much with my identity when I was there. The  mascot was so pervasive and so troubling, and I felt like I wasn   t getting  any cultural support at all.  15  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  I made this big, it was a very tortured video, really. (Laughs) In fact, it  was so tortured that when I showed it to the class, everyone attacked me.  I think it touched them so deeply that it freaked everyone out because it  was quite a moving experience. I think because of some of the  insecurities I was having about my photo skills and also because I   d  been moving into 3D, I started doing installation when I was there, too,  and video. I was enjoying the video more than the still photography, and  the installation more, and I was also introduced to computers and  Photoshop there, and I really was enjoying that a lot.  But not doing anymore jewelry classes there?  No. They did have a graduate jewelry program there, and there was talk  of me trying to get into it. I was still making jewelry when I was there,  and I was actually filling commissions from people, small commissions.  I had studio space, and I had my jeweler   s bench. I brought my jeweler   s  bench with me. Before I had the studio space, I had a garage that I was  working out of. Then once I got the space, I moved the bench into there,  and I did fill some small commissions.  So were the commissions from people that you knew?  Yes, it was other students.  Okay.  But I never did take a jewelry class. I think some of my jewelry was  interesting, but I think I had an inflated sense of how far I was along in  my jewelry expression.  So you didn   t quite finish out the program there. Is that correct?  I did not. I stayed for a year and a half, and I   d had enough.  What did you do then?  Tried not to have a nervous breakdown. I think I did, anyway.  (Laughter) I fell apart. Is that something I want to reveal in this  interview? I left. I actually packed up and moved to Tulsa and was here  for a while and then moved back to Santa Fe for a while and then moved  back here.  Now, were you starting to get your work into shops, your jewelry into  shops, or doing shows at that point?  16  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  I was starting to do shows. I think the first Indian art show I did was the  Tulsa Indian Art Festival. I   m trying to think if when I did that was right  after   was that right after I had left the Institute? For some reason I  remember having all my jewelry equipment in my car and setting it up in  one of my aunt   s garages here in Tulsa and that I hadn   t moved here yet.  I don   t know what the deal was with that, but I do know my first show  was at Tulsa Indian Art Festival for Indian art show. I   m trying to think  if that was the first time I was selling jewelry that way. I can   t  remember.  When did you win your first competitive award for jewelry?  I think it was at the Tulsa Indian Art Festival.  Was it that same first show that you did?  It may have been.  Was it a first place?  It seems like it was a second. I think it was a second place.  So how did that impact you?  I was probably excited, but honestly I don   t remember. All that just  seems too hazy to pull that particular thing out.  As you started moving into doing shows, how do you think your jewelry  was different from that of other jewelers?  I guess, you know, the jewelry looks so different in the Indian art world  in general, compared to jewelry outside that.  Because of materials and approaches or     That   s part of it, and I think also there   s often repetition of design. I  knew my work was different already. I was using alternative materials. I  was already using Plexiglas. My work didn   t look like the work I   d been  looking at or other Indian jewelers    work. Whether I was conscious of it  or not, it was already more contemporary.  And you really hadn   t been looking at other non-Native jewelry very  much, either.  I had not. There were lots of time periods where I didn   t even look at  other art. I knew it was different, and it was different. I think, also,  17  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  probably one of the great things about going to the Institute was nobody  ever told me no. I think one time Lane said,    It might be kind of hard to  do that,    but I was like,    So?    (Laughter) That was a very nurturing  environment. There were a lot of great people there when I was there  doing very creative things. Honestly, yes, I didn   t have the sense that I  couldn   t do something yet.  So were you working a job part-time while you were making your  jewelry when you were back in Tulsa?  I was. I   d got a job at MotoPhoto, and I was doing that for quite a while.  Then a family friend introduced me to the world of temporary work, and  I started doing quite a lot of that. There   s a funny story with that because  growing up I had a very dear friend, my next door neighbor, Karen.  Sometimes it was just the two of us. Sometimes my sister would be  there, too.  She was kind of the surprise baby for her parents, so all the other kids  were gone part of the time that we knew one another. Her older sister   s  bedroom was no longer occupied, and it was big. We set up what we  thought of as a store in there, like everything in the room was for sale,  and we called it Boatinsky   s Everything Shop. Don   t ask me where we  got that. (Laughter) We were constantly taking phone calls for orders,  and we made order slips. It was like playing office, and we   re rubber  stamping everything. (Laughter) When I started doing temporary work,  it was fun. It was a little nerve-wracking to be going to a new job all the  time, but it was like playing office, and I really liked that.  So were you doing any Native shows beyond the Festival, or were you  just trying all kinds of shows?  It seems like I was trying to show anywhere I could. For a little while I  showed with Linda Greever at the Art Market here in Tulsa. I remember  doing this horrible little festival. I did little festival things, too, at the  Cookson Hills. Oh, it was a complete flop, sold nothing, and it rained. It  was horrible. At that point, I was hauling around my kitchen table to  show my jewelry.  I think I set up one time at the fairgrounds. That was not profitable. Was  anybody else showing my stuff? Oh, I thought I was going to be  showing with   there used to be a little gallery in Brookside. It was a co-op  gallery. I think one of the people with the co-op had seen my work  because it seems like I   d been invited to come in for something.  I showed up with my jewelry and was told that either they had invited  someone else or I was no longer wanted. I mean, it was horrible.  18  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  (Laughs) Thankfully, I just picked myself up and walked across the  street to this boutique called Mango and Salsa and said,    Can I show my  jewelry here?    She said yes, and so she had my jewelry for a little while.  As you were starting out doing Native art shows, and as you say, your  jewelry is a very different look from a lot of other Native jewelry, did it  take the public a while to come around? What was a series that you  started to do that just really sold for you?  Well, you know, my family had been supportive. My aunt had bought  some pieces from me. I think it was when I got the opportunity to take a  job in Santa Fe with, I think it was the Native American something Film  Festival. It only lasted for two years. I was brought in to   it seems like I  was volunteer coordinator. I was offered that job. I was living here in a  space that I really loved, but it seemed like a good opportunity, and I  picked up and moved out there and took the job.  Gosh, did it last for three months, maybe? Then I was like,    What am I  going to do?    I had some friends, one of whom is a jeweler, her and her  husband. She   s been extremely successful. It   s Shawn Bluejacket. She  told me,    Heidi, why don   t you go get a part-time job at a hotel, and then  you can work on your jewelry part-time, and then go up to the flea  market and sell your work on the weekends.     I thought that was a good idea, and so I got a job at a hotel in Santa Fe  part-time and started. I had a studio in one of the bedrooms of   I think I  had a townhome or something I was living in. I remember making these  birdhouse shapes out of, I think it was copper and silver and maybe tin.  You know,  the Genetic Memory series of dresses  may have been  before I went out to Santa Fe. That   s where it may have started, was here  in Tulsa. I don   t know where I got the inspiration, but I made some of  those dresses, and they were more crude then. They were not as soft.  The lines weren   t.  The lines weren   t as soft. The edges weren   t as soft. They just weren   t as  refined. I had gotten into a little show on the East Coast. It was like  women artists only or something. I had sent several of those in. Back  then what I was doing, I was doing them all kinds of ways. I had things  hanging off the bottom, and a copper dress with some silver wire that  was stitched through the center of it, and beads were on the end, just all  kind of different ways. Then I think I just kept making them when I was  in Santa Fe, and they got more and more refined. When I was there, I  remember making a copper pair with a little pair of hands hanging off  the ends, silver hands. I was more creative with them.  19  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Were you using the horse hair in Santa Fe?  Sometimes, but not all the time. Yes.  And were you thinking of them as a series? Had you given them a title?  Oh, you know what? It actually really started in graduate school because  when I was there I was having such a disturbing time with the faculty  and the culture there that I really was having an identity crisis. I  remember wanting to communicate that I felt like I knew things that I  was born knowing. No one had to teach me them. I knew them from my  genetics. I remember making some pieces with my own hair, wrapping  copper wire around it and putting them in a frame. Nobody got it at all,  and it seems when I look back it   s almost a continuation of that because  the series is called Genetic Memory series. That was when the struggle  with that started, trying to communicate that.  What do you consider your most important award for your jewelry to  date?  Oh my gosh. Well, even though I   m not sure who nominated me for the  Helen Hardin scholarship, that feels very important. I   m trying to think.  I   ve gotten an honorable mention at the Heard  Museum . I guess  probably a close second would be I got a second place in 2011 at Indian  Market, and I literally started crying. (Laughter) That was important to  me, but I think that scholarship, too, because     Was that for a pin or a bracelet?  The Indian Market?  Yes.  It was a pin. It was a pin.  And you haven   t been doing Indian Market all that long, have you?  No.  How many years has it been?  Was it only my second time? I haven   t been doing it very long, so  second or third.  It seems like there   s always been this really strong subtext if not overt  message about political and social issues in your work. How do you  20  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  think that these get reflected in your jewelry? Jewelry seems like a place  where     It wouldn   t belong or it couldn   t fit in or        it couldn   t fit in, right.  It   s funny that you say that, but I guess it really is that. It has that  sensibility to it. Some of my work that I   ve done, I   ve been able to be a  little more literal about it because I think a lot of what I do is really tiny  sculpture. For a while, (I don   t know if it was two years) I started  making these, almost, text boxes. I was making boxes out of silver and  then putting in a thing of text. I have a couple of old, manual  typewriters, so I can really make it look cool, putting little slips of paper  in there or fabric, and then covering it with Plexiglas, and then pushing  the bezel around it.  With that, I was able to literally communicate stuff. That   s been a way  for me to do that. If I really want to say something outright with my  other work, in a sense, I guess that, you know, the Genetic Memory  series is saying something really more artfully and not as literally, but  that   s there, too.  I   ve also seen your work described as whimsical, which I think it really  does have this whimsy to it. Why is that important to you?  I don   t know that it   s so much that it   s important to me, but that   s just  what it is. It seems like that   s just what it is, without me really thinking  about it. That must be part of my personality because I think a lot of  times it does come through. I   m not thinking about it; it just comes out.  How much of your work is commissions, and how much of your income  is derived from booth shows? Is it about half and half?  Booth and gallery, I would say, is probably at least 80 percent if not  more. I actually really don   t enjoy commissions very much, probably  because I   m an artist. I want to make what I want to make. (Laughter)  The good thing about commissions sometimes is it forces me to look at  something in a different way or to make a new tool or to learn something  new or to push myself some other way. It is a fairly small part of my  income compared to the other sales.  What   s one of your most important galleries right now?  I would say my most important gallery is Four Winds Gallery in  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They   ve really done great for me. I   m in a  21  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  very, to me, a very important gallery, in Shiprock  Gallery , Santa Fe.  For whatever reason, the Four Winds Gallery is doing really great for  me.  Have they brought you out there in person for shows, too?  We talked about me going out, (were we going to do it this month, or  was it last weekend?) maybe it was even last weekend, for a holiday  show, but they were not going to cover any of my expenses, and the  sales would all be consignment. I made the decision that it wouldn   t be  cost-effective.  And then how many booth shows do you do, roughly, per year?  Five, maybe.  Major     Yes.  Your metals, I guess, have changed a little bit. We   re going to talk a bit  about your artistic approaches and techniques. What are you working  with now that   s your favorite thing?  I started a series (was it even three years ago?) called the Woodland  Dreams series, and that continues to keep my wheels turning a little bit  in the studio. I   m Shawnee, and my tribe was originally a Woodlands  tribe. I started trying to look at anything that was from that area, that  culture area, and a lot of it is floral and leaf motifs.  I was looking especially at bandolier bags and got a lot of inspiration  from that. I   m still continuing to look at that and think about it. I most  recently had checked out a really thick book about trees from the library.  I was looking at trees that grew in my tribal region. One of my most  recent things I did from that series was a pair of earrings. They were  gold and chrysoprase. I called them Sassafras Leaf Earrings because I  had done little sassafras leaves with the cabochon hanging down from  the bottom of the leaf.  Neat. Do you think in terms of titles for just series or also individual  pieces? Do you always have kind of a title in mind?  I don   t always. With the Woodland Dreams series, quite a bit of it was  just, like, Necklace Number 1, Necklace Number 2, and then some of  them were individual, like Japonica Earrings or Sassafras Leaf  Earrings. I did some maidenhair fern, oak leaf. Some of them were more  22  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  individual. Then some of the political pieces I   ve done, I   ve taken their  titles from the text in the box if they have a text box.  Do you want to explain what the japonica is? That   s been popular. I   ve  seen you selling quite a bit of that.  That is a five-petal flower that grows on the japonica shrub. That was  probably the beginning of the Woodland Dreams series because I  honestly don   t know if those grow in that area. (Laughter) I walk my  dogs every day, and that   s one of the first things that blooms in the  spring. I just had, like, zeroed in on looking at flora and fauna and  thought,    Wow, wouldn   t that be a cool, that five-petal.    I   ve also been  doing some five-petal things that I   m calling Strawberry Flower because  that   s a big motif for Woodlands, and so I   ve been doing some  strawberry flower things also.  What other kinds of research do you do besides what you   ve mentioned,  walking, I guess, and then books? What other kinds of research do you  do?  Well, one of the things I do when I really get stuck is I have several old  encyclopedias in my studio. I might   ve even have picked them up out of  the garbage. Some, I think, came from an actual garage sale, but nobody  wants those anymore. I will just start looking through the encyclopedia,  literally, and sometimes I will get ideas that way. Sometimes it   s from     I was pretty upset when George W. Bush was president about a lot of  political issues. That was a big inspiration for a series of work.  (Laughter)  What series was that?  One of them was Habeas Corpses. I only ended up with one thing from  that series. (Laughter) And then the other was   there was not a title, but  it was all about that. There were several pieces that came out of it. One  of them was (I still have it, actually) the    terror alert level.    I used the  colors and the words from that to make a necklace that I called  Insecurity Blanket. Then there was a piece that I did, actually, it was for  a show. I did it for a humor show in Norman, and it was called The Devil  and His Dog, and it was Cheney and Bush. It was a pin, but it laid down  on a dog bed that I made. (Laughter)  Do you sketch things out before you try a design? Do you do a lot of  sketching?  I do. I do a lot of sketching. I guess, probably, I have a lot better drawing  skill than the average person, and I just think I   m not very good. I can at  23  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  least get something enough that I know what I   m making. I actually have  gotten more and more particular about taking pretty detailed notes on my  work. That way if I need to go back and see how I made the piece  because I want to make a similar one, or like recently, something came  back to me from the gallery for a repair, I was able to look it up and say,     Okay, I do have all the pieces.     So you   re taking notes on the process?  I take notes on the process, and I take notes on how many of each  component and the measurements and weight and all that.  I think I remember at some point you switched from your dad   s name,  your surname, to your grandma   s name. Is that right?  Yes.  What made you decide to     You know, I think part of it was I needed to legitimize myself more  somehow in the Indian art world. It was probably an insecurity issue.  Part of it was also a pride issue. It was important to me. My Indian  identity was so much more important to me. It seemed like a good idea  to have that out. Then, because my grandmother was still alive, I was  able to ask her about it, which was, I thought, good.  I guess I haven   t looked closely at your signature. I always admire the  jewelry. Do you have a particular   we   ll see it on video, hopefully.  Oh a hallmark on my work?  Your hallmark, yes.  I   ll do two different things. I   ll either sign my name with a lower-case H,  just    heidi,    or (I got this idea from another artist, but I thought it was a  good one) I use an H and a B and stamp it.  What   s been one of the best business tips that you got from another  artist?   Ben and Barbara Harjo have helped me enormously in terms of  connections with artists, friends, and shows.  I   ve gotten some good tips  on pricing. I   ve had issues with not charging enough for my work, and  I   ve needed some help on that. I think I really did get some valuable  advice from Shawn Bluejacket and her husband on getting started. I  think, you know, when I look at the overall scope of trying to do what  24  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  I   m doing, I feel like I   ve gotten sort of a good living example from a lot  of the artists I know because I never thought to myself,    Oh, there   s no  way I can do this.    Nobody at the Institute ever said,    There   s no way  you can   t make your living as an artist or just be an artist.     Now, when I meet people outside this world, so often people look at me  like,    Really?    So it   s good that I wasn   t listening to those kinds of  voices in the beginning because I think there are a lot of people   a lot of  nay saying. I guess that   s what I   m getting at.  So what is your creative process from the time you get an idea? How  does it unfold?  I don   t know. Probably I start making sketches, or with some things I   ll  make a photocopy of something and then shrink it down. Metals have  gotten so expensive that whereas I would   ve been really quick to try to  almost make a prototype of something in the beginning, I don   t want to  do that now unless I   m going to try to make something out of copper  first. A lot of my things are so labor intensive that I really don   t even  want to do that. I guess a lot of it   s internal, just trying to reason it out.  I think I heard a story on NPR one time, and it was talking about how  maybe the outside world doesn   t realize the extent to which artists are  problem solvers because, I mean, it   s just a problem a minute     (Laughter)  Exactly.     and I   m out there trying to solve it before I get started. Then  sometimes my process is   sometimes I get scared. I   m so scared to do  something that it might take me a couple months until I even get my  hand into it at all.  What   s your creative routine? Do you work in the morning as opposed  to night, or do you work a certain numbers of hours a day?  I   ve been slacking a lot recently. (Laughs) My ideal routine would be to  get out to my studio about nine or ten in the morning. A lot of times it   s  not until noon or one if I have things to do in the morning. Then I tend to  work until about eight at night, unless I   m under some kind of deadline  and I need more hours. Then I come in, and I   m done for the night. I   m  not a person who stays up all night working. I   m not that kind of a  worker. That   s usually my routine.  Well, looking back on your career so far, what was a real turning point  for you when you might   ve gone one way but you chose to go another?  25  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Oh, last month. (Laughter) It seems like I have a crisis about three times  a year. Oh, gosh. I guess I   ve been at the verge of not doing this  anymore so many times because it is so hard. I don   t know what keeps  me going, something internal in one way  or  another. I think, to me,   the dilemma is  one way or another way, a lot of times is    Am I going  to go out and try to get a full-time job somewhere, or am I going to get  in the studio and make stuff because I know there   s money out there for  me if I will make the work? Somebody   s going to buy it.    That   s really a  fear thing, I guess. That   s pretty frequent.  What   s been one of the high points of your career so far? It might be  something you mentioned, but     Last year was awesome career-wise I think because my sales were so  good. I hate to link having a great year with that, but really it was very  helpful. I made a piece for a show   I   m trying to think if there are other  galleries in Seattle   it   s called Velvet Da Vinci. I made a piece for a  show; it was an anti-war metal show. It was when the Iraq War was still  going on. It was a scary piece to make because it was quite  controversial, really. It ended up getting reviewed in, I think it was  Metalsmith magazine, and I didn   t even know it   I had asked an instructor at OSU to help me with a technique. I had gone  there that day, and he congratulated me. I said,    For what?    (Laughter) I  couldn   t believe it. I can   t remember if it was when we broke for lunch  or if it was that evening, but I, of course, ran to a bookstore and bought  all the copies that they had.  That   s cool. Who was the instructor?  I   m so embarrassed. I   m not remembering his last name  Ramsay . His  first name is Chris. He   s very well-known, very talented.  So what   s been one of the low points of your career so far?  Oh, whenever I have a crisis  (Laughter) Gosh, it   s like,    Can I pick  one?    A low point. Well, I mean, I guess there   s been times I   ve been  going through things in my personal life where I feel like,    How can I  keep doing this?    In some ways, that was last year, also. Yet, it seems  like, I feel like, when the most terrible things have happened, those are  the times when a lot of great work comes out.  I don   t mean that in the sense that I think I have to be in crisis all the  time to make great work, because I don   t, but even out of a hard time,  good things can come out in my work. I would say it   s just a constant  struggle. It   s like this (gesturing). I hope that someday it   s going to be  26  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  more like this (gesturing), always, you know, for all the time. (Laughs)  Is there anything else you   d like to add or anything we forgot to talk  about before we look at your work?  I guess that the work I do, the two-dimensional paper work I do, the  collage work is really important to me. I don   t do it a lot, but it   s  extremely personal, and it   s a way that I   m unable to communicate  through the metal. I am able to communicate through my paper, my  collage work, so that   s important to me, too.  Yes, I think we should get a picture of one of your collages, too. All  right, we   ll get ready to set that up to look at your work. Would you like  to tell us about this piece?  This is one of the pieces I mentioned in the interview. This is the    terror  alert level necklace,    which I titled Insecurity Blanket. Some of it   s  computer-generated text, which I had   oh, what do they call that? It was  iron-on transfer onto this colored muslin. I had to find the fabric and  make all my silver boxes and put the fabric in and the Plexiglas on top  and then bezel set. Another added dimension is, of course, like for a lot  of tribes, our ceremonial wear is made out of this calico, so there   s  another dimension to this.  That   s neat.  Some of the inspiration for this necklace is obviously the terror alert  level and the colors. I remember thinking when I would hear on the  radio,    It   s a severe day,    or    a high level day    or    elevated,    I never felt  any better about it. It was to let me know it was going on, but I never felt  any better. I think that   s part of the reason I got the idea for the title,  Insecurity Blanket.  Right.  These are some of the Genetic Memory series pieces. I   ve kind of gotten  to the point where I   m not doing all kinds of things with it anymore. It   s  really refined down to several different patterns that I use in the stamp  work, and this is one of them. Of course,  horse hair  in the middle and  the patina and the stamp work, so it   s just the dress shape.  And the earrings. Would you like to tell us about these?  These are part of the Woodland Dreams series. These are obviously  earrings, and I think I mentioned in my interview that I   ve been using  Plexiglas. Thermoplastic is kind of the generic term. These are green  27  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  Little Thunder  Bigknife  thermoplastic with fourteen-carat ear wires, and this is the japonica  shape, japonica earring.  And this is one of your collages.  This is one of my collages. This is torn paper on watercolor paper, and I  do a lot of torn paper on watercolor paper for my collage work.  Sometimes I will add pencil or Cray-Pas, but a lot of times it   s just paper  on paper. This piece is called Undecision. I was having to make a  decision about an important relationship to me, whether it was time to  end it or not. I was really struggling with that. I can explain more, but     Whatever you   re comfortable with.  This was a relationship that I was having a struggle with, deciding  whether or not it was time to end it. The collage work, I think, is very  helpful for me to access feelings like that, deep things that I   m trying to  work out but don   t seem to come out in any other way.  It looks like a profile, almost, from a distance, but that   s actually an  older photograph of you, or just     It   s actually from a magazine, so it   s very anonymous.  It   s an arm.  It   s an arm and a hand and a shoulder from a woman.  Right. All right, well, thank you very much for your time today, Heidi.  Thank you, Julie.  -------  -------
