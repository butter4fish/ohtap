 Ahrberg and today is October 15, 2009. I am visiting  with Mary Eva Nemecek Johnson in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This  interview is for the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. Welcome.  Thank you.  We   re going to talk a little bit about WOW, which is the Women of  Willard. I want you to start off and tell me about your early life, where  you grew up, your family, and your school.  I was born in Noble, Oklahoma. My mother had graduated from college  two years before my dad did and they had married before he finished  and so we stayed at my grandparents for the first nine months of my life.  And then my parents moved to Fort Supply, Oklahoma. My dad was  given a job   he hadn   t even graduated yet, but because it was getting  close to war times, many of the young men were going to the Army so  he got a job early. He worked at Western State Hospital at Fort Supply  and so that   s where I lived from the time I was nine months old until I  left for college.  I went to school in Fort Supply. It was small enough that all twelve  grades were in one building. I was in a class of seventeen in high school.  The main thing that I was involved in all through elementary school and  high school was 4-H. I was a lifetime 4-H member and that was a big  part of my life. My dad was an expert with pigs and so my brother and  sister and I showed pigs at the fairs and the stock shows, as well as all  the Home Ec things. My mother was a Home Ec major, also, so she  taught me to sew. A lot of times I   ve said everything I know I learned  from my mother, so she was a big influence in my life, too.  What kind of pigs? Were they Rockport or   ?  5  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Different kinds. Duroc was my dad   s main love. But I had a pig that was  a Hampshire that was a Grand Champion, a Stock Show Grand  Champion. So that was sort of my favorite because he did the best.  (Laughter)  So you attended all twelve years in one school building?  Yes, I did.  How big was your high school graduating class?  Seventeen. There were twelve girls and five boys. I also played  basketball, I forgot to mention that. Virginia, who you just got through  interviewing, went to another school so I had known her through playing  basketball and all even before we graduated. But, you know, there   s not  a whole lot to do in very small towns so basketball and 4-H were kind of  the main things I was involved in.  Did a lot of girls play sports at that time?  Nearly all of them did because there wasn   t much else to do. No  organizations to speak of.  What influenced you to attend OSU and what year did you enroll?  Oh, my goodness. My dad had attended here and I knew I wanted to  major in Home Ec. So I just knew from the time I was about six years  old this is where I was going to come to school. My mother was a  graduate of Oklahoma University so we   ve been a divided family from  way, way back. And because of my 4-H relationship with Oklahoma  State, I just knew this was where I was coming. I enrolled here in the fall  of 1955.  What were your first impressions of the campus and of the town of  Stillwater?  I had been very active in 4-H and I had been on the campus quite a few  times visiting here for 4-H Roundup, so I was familiar with the campus  to some extent and I wasn   t overwhelmed. It seemed big compared to  the high school I went to, but I felt like I kind of knew my way around a  little bit. As far as the town of Stillwater, I really didn   t know the town  because nobody had a car back then so we were pretty much confined to  the campus. I went to the Methodist church downtown but we always  got a ride with somebody, and I wouldn   t even be able to tell you where  that was located. (Laughs)  6  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  What years did you live in Willard Hall?  From 1955 to    59.  Were you assigned to Willard Hall or did you specifically request  Willard?  I don   t remember that. I   m assuming we were assigned there. Virginia  and I had applied to be roommates ahead of time so that   s all I knew,  that we would be roommates. I didn   t know where we would live.  What were your first impressions of Willard Hall?  I can just remember   oh goodness, having to go down the hall to go to  the bathroom, and I thought the living rooms were so beautiful. The  cafeteria I can remember we couldn   t wear pants except Saturdays and  breakfast, so that was kind of different. Freshmen had to be in at eight  o   clock so there were just lots of things that were kind of new to get  used to there.  What was your room like?  The room that we lived in freshman year was in the center section and it  was small. It was during the time of big full skirts and petticoats and the  closets were so tiny that there wasn   t room for those, so we hung them  on the pipes that were in the corners. You know, the steam pipes up in  the corners, that   s where we hung our petticoats. Then after the second  year we moved around to one of the wings of Willard Two and that   s  where this group got together that have stayed friends for so long. We  had a corner room then and we thought that was huge. Since I   ve seen it  later I thought it   s really not as big as I thought, but at the time we  thought it was big. (Laughter)  What was it like trying to have a personal conversation on the floor  phone?  Oh goodness, you know I don   t remember that so much. I think about  the only time I ever used the phone was downstairs at the payphone  when I   d call my parents to tell them when I got home, got back here  safely or something. I don   t think I used the floor phone a lot.  Was there a common shower and restroom area on your floor?  Yes, yes.  And how many women would you say shared that facility and what was  7  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  that like for you?  Well, it was partly just inconvenient. Of course at that time there were  no men allowed on that floor, so you didn   t have to be quite as covered  up to go down the hall. But oh goodness, I would say there were  probably two or three bathtubs and maybe five or six showers. I think  just our end of the wing shared that particular bathroom. I don   t have  any idea how many women that was, but it didn   t seem to be much of a  problem.  Was Willard considered to be a popular or prestigious hall at that time?  We thought so. We thought we were the best. (Laughter)  Well, why would you say that?  I don   t know. Just because we had such good camaraderie with the girls  we lived with. I think we just had a lot of confidence and were enjoying  life so much there that we just thought well we   re the best dorm. Really  Willard, Stout, and Murray were about the only ones where women lived  so we didn   t have a whole lot of competition.  You talk about competition. Did you play each other in intramural  sports or anything between the other women dorms?  I don   t know that it was dorms. I played on some intramural basketball  and some intramural volleyball, but the volleyball I was with was co-ed  volleyball and I think it was more of a Wesley Foundation team than it  was a dorm team.  In your mind, what set Willard apart from the other women   s halls in the  late 1950s, which is kind of what we   ve been talking about, but you  mentioned it   s the women, you think? Was it the facility? Was the facility  better?  I don   t think the facility was that much different than the others.  Actually, I was never in the others that much but I don   t think there  would have been a lot of difference. We thought, you know, we were  closer to the Union, we were closer to Theta Pond. It was really close to  the Classroom Building, it was easy to get to places. But I think more it  was   it   s kind of like the town you live in. It   s the people as much as it  is the town.  Was the term WOW popularly used in the 1950s?  I don   t think so.  8  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  When was it first used?  I really wasn   t even familiar with it until you mentioned that it was  Women of Willard.  I   d like to discuss some of the WOW traditions with you. What was the  Willard Beach and where did that take place?  The Willard Beach? That   s not something familiar. One thing that I  remember about living in Willard is my freshman year our room  overlooked the balcony and so when it got sunshiny in the spring, girls  would come through our room, crawl out the window and lay out on the  balcony roof to sunbathe. So we had a popular room because people  would come through there.  Did you have some Christmas traditions there at Willard?  Not that I remember because back then everybody was going home  pretty much before the real Christmas got there.  So, they didn   t bring in a tree or anything like that?  No, I don   t remember. I don   t even remember what was down in the  living room.  Did Willard participate in Homecoming events and contests?  I don   t remember us ever decorating. Some people may have better  memory than I do, but that   s not something that sticks out to me.  Can you recall anything about when one of the WOW members became  engaged? Did they have a candlelight  vigil  or did you     Well, unless they were engaged to somebody from a fraternity, it seemed  like it wasn   t such a big deal. There   s three of the group that are a year  older than me, and so two of them married right after they graduated but  I don   t remember any engagement part with those particular ones.  Virginia, I remember, but she was in a sorority by then. She was still  part of our group but in the sorority so our group didn   t have anything  special for her.  Now you stayed all four years in Willard?  Yes.  Do you recall anything about the Willard scrapbooks that they had?  9  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  You mean dorm scrapbooks? I   m not familiar with that. Nearly every  one of us kept our own scrapbooks. I think I see Virginia   s over there  and I have a couple at home that have lots of pictures and little  invitations and whatever. There probably were scrapbooks down in the  living room that I may have seen, but it doesn   t strike a big memory.  What did you hear about the 1955 panty raid on Willard?  Two of the girls that are going to be here   it   s alright if I call us girls,  right? Fifty years later...  Yes, of course.     were there and they told us about it and how scared they were and got  us all scared that it might happen again. (Laughter) You know, we were  such na  ve little freshmen. But that was about the only thing I heard  about it. They did get into Willard and I think these two, I think maybe  their room had gotten entered because it was a corner room. But they  were so scared, that   s just the main thing I remember them talking about.  Do you know what caused it?  No.  What were the resident hall hours when you were on campus?  When we were freshmen, we had to be in at eight o   clock. After that we  had to be in by 10:30, I think, except maybe Friday and Saturday night  we could stay out till maybe eleven, midnight. I don   t remember for  sure. I just know it was later than eight o   clock.  Do you remember what the penalties were for coming in late or past the  curfew?  I don   t know that anything really terrible happened. We all thought it  was going to be. You know, we had to ring the doorbell and get a little  chewing out by whoever was the night house mother. I think their bluff  was worse than their bite. But I didn   t ever stay out too late so I don   t  really know what the consequences were.  Did they come down the halls with a flashlight and knock on your  doors? How did that work for checking the rooms, making sure you were  in?  I   m not sure about the checking in. I just remember sometimes we   d  hear them come down the hall if we were having a party or having  10  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  popcorn or doing something and staying up a little too late and maybe  making too much noise. We   d hear footsteps coming down the hall and  we   d get a knock on the door.  Well, that   s interesting you bring up food in the rooms. How did you  cook the popcorn?  I had a popcorn popper that had a removable pan that we popped  popcorn in and we heated soup in it.  So, you were allowed to do that, to bring     Well, I guess. We never were told we couldn   t. But we didn   t have like  hot plates or microwaves or refrigerators, anything like that. I think my  little popcorn popper is     But you were allowed to cook in the room, at least.  Yes.  Was there a dress code in the hall?  Yes. We weren   t allowed to wear pants of any kind except on Saturday  and breakfast. So I can remember my legs getting very cold sometimes  walking across campus in the wintertime.  Was PDA, public display of affection, a serious infraction in the dorms?  I don   t think I ever saw any except just in the entryway in between the  outside door and the inside door, which was kind of this little cubicle  about as wide as this rug here. That   s about the only place that  happened.  And was there a penalty if they got caught?  No, I don   t think so because we weren   t actually inside the dorm.  Do you remember anything about your dorm mom? When you came in  did you eat at her table? Did you have any kind of contact with her?  No, not anything specific that I can remember.  Any kind of impression about her?  Well, the daytime I just vaguely remember she was a short matronly  lady, a sweet lady. The night one was the one we were afraid of.  11  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Oh there was more than one?  Well there was one that was on duty at night.  Did they actually live in the dorm with you all?  I don   t know that. I really don   t know. But she was more stern. Of  course, she had to be the one to enforce the night rules and stuff. We  were kind of afraid of her.  What were some of the special hall events and activities that you  remember?  We had dances. I   m not sure how often they were, maybe monthly. They  were just casual dances down in the basement and boys would come  over and sometimes that   s how you would meet somebody. They just  knew that Willard Hall   s dance was a certain night. Then we also  participated in the Follies a few times. We had a skit. I remember one of  the girls who was a year behind me. She was quite talented and so she  helped us one year work up a skit. We didn   t do it   well we might have  done it every year; I wasn   t involved every year. But I know we did that.  So, did you have tryouts then, I guess?  Yes.  In addition to these, where there some personal or special memories of  your years at Willard Hall that really stand out for you?  Well, the most personal thing that I remember is sometime in the wee  hours when I got a knock on the door it was somebody tapping me for  Mortar Board. I mean that was very special because I had known some  of the girls as I was younger, knowing who some of the girls that were in  Mortar Board were and I thought, oh my gosh, look at those. And then  all of a sudden, here I was. So, that was very special. Another thing that  was a lot of fun was one year during Western Week a bunch of us  dressed up real crazy. I mean we dressed western and we did some kind  of crazy   we had poker games and smoked cigars and did some things  that we would never do somewhere else. (Laughs) But I mean just in our  own rooms and just had a lot of fun.  Well, tell us about Western Days, I   ve not heard of that one.  I   m not sure what all happened except we were allowed to wear jeans  and western clothes and whatever.  12  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  It was campus-wide?  It was campus-wide. And I think it was maybe a couple of days or  maybe a long weekend or something. And maybe there was a rodeo  going. I don   t know all of it. I just know that we always dressed western.  It was our only chance to wear jeans.  So, how were the laundry facilities? Did you have it in the dorm?  They were down in the basement.  How much did it cost to do the laundry?  I don   t think it cost.  You just went down and were able to use it?  Yes, but we had to have our own soap.  You talked about some of the fun times during Western Week. Were there  any tough times for you in Willard that you recall or any incident that  was negative for you or an even that happened maybe to someone in  Willard while you were there?  You know, if there was something like that it   s gone from my memory.  Because just looking over the four years as a whole, it was just great.  You know, it was really a wonderful time.  Was there diversity in Willard? Were there any ethnic or international  students?  Do you know, I   ve mentioned recently that I can remember one girl who  was African American that was a friend, not real close, but she was with  our group sometimes and I think she was a Home Economics major so I  had more contact with her. I   ve often thought, I wonder what it was like  for her because I think one time I saw her on campus with a boy that  wasn   t African American and I thought, oh my. You know, because she  was just one of us in the dorm and there just weren   t any other girls and  I thought it must be tough for her because     Did people eat with her in the cafeteria?  Oh yes, I mean she was accepted. She was just one of us. And I don   t  remember   I know there were some foreign students there but I don   t  remember any of them being in our dorm that I would have known  about.  13  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Were you active in Willard Hall or the OSU women   s residence hall  associations? Like did you hold a hall or floor position the time you  were there?  No. I was active in other organizations other than that, but no.  So, you didn   t work there either.  No. My dad decided I should concentrate on school and not work.  Well, can you tell us why you think the WOW women have stayed so  close through the years and continue to have reunions even fifty years  later?  Well, I heard Virginia   s answer to that, and I would answer almost the  same. One time I did a graphic just to, kind of, see what happened. And  of the, oh, eighteen, twenty of us that we consider our group, the very  one that almost everyone fit into was from a small town. I would say  probably two-thirds of us were Home Ec majors. Probably at least half  of us went to the Wesley Foundation. A lot of us had been in 4-H and  had that background. I don   t know. It was just kind of like there were  just so many commonalities among us from one way or the other.  Something that allowed you to bond and keep that bond.  Yes. But for some reason we think the small town thing might have had  something to do with it. We didn   t have that big city mentality.  This group of women that you formed this bond with, you all lived on the  same floor?  Yes, we were all Willard Two girls. And there was some competition  between Willard Four and Willard Two. I can   t remember exactly what  started that. (Laughter) But no, we were all Willard Two.  How many reunions have you participated in and where?  I think I   ve been to all except one. The first one was at Lake Lugert over  at Altus in    69. I won   t remember the years so much, but we went to  Lake Arrowhead and Roman Nose. We went to Lake Fort Gibson. I  can   t remember even what that   s called because that   s where we went on  our honeymoon, but it   s Lake Fort Gibson. Then we had the reunion in  Colorado in 2002 and then 2007 in Oklahoma City. There were five of  us who got together in Phoenix one summer.  In the beginning were you able to meet often or maybe because of  14  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  raising your children and stuff     Well, at the beginning we met, we tried to make it like every five years.  We would have like two volunteers to be the planners and organizers for  the next one. And so we did that I guess for about three reunions were  every five years. So, that would   ve been what,    74,    79. That   s when our  kids were little and it was fun seeing them grow up.  And so do you elect somebody to be in charge, you say?  Well, we did then. Since then we haven   t. It   s just kind of been more of  a circumstance. Virginia arranged the one we had in 2002 because it was  in Colorado where they lived. Then the one in Oklahoma City was  because some of them were going to be there for the Big 12 Tournament  and they just sent emails and said,    Why don   t we get together?    And I  know somebody arranged where we would stay and where we would eat  and I don   t know who that was, but now it   s more of a volunteer thing.  When Willard was converted to administrative use, was that  controversial with some of the Willard alumni?  Not that I know of. We were just proud of it. One thing, my brother was  an instructor here and my sister-in-law was a professor here at the time  and his office was in that building. So, that was kind of special that he  would get to be there.  Did the WOW group participate in the renovation plans of Willard? And  did they do any lobbying for maintaining the original living room spaces  on the first floor?  I   m not aware of that. The only thing I remember is just that somebody  in our group started the thing to try to have a memorial area for the two  of our group that had died. And that   s the only part that I can remember.  So, that year when we had the reunion we all went upstairs to that little  alcove and had our picture taken with it.  What do you think about the new resident hall apartments and suites on  the OSU campus? Have you been in them?  No, I haven   t. But I have a great-niece, who is a freshman here this year,  who is living in one of those somewhere. I   m supposed to call her this  afternoon.  Now, Willard wasn   t air-conditioned, was it?  No.  15  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Were there any dorms at that time air-conditioned?  Not the girls    dorms, unless the athletic dorm was, I don   t know.  (Laughs) But I have a feeling it probably wasn   t.  Did you all have house boys?  I don   t remember any.  So, when you sat down at the dinner or lunch or breakfast     We just went through a line and got a tray. It was cafeteria-style.  I   d like to ask you some general questions about your OSU experience if  that   s okay. What year did you graduate?  1959.  During your time on campus, OSU changed its name from Oklahoma  A M and joined the Big 8 Conference and became the Cowboys. How  did students generally react to these changes?  I don   t know. Probably made us feel more important, that we were a  university instead of a college. It was kind of special, I think, to be part  of both eras. My dad had been here when it was Oklahoma A M and  you know, I felt like that was a part of my legacy but then it was nice to  be in the big time.  Were there any particular classes that you especially remember that you  took? And how about any professors that really influenced you in your  life?  Well, I couldn   t believe Virginia said Mary Cox because she and I took  a lot of the same classes because we had the same major, but Mary Cox  was a wonderful professor.  What did she teach?  She was in Family Relations Child Development. I remember we had to  write a personal biography essay and I got an A+ on mine because she  felt like I was very honest and bared my soul in mine. But she was just  the kind of professor that made you happy to go to class. And there   s  another teacher that was one of my Foods teachers and I can   t remember  her name, but it was where we prepared not just meals but special  occasion things. And she was pretty influential in the way she taught and  she loved what she was doing, so she made the rest of us enjoy that, too.  16  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  What are some of the student traditions and other important activities of  your era?  Well, we were all pretty active in all the special dances that went on at  the Union. Doc Pruett took all the pictures and sometimes we   d have a  big group picture of all of us together, if we all were there. Those were  some of the main things that I remember. Some of the other things   I  was very active in the Wesley Foundation and we did a lot of social  activities and went on retreats to different places. So I remember some  of those things, too, that weren   t just the whole campus.  Where was it located it at that time?  Oh my goodness, it   s still there.  It   s still across the campus right there     Yes, just right there on the corner. I can   t tell you which street it is but  it   s just right there kind of across from Theta Pond.  What were some of the popular student hangouts on-campus and off-campus?  About the only place I ever went was the Student Union. I remember  going someplace down on Campus Corner to eat pizza for the very first  time, but I don   t remember going there a lot. About the only place I ever  went, if I had a date with a boy that had a car, we   d maybe go to the  movie somewhere. (Laughs) But mostly it was the Union or the library. I  had a lot of dates at the library.  Tell us about your experience at the library. My understanding is that  there was a dress code then that you could not enter the building unless  for women you had a skirt or dress on and the men had to wear ties or at  least have pants.  Yes, I don   t remember the tie part because I   m sure that wasn   t the case.  But my senior year I was dating a boy that was an engineering student  and he had to study all the time, so I would go over and sit and if I had  studying or read or whatever, just kind of sit with him. Then we   d go  over to the Union and dance a couple of times.  Now, the library and the Student Union were fairly new buildings on  campus at that time.  Yes, I think so.  17  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  So, they really stood out. And they were air-conditioned, right? I would  think that would have been a big draw to go in there where it was cool.  Yes.  Did you study at the library at night?  Not a lot. Not unless I was with this guy. I did most of my studying in  my room.  Did you have any assignments in the library as far as how to use it?  I remember taking a class, it was Library 101 or something, that helped  us learn how to use the library and the research facilities and so forth.  What do you remember about the Homecomings when you were a  student? Anything about the float or the house decorations?  Oh yes, they were always so amazing. I always went to the parades. And  then my senior year, because I had gotten elected to Mortar Board, we  got to ride in the parade, the Mortar Board. The men in the Key Club  rode tandem bicycles with us in the Homecoming parade so it was kind  of fun.  What other organizations were you in? You said the Wesley Foundation.  Yes, I was involved in that and then there was an organization of  Methodist women called Kappa Phi that I was pretty active in and then I  was in the Home Economics Club. I was officer a couple of times in  that. I was in Orange Quill and Orange and Black Quill. And maybe if I  looked at my scrapbooks I could think of some more things, but those  are the things I remember the most.  President Willham was president at that time. Can you recall anything  special about him or something that stood out in your mind about him as  president when you were there?  Not anything specific. I just remember we thought he was pretty  important, a pretty nice person. My dad kind of knew him, too, and so I  felt like there was a connection even though it wasn   t personal.  Did he walk the campus a lot? Did you see him going to class?  I don   t recall that. I just know he was always at any event that was going  on. He was always there.  18  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  I may have asked you this, but did Willard participate in Homecoming?  We didn   t do decorations that I can remember.  What are some of your favorite memories of your student experience?  Would it be the clubs, the friendships, the classes?  I think the friendships as much as anything. I don   t know. It just seems  like it was a wonderful era. Well, you know, it was before the Vietnam  War and student rebellions. We were maybe na  ve, I don   t know. But we  were just so happy to be there and to be involved in having a college  education. It was just a great experience.  What about television? Television was coming in at this time. Was there  a television in the dorm?  I don   t remember. The only place I remember watching television was  over in the Union. We went Sunday night to watch Maverick. (Laughs)  What about any sporting events? Did you like to go to any of the  sporting events?  Oh, yes. I loved basketball so much. They gave us tickets, but for  basketball it was only for every other game because you had A and B.  So, I was hustling to see some of the girls who didn   t care about going if  I could trade and get a basketball ticket. I went to most of the games, but  I didn   t have football at my high school so I wasn   t a big football fan.  I   ll never forget the first college wrestling match I went to. A boy  invited me to go and it was OU-OSU Bedlam. It was so exciting and so I  went to another wrestling match after that thinking it   d be like that and it  was so boring. (Laughter)  Tell us about your life since you   ve left OSU. You got your degree and  did you work?  I did. I graduated like in, what, the middle of May. I   ll back up a little  bit. I never was sure if I wanted to teach Home Ec or maybe be in  extension service. Since I   d been in 4-H I was real familiar with that. I  was not real excited about my student teaching experience. So, as soon  as I got back to campus I went over to the extension office and applied  and I got hired. So the middle of June I moved to Kingfisher and I was  an Assistant Home Demonstration Agent there for three months. It was  kind of like being an intern; I was in training. Then they transferred me  to Pauls Valley, to Garvin County, and I worked there from    59   it  would   ve been in October, I moved Halloween. I   ll never forget it was  Halloween of    59 and I stayed there until    62. That   s where I met my  19  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  husband. We married in    62 and then they transferred me to McClain  County and I was the agent. I did that for five years and by then I had a  couple of babies and decided I needed a job that didn   t take me away  from home so much. So I went back to school and got elementary  certification and so I started teaching school in 1968. And that   s what I  did for the next thirty-one years, I was an elementary teacher. We were  in Purcell for five years, then we moved to Norman and I taught there  for eleven years. And then my husband and I moved to Arizona and I  continued to teach school.  Was it hard to root for the Cowboys down there, when you taught down  at Norman?  Oh yes, it was. And both of my children went to school at OU, so you  know, I grew up in a divided household and I ended up with one also.  Do you come back for any of the Homecoming activities? Or are you  able to get back here?  The only other one I   ve been to was the year that they had the Willard  Hall dedication. It   s so interesting because that day we were just  mingling around there and I saw this woman from Norman who was my  son   s fourth grade teacher. And I said,    Oh, I       you know, I think I   d  remembered she   d gone to OSU but I didn   t know she was a Willard  Hall girl. So we had a nice little chat because it had been what, twenty-two  years since she   d been my son   s teacher.  Wow, that   s amazing.  Anyway, it was just a fun time.  Well, we   re coming to a close and I   d like to know if there   s anything  else you would like to tell us about your OSU experience.  Well, one thing that popped into my mind awhile ago is whenever I took  freshman chemistry I found out that my teacher was the same one that  my dad had had in chemistry when he was in school. I thought,    Oh  man, she must be ancient.    (Laughter) It was Ms. Gerber. Because when  I was talking, he said,    Well she was my chemistry teacher.     Oh, my gosh. Were you able to go home? Did any of the girls go home  on the weekends or anything?  Not too often. We had to depend   there were a couple of boys that went  to school here that were from another town out a little further in the  Panhandle that had to go through Fort Supply. We would check with  20  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  Ahrberg  Johnson  them when they were going and oh, probably not more than once a  month or six weeks we   d go home.  Did you communicate with your parents through telephones, writing  letters?  Oh, mostly writing because my mother was one of these people that  thought you don   t spend money on long distance calls if it   s not really  necessary. So I wrote them letters.  How did you get home? Would they come pick you up or would you just  get a ride like you said?  They   d  the boys  pick us up at the dorm and then they would drop us  off in town. My parents would meet me there. Fort Supply   s pretty  small.  Well, I think that concludes the interview unless you have anything else  you   d like to add.  I can   t think of anything in particular   just listening to Virginia, she  said a lot of things I would have said, too. When I think about Oklahoma  State, it just brings back good memories. And then my brother and  sister-in-law were here for quite a few years and I did come up once in a  while to visit them. And now we have a great-niece who   s here so, you  know, the family tradition is still going.  So, you think your parents would be proud?  I think so. I think so.  That   s really neat. Well, we appreciate you coming and sharing with us  your stories. It   s been a pleasure to meet you and it   s just great to hear  your stories.  Well, thank you, it   s been a pleasure to be here.  -------  -------
