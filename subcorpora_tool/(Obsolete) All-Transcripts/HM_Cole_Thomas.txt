Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Steak, medium well (laughter).
Speaker 1: And where do you like to vacation?
Speaker 2: I'm not really a vacation person.  I haven't taken many in my life.  Occasionally, I will go to Florida, visit friends in Florida.  I like water but I don't spend a lot of time swimming or doing things on the beach.  But most of the time I grew up, I would take vacation visiting relatives, in-laws, parents, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've been considered by my wife [HistoryMaker Brenda H. Cole] as a workaholic, so I don't take much time off.  I don't think I've ever taken a week off of a sustained period of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite phrase?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think if I had to give one it would be something like--it's not original with me but, it's, it's amazing what you can accomplish if it doesn't matter who gets the credit.
Story_ID: 569871
Speaker 1: We're gonna start the interview talking about your family history, your ancestry.  How far back can you go in your ancestry on your mother's [Eva Sharp] side?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, I can go back to her mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her mother was a dynamic, funny, very interesting woman.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Name was Josephine Redmond [ph.].  She was, I think, one-fourth Indian [Native American], Cherokee.  I believe it was Cherokee but my roots go back to Texas.  And she had high cheek bones, hair all the way down to her back, to her waist, and she lived to be ninety-five years old.  And I, I never knew my mother's father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your grandmother, she lived in--was she born and raised in Texas?
Speaker 2: Born and raised in Texas, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she, she, she spent the, the last few years of her life in Denver, Colorado.  The entire family left Texas and went to Denver, Colorado, so she, she was there until she died.
Speaker 1: Can you share any stories about you and your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I probably won't--she wouldn't want me to share and my mother wouldn't want me to share, but my grandmother was unpredictable.  And she would often just show up at the front door coming for a visit without having called ahead and warned anybody that she was coming for a visit.  And, I think probably the, the one story that stayed with me more than any other is the time when she came to visit--I was a kid, and my mother did something that I didn't like.  I don't remember exactly what it was but then I was, I was unhappy about it and I was calling her ugly names, and my grandmother, recognizing that my mother had her hands full with four children, she took care of business.  The way she used to take care of business with an ironing cord, and I will never forget that experience (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you know how much education your grandmother had?
Speaker 2: I don't think she had very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know how much she had, but I don't think she had very much.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, y- you said you didn't know much about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 569872
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about your grandparents on your father's [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] side. T- t--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew my father's father.
Speaker 1: And his name was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) H- his name was Joe, Joe Cole [Joseph Cole].  And, my, my--roots on my mother's [Eva Sharp] side were in Navasota, Texas although she was born in Center, Texas.  My father was born in Navasota, Texas.  And, so, for a period in time we lived close there and I would have a chance to visit with my father's father.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember your grandmother on your father's side?
Speaker 2: No, she had died long since, before I was born.
Speaker 1: And do you have any other information about Joe Cole?
Speaker 2: No, I don't other than his father was a full-blood Indian [Native American], at least that's how my dad described him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Back in East Texas in that region of Texas, there was a lot of intermarriage between Native Americans and, and slaves--and former slaves.  And my father described him as being almost, almost 100 percent Native American.  But, he knew him but I, I never had a chance to meet him.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know what tribe?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was Choctaw.  And the only reason I say that is I have an uncle--actually, it's a cousin who frequently refers to himself as Choctaw, so I think, I think that was it.  But, we never, you know, we've not done a very serious history on either side of my parents' sides, so it would be worth doing just to make that connection.  But we have not done that.
Story_ID: 569873
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about your mother, what is her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Eva, Eva Mae Sharp [Eva Sharp].  She was born in, in Center, Texas but lived most of her life in Vernon, Texas where I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, she was--of course you know how children are about their parents, she was the most beautiful person I ever seen.  She married my father [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] who was a principal of the high school there.  He had graduated from college and went to Vernon for his first appointment, and she was a student there and after a few years, they, they ended up getting married, so--
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother.  Did she share any stories about her childhood, where she grew up and the type of community that she grew up in?
Speaker 2: Not much.  She grew up in a large family, she had about six sisters and one brother. Most of them were born in Center, Texas but they moved, as I indicated earlier, to Vernon while she was, while she was a child.
Speaker 1: Do you know how much education she had?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She went all the way through college and had a master's degree.
Speaker 1: What college did she attend?
Speaker 2: She attended the Prairie View A and M University [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] in Texas and Wiley College in Marshall, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did she have her degree in?
Speaker 2: In teacher education, she, she taught public schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Most of the time when I was a child and then later on she managed the college bookstore at Wiley College.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, share something about your mother.  How would you describe her?
Speaker 2: She was quiet, she was very insightful, she, she died about, she died about ten years ago, now, suddenly.  It was heart failure, but no one expected it at the time.  She was an avid supporter of football.  At the time, my father was working at the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] and she was a staunch, you know, Gator [Florida Gators], Gator fan.  And, but I think probably was the kind of mother most kids would like to have, you know, she
Speaker 1: Well tell me how, how you felt about her as your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was crazy 'bout her.  And because I could almost get anything I wanted.  She was the go-between, between me and my father most of time.  And she was someone I always listened to and just felt very comfortable in her presence.  She was an excellent cook.  She could sew, she could--she grew up at a time, you know, in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], and '40s [1940s] where they had to do everything.  So, when she went to college she took home economics and so she was able to do everything.  When we were children, she would make many of our clothes.  And I realized how strong she was.  I think of the two, she was stronger than my father in terms of, of showing her expressions.  She was, she was--you never quite knew when she was hurt or when she was angry because she would keep to herself, she would--my father was more emotional.  He, he showed his emotions a little more strongly, strongly than she did.  And I think in many ways I took that characteristic from her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are some of the, the lessons learned from your mother?
Speaker 2: She was--if you said something she didn't like, she would tell you.  But she wouldn't hold it against you, she was typically willing to correct you or to do so in a way that would not embarrass you or hurt you.  She was very sensitive in that way.  But when she got angry, when she really got angry, you would know it.  She could do almost anything, she, as I said, she did the cooking and sewing and things like that but she was also good at doing manual labor.  She would do all the picture hanging around the house and something needed to be done outside, she would be the one to do that.  And so, I learned most of what I learned about, if you will, housekeeping or taking care of things around the house from her, because she would just do it.  I'll never forget the time I saw her--we didn't go to the grocery store and just buy chickens already cooked and plucked, you know, so she would wring the chicken's neck and pluck the chicken, and I learned how to do that by watching her do it.  And, but she was--I don't know that I ever felt her wrath but I knew it was there if I did something that was too far out of line.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when, what was your mother's date of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It was December 17, I think it would've been around 1918 or there about, 1917, 1918.
Story_ID: 569874
Speaker 1: All right now, your father's name?
Speaker 2: Thomas [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.], same as mine.  I'm Jr. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your father?
Speaker 2: He was, he was really the typical kind of role model.  I mean I really, I really adored my father, I really thought a lot of him.  I really thought he was smartest person in the world.  He was--and he was funny, he could tell jokes, he would have us in stiches with jokes.  He was a man of a lot of firsts in his class and his generation.
Speaker 1: What were some of his firsts?
Speaker 2: He, he was the first African American to get a--well, first of all he went to, to Wiley College [Marshall, Texas] and finished at an early age.  I think he was like twenty when he finished college, and he majored in the sciences but he was sent to Vernon, Texas to be principal of this high school at age twenty, where he coached basketball and where he was a principal, and where he taught math and science.  And, subsequently, went to the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] to get a doctorate degree.  He was the first African American to get a doctorate degree at University of Texas.  He got his master's degree at the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], and he ended up becoming a college president at Wiley College where I went to school.  And I never worried about the fact that my dad was president because I figured he'd be pretty even handed.  And he was.  He was the best friend at my wedding.  I just felt I could talk to him, I felt--now that didn't mean that I could--I got away with things.  But I--he was always supportive and always eager to see me excel and do well.
Speaker 1: What did you learn from your daddy, or what characteristics did you--do you think that you've gotten from your father?
Speaker 2: Probably two or three, I'm a workaholic as I implied earlier and that I got from him.  He travelled--worked long hours.  I think his--he didn't have many hobbies although I do, but his whole life was about working and rearing his family.  I have three sisters, two older [Jo Ann Cole and Eva Cole] and one younger [Patricia Cole].  And to him, his priority was taking care of the family, and so whatever that required he was prepared to do that.  He had a, a, extraordinary memory.  I didn't take that from him but he could recite, you know, poems and do poetry and recite things from his childhood that was always--could recite Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] and he could recite poems that he learned in college, James Weldon Johnson.  He was just--he had a phenomenal memory.  He could play the piano and never took a piano lesson.  He eventually became the general president of our fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.] and served there.  And almost everything that he did, he would end up getting to the top virtually effortlessly without really being politically active and that sort of thing.  I, I had a lot of support for the things that he did, and so, he was--always on the go, always, always doing things.
Story_ID: 569875
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about th- any things that might have happened between you and your father [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] personally, you know, just the two--one on one (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there are always stories and I'm not sure that I remember the right ones, but I remember when he was studying for his doctorate at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].  He was working full-time at Wiley College [Marshall, Texas] as a registrar then, and he would go to Austin [Texas] every week on Tuesdays and stay until Thursday and then come back home, so that was the way he was able to still work full-time while he'd go to school.  Sometimes he would take me with him, and I would always look forward to that, particularly, in the summer when I was not in school.  And I would always look forward to that.  I will never forget the time he was taking his German exam and during that period of time when you did your German, there were four or five passages you were asked to translate and he memorized all four passages, and I would sit there and read the English while he would look at the German and translate it.  So I always teased him and told him I helped him get his doctorate degree. You know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did he share stories about him growing up?  How was he able to achieve going to the different, you know, get into the college level when, of course, his parents were not at that level (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he came from a--yeah, he came from parents [Vada Martha Cole and Joseph Cole] who were not very accomplished themselves but he and his brothers and sisters were accomplished.  His older brother [Robert Cole] became a administer, he--there were (unclear) about nine children in his family so there was a large age difference between him and his oldest brother.  So that his oldest brother's children were almost like his brothers and sisters in terms of their ages. But he had this, this tremendous drive, this inner drive that so would help support--helped him decide what he wanted to do.  He was encouraged of course by his, by his parents but I think it was really just a very strong inner drive to succeed, to accomplish.
Story_ID: 569876
Speaker 1: Tell me about your, your siblings, can you tell me their names and where you fit in?
Speaker 2: My oldest sister is--her name is Jo Ann [Jo Ann Cole], she is a retired public school teacher and also an Episcopal priest.  She went to seminary late in life after she had a career in public school teaching and probably ten, maybe fifteen years ago.  She always had the calling, in fact, my dad [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] used to, used to, say that people thought he was gonna be a minister.  He was always close to the church, very active in the church and we all grew up in the church.  My sister, I think, felt the calling more closely and so she ended up going to seminary.  So she's an Episcopal priest now and a retired public school teacher.  My second sister, the one closest to me, was also a public school teacher.  And she has since retired.  And my baby sister was a public school teacher.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Eva [Eva Cole], her name is Eva Marie, yes.  And she has retired and is working part-time here and there but her career was as a public school teacher.  And my youngest sister, her name is Patricia [Patricia Cole] is also a retired public school teacher.  So you can, you can see the thread in--with all of us.  There has been some degree of teaching.  I didn't teach in public schools, I taught at the higher education level always but there has been a connection in education for all of us.
Story_ID: 569877
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about y- you and your earliest memory of your childhood.  Can you remember what your momor- your earliest memory (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think my earliest memory is when I was three years old being on a train, when the family was moving from Vernon [Texas] to Bryan, Texas.  I remember looking out the window and seeing my [maternal] grandmother [Josephine Redmond (ph.)] and waving good-bye.
Story_ID: 569878
Speaker 1: And I think one of the best things my dad [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] could have done for us was to get us out of Vernon, Texas.
Speaker 2: What was going on in Vernon, Texas?
Speaker 1: Well, it was just so small, just not many opportunities there that's all.  It's just--Vernon, Texas is in the panhandle up by El Pas- not El Paso [Texas].  What's that--anyway it's in the Texas panhandle and a very small town.  And just not very many, many opportunities there--near Amarillo [Texas] is what I was trying to think of.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we moved to Bryan [Texas] where he had another assignment as principal, but Bryan was kind of like in the middle of the state.  And closer to Navasota [Texas] where we could visit his side of the family more often.  But there were many more opportunities there than, than in Navasota.
Story_ID: 569879
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that you and your sisters and brothers did during the day, you know, your acti- daily activities once you--right before you started going to school?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, you know, we lived in segregated communities.  I don't remember much about Vernon [Texas] except we would go back to visit during summers and Christmas and that sort of things, but when we grew up in Bryan [Texas], we just--my mother [Eva Sharp] taught school and my father [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] was the principal.  And we were left to ourselves most of the time until we were the age we could go to school.  That's one of the reasons I started school a little early.  I was five years old when I started first grade.  In Texas and most states you have to be six unless you're gonna be six within a couple of months of when school start and my birthday is in January.  And so I got an early start, and one of the reasons I did was because my older sister [Jo Ann Cole] was already in school and it was just tougher leaving me there when she was already, when she was already in school.
Speaker 1: Did you go (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All we did was just played, you know, tree house and the usual (laughter) kinds of things that kids do at that age.
Speaker 1: When you started school, did you go to the school that your father was the principal of?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  He was principal of the elementary school [Washington Elementary School] in Bryan.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: I think it was, you know, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: What year would this be?
Speaker 2: I was five so this would've been 1946.
Speaker 1: Forty-six [1946].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you remember elementary school?
Speaker 2: I don't remember much about that.  I told my mother several times.  I said, you know, I don't remember growing up.  I don't remember any specific experiences that I wanted to talk about it. I had--for no special reason.  I know that I had a very tough first grade.  I had a tough first grade (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, well, let's talk about that.
Speaker 2: I made Ds and Cs and things, but I loved my first grade teacher. Her name was Miss Martinez [ph.] and I'll never forget her, but I just was not a--was, was--I was not giving much attention to the, to the class work.
Speaker 1: Well, do you think it was because you were younger?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it was or not.  Maybe, maybe.  But, you know, in all of the elementary school classes were in one, in one, one building and so the first and second grade were together.  And so I don't, I don't know what--I just remember bring home a report card with some Cs on it and my mother and father being unhappy about that.  And--but I got it together thereafter and I, I always liked school.
Story_ID: 569880
Speaker 1: I always liked my teachers, particularly, the female teachers.  And one in particular I'll never forget, Mrs. Hall [ph.], when I was in the--I think I was in the third grade [at Washington Elementary School, Bryan, Texas].  And sometimes I would go spend weekends and wouldn't wanna come home.
Speaker 2: Oh, you would go to her house?
Speaker 1: Yes, I would go to her house and she--and just--it was a way I think for, for--a kind of babysitting, you know, we all in some way or another would end up giving our parents [Eva Sharp and Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] some time, you know, not having to deal with four, four children all two years apart, so. So.
Speaker 2: The teachers at your school, were they--well, you said Miss Martinez, so she was Hispanic?
Speaker 1: No.  She had a Spanish name but she was, she was African American, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, she was African American.  All your teachers were African American (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All my teachers were African American, right, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so third grade you remember, were three any other teachers in your elementary years that, that you remember?
Speaker 1: Not--yes, well see, after the third grade we moved to Marshall, Texas.  And I had a fifth grade teacher, it was a man, his name was Mr. Edmond [ph.] and he was one of few male teachers but a very extraordinary guy.  And, yeah, he did it all, you know.  He was in charge of the softball team--recess.  You know, he coordinated recess and he did all those kinds of things but I really learned to appreciate playing softball because of him.  I was not very good athletically at that time, I got better over years but I was not very good then.  And he understood that, and he took--sympathized with what I was going through and he really helped me deal with my ineffectiveness as a, as an athlete but, to put it in perspective, and so he would play me even though he knew I'd drop the ball.  But it was good to have him and I remember him very well.  Then after that, particularly in the seventh and eighth grade, when I was in elementary school we went all the way through the eighth grade and the seventh grade teacher concentrated in math. The eighth grade teacher concentrated in English and so we would switch, spend a half a day with one teacher and half a day with the other teacher.  And I think that's really where I, I sort of found myself and knew that, you know, I wanted to--I didn't mind studying, I enjoyed studying, I enjoyed reading, I enjoyed doing math.  And I think that was kind of where I got the interest in doing math was from my seventh grade teacher.
Speaker 2: And do you remember her name, or was--it was a her?
Speaker 1: My eighth grade teacher name, Mrs. Williams [ph.].  What was--it'll come to me.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 1: I can see her now, I can see her face right now but I just can't think of her name right now.
Speaker 2: Okay. All right, we're gonna stop here--
Speaker 1: Miss Vance [ph.].
Story_ID: 569881
Speaker 1: I know there must have been instances in which he had run-ins with the superintendent and with the school board about that. But I think his, his, his, he was sent there and I think the reason he went there was that he not only was a role model for his children but also for the other kids who were, who were, who were in school and was concentrating on, on making sure they excelled.
Speaker 2: Do we have speed?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You have speed.
Speaker 2: I wanted to go back and just talk about that again because we were talking about it off-camera, but I think it's important that we talk about that.  I asked you, when your father [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] was principal, did he try to do anything about the conditions of the schools because most of (cough) excuse me--most of the, the black schools would get books from the white schools, you know, after they're done with them.  And you said that your father really didn't talk about it but what do you think the feeling might have been?
Speaker 1: Oh, I think he probably did much more than he was willing to share with us about it.  He was very, how should I say, intent on making the best of bad situations.  If it were situations that were not likely to lead to any useful results, he probably would not have done it.  He was not a, a outwardly aggressive, very pushy when it comes to trying to impact on, on civil rights.  He did most of his work behind the scenes.  His writings, his speeches, his, his own contacts and relationships where I think he was able to affect much more behind the scenes than being an, an advocate that was in the public arena.  But I do know that he probably, probably understood what the ramifications would've been had he been more vocal.  And, I think at that time, you know, school board wouldn't have hesitated to remove you if you were too, too outspoken.
Story_ID: 569882
Speaker 1: Now we're in 1954
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you're getting ready to go to high school [H.B. Pemberton High School, Marshall, Texas] and, of course, the Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]--
Speaker 2: I remember the day that decision came down.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell me about that?
Speaker 2: I was in, I was in elementary school and I remember the principal just walking it up and down the halls talking about that--I did not, at the time, know the ramifications until he said it.  And it was just--he was making such a big deal out of the importance of that decision.  Obviously, it did not have an immediate impact because I was in a segregated school then and went to high school in a segregated--
Story_ID: 569883
Speaker 1: I'd picked up playing the clarinet when I was in that elementary school and back in those days the band director from the high school [H.B. Pemberton High School, Marshall, Texas] band would go to the, to the elementary school to try to get students interested in playing instruments.  And I think he was doing it both because it meant they would to get an early start so when they came to high school, they'd be able to join his band.  But, I was--he was surprised at how well I played, so he invited me as a--in the seventh grade to play with the high school band.  So I was--that was a--they didn't have a uniform small enough for me, which--so my mother [Eva Sharp] being the seamstress that she is, was able to adjust one of those large band uniforms.  And so, I was at that time, very short.  My parents thought I was gonna be more like my Uncle Willie [ph.] 'cause I was, I was 5'2" at that time.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: And I did most of my growing in high school but that's another story.
Story_ID: 569884
Speaker 1: Now you go to high school.  Do you--what's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I go to high school, go to H.B. Pemberton High School [Marshall, Texas].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what's the name again?
Speaker 2: Pemberton.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that, please?
Speaker 2: P-E-M-B-E-R-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and tell me what kind of student you were in high school?
Speaker 2: I was an excellent student.  I made all As maybe one--a B or so here or there, I got a B in history.  But most of my other grades were As, I graduated valedictorian.  I was in the college band, I was president of student government association.  You name it, I did it.  I--except athletically, I did do it.  I really wanted to play basketball 'cause I was growing now and I was getting taller.  And I'll never forget as a senior, I went to go out for the basketball team and the coach told me that he would--he wouldn't think it was a good idea because number one, I was too late in my, in my high school years then that he wouldn't be able to spend much time working with me. And so I ended up--as my biggest disappointment in high school was that I could not play basketball.  But on the academic side and on the music side, and drama and all the other kinds of things, I was, I was always very good at that.
Speaker 1: And what about the drama?  What, were you in plays in school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was in plays both my junior and senior year.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what plays they were?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had the lead role in, in the play in my junior year and I played--I was--at that time I was set on being a musician.  I had developed a, a I think a fairly well-known ability with the clarinet.  I mean, I played all over the state, all over the region and I was pretty good, if I can say so myself.  And I thought that was gonna be my future.  And so I was all set to pursue a career in music until I took chemistry as a senior, and I enjoyed it so much and I was good at that too.  My teacher called me one Saturday, he said, "You made a hundred on the final exam, and I really hope you'll think about majoring in chemistry in, in college."  And so I sort of, like that, decided to switch to chemistry.  Also, though, my father [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] had a college roommate who was a chemist and a very good one.  And you may have heard the name in your other interviews, his name was Henry McBay [Henry C. McBay].  He ended up probably producing more African American Ph.D.'s than any other single individual.  He was on the faculty at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] for many, many years.  But he and my dad were college roommates and when my dad told him about my interest in chemistry, he jumped all over it and suggested I pursue that.  And I ended up going to the same university he went to, to get my doctorate.  And so, I continued the music, I even had a senior recital when I was in college but I gave less, less emphasis and less attention to it and focused more on, on, on science.

Speaker 1: So what other activities in high school [H.B. Pemberton High School, Marshall, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Boy Scouts.  I was a very active Boy Scouter.  I ended up becoming a Eagle Scout.  And in a little town like Marshall, Texas, you know, you get in trouble if you don't find something, some things to do and so Boy Scouts gave me a very wholesome outlet and at the same time I learned a lot.  I think I probably learned most of my early leadership skills being in the Boy Scouts.
Speaker 1: What year--how old were you when you started in the Boy Scouts?
Speaker 2: I started at age eleven.
Speaker 1: At eleven, okay.
Speaker 2: But, when I became a patrol leader and senior patrol leader, I ended up going to the jamboree, and--
Speaker 1: Well, what were the jamborees like?
Speaker 2: It was an extraordinary experience.  It was the first time I really had gotten away from home and it was--we had joined a group of other Boy Scouts from East Texas.  They was still a predominantly black group, not all black, I mean, group out of East Texas, and we went to--the jamboree was in Valley Forge [Pennsylvania] and we went to, to Washington, D.C. and spent a day or so there, and walked around the Washington monuments.  First time I'd really had a chance to do that, went to the jamboree and had a chance there to become exposed to Boy Scouts from all over the world really.  It was, it was interesting that I met Boy Scouts there, white Boy Scouts from my hometown and we were great friends except when we went back home (laughter).
Story_ID: 569886
Speaker 1: When do you think was your, your first time that you experienced prejudice or racism?
Speaker 2: It, it was in--it, it didn't--doesn't take--it take you long to realize things were different for a black child in Marshall, Texas.  We would, you know, the colored water signs and the, the white water signs were everywhere.  If you go to the, to the apparel stores, you couldn't try on things there.  I'll never forget seeing them put tissue paper in hats when you wanted to try those on, particularly, for women who had, you know, grease on their hair.  They would protect the apparel.  And, of course, the movie theaters were, were segregated and we would go upstairs and sit in what is, you know, what we called a buzzard's roost to--we did it resenting it while we were doing it.  But the other options were, were limited.  And so, I'd say that growing up in a segregated town like Marshall, you feel the subtle indignities--you couldn't go swimming in the local swimming pool.  And so, I learned how to swim in a lake that the scout master discovered and got permission for us to use it, and that's, that where I learned how, learned how to swim.  And then when we tried to integrate the local swimming pool, then they closed it.
Story_ID: 569887
Speaker 1: You at one time when you were in junior high school or middle school, I guess elementary school--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we went straight from elementary to high school [H.B. Pemberton High School, Marshall, Texas], yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You went from high school. In elementary school math was a big thing and now you're turning towards the chemistry but the math of course helped you there.  So, at this point before you're getting ready to graduate, was there any teachers at your school that influenced you and helped you get to the point or make the decision of what college you would go to or did you just know that you were going to Wiley [Wiley College, Marshall, Texas]--
Speaker 2: Well, it's an interesting story, it's an interesting story.  I, I took the SAT as a junior and I did so well that colleges started recruiting me as a junior.  Actually, I took it as a sophomore and, and they started--and when the results were in, started recruiting me as a junior.  And I toyed with the idea of, of missing my senior year and starting college early because I'd gotten some attractive offers to get--have scholarships to, to go to college.  And then I decided against that and I'm not sure why all the reasons why, I think for childish reasons more than anything else, you know, I'd miss my friends, I was elected president of SGA [student government association] and I wanted to, I wanted to at least serve out that year, you know, I was--I didn't have a girlfriend at that time that I was particularly, you know, concerned, except that next year I met my soon to be wife [HistoryMaker Brenda H. Cole] who was at another school but that's, that wouldn't have impacted on my decision to go to college.  I then, as I was thinking about going to college, my older sister [Jo Ann Cole] was in college and she decided to come to attend Wiley.  And I knew my dad [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] who was president at Wiley at the time was going all over the state recruiting students, and I just said, you know, how's it look if his own children go somewhere else.  And Wiley College is a very good school and had a good reputation in science.  And so, given the relationship my dad had with his former roommate [Henry C. McBay], they said, very well, why don't you go to Wiley.  I, I had a scholarship, Wiley gave high school valedictorians tuition scholarships and so independent of my dad's connection, I had a tuition scholarship.  And I lived at home and so I said, it'll be, it'll be cheaper for my parents.  And then once I finish college, I can go to graduate school somewhere else.  And so that's kind of how I ended up at Wiley.  And the band director at Wiley College taught me music lessons on the side.  Every other Saturday I would go and he would, he would help me.  And so, you know, he was--he told me that--basically reinforced the decision and so he named me the drum major as a freshman.  And so, I had a good time, I had a ball in college.  I did, I mean, I did, I lived at home but I, you know, I had to go the full range of things to do at the college.  I had--I took like twenty-two, twenty-four hours and finished college in three years.
Story_ID: 569888
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so you graduated from high school [H.B. Pemberton High School, Marshall, Texas] in--
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, when did you pledge?
Speaker 2: I pledged in the spring of 1959.
Speaker 1: Oh, so it was after you graduated from Wiley [Wiley College, Marshall, Texas]?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: I thought you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I graduated from Wiley in 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry. I got the dates mixed up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated from high school in 1958.
Speaker 1: Okay, '58 [1958].  Okay, so tell me why did you decide to pledge?
Speaker 2: There was no question. (Laughter) You know how sometimes you grow up just knowing there's certain things you're gonna do and you don't even think about it too much.  My dad [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] was an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  He was a very active in the Alpha Fraternity, he was regional vice president I believe at the time.  And I, I knew a lot of Alphas, lot of the leaders on campus were Alphas.  And so that was just no, no--not much thinking about it.  So at the earliest opportunity, which was after I had, you know, it was based on the number of hours--I was, I was technically a sophomore.  I went to summer school and then first semester and I had enough hours to be a sophomore so, technically, I was a sophomore.  And so that was early enough to, to pledge.
Story_ID: 569889
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about other activities on the Wiley campus [Wiley College, Marshall, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I did everything.
Speaker 1: Like what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, I was, as I said, I was drum major of the band.  I was in all, all the academic organizations. I--
Speaker 1: Well what were some of the--
Speaker 2: I was a lab instructor in, in chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, you said all of the academic--
Speaker 2: But I did not, I did not, I did not become president of student government, my only disappointment in college.  And, let me tell you why, or one of the reasons why.  When I was a junior, that was the beginning of sit-ins and student unrest all over the country.  And Wiley College was no different.  There was a group of students, good friends of mine who were very active in demonstrating against segregation at restaurants and theaters and places downtown.  And that was about the same time when, as an aspiring senior, I was running for SGA [student government association] president.  And when on many campuses the students and the president--students on campus and the president of the college were at odds, at strategies, at consequences of students demonstrating and particularly in some of the southern universities.  Students were kicked out of school and--at many places.  And so there was this what was assumed to be a natural disconnect, or natural dissension between the leadership of the college and the students.  And so, that's one of the reasons students didn't vote for me, because they figured I would not be as supportive of them as compared to my father [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.].  And so, I was one of the candidates, I came in second but I did not end up being elected president of student government association.
Speaker 1: And you said that was a disappointment to you. Do you feel that you--which side would you have taken?  I mean, would you have tried to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know, I don't know.  I think I would have tried to be understanding.  I think I would've been a good broker, that's what I've done most of my life.  I have--you know, I do take sides on certain issues but I have always been a good mediator.  And so where there are issues, contentious issues and both sides have points, you know, somebody need, needs to kind of help broker that.  And I've been--I've done a lot of that since then.  I think that's probably why I would've ended--that wouldn't of been good enough for the students though (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you participate in any of the sit-ins and demonstrations with the students?
Speaker 2: I did but not many.  I did participate but I was not one of the leaders.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you participate in?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Demonstrations and marches.
Speaker 1: Were they at the school, downtown?
Speaker 2: No, downtown.
Speaker 1: Downtown at the lunch counters or movie theaters?
Speaker 2: No, just--I didn't, I didn't sit down at the lunch counters and I didn't, I didn't--but I did participate in the marches from the campus to the downtown and then back, and the singing and demonstrations and that way.  There were, there were many students who were much more aggressive than, than I.
Story_ID: 569890
Speaker 1: You also said that you met your wife on the campus [of Wiley College, Marshall, Texas]?
Speaker 2: No, I met my wife in high school [H.B. Pemberton High School, Marshall, Texas].
Speaker 1: Oh, you met her in high school?
Speaker 2: I met my wife in high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: It's an interesting story. In our day the teachers from East Texas, which is that part of Texas I grew up in and Marshall [Texas] is in, would meet for the annual conference of black teachers.  And one of the highlights of the meeting would be an all-star band. And they would invite band members from all of the high schools, and two from this school, three from this, and four from this and then they would, there would be a special director either from one of the colleges who would come in and direct us into performing during the last evening of the, of their conference.  And so, my wife played clarinet as well, and so at that time, that's where I met.  She and I sat next to each other and so what was a relationship that started out in high school just developed over time.  She was two years behind me and so every, every, Easter break when we would meet, I would look forward to that 'cause I'd get a chance to see her.  But that's how we met, she lived in a different city and so--and she went to a different college, but we maintained connections and eventually, eventually married in 1964.
Speaker 1: What is your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Brenda [HistoryMaker Brenda H. Cole].
Speaker 1: And what school did she go to?
Speaker 2: She went to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 569891
Speaker 1: All right, so now you graduate summa cum laude?
Speaker 2: Graduate--yeah, I graduate from, from--summa cum laude and, you know, books were easy to me and I just thought I knew--I was the last word.  I got a scholarship to go to University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], this is summer of 1961.  And I--was I in for a rude awakening.  I just--my study habits were all bad.  I was used to the idea of studying couple of nights before the final exams and going in and acing the exam.  But when I got to the University of Texas, I just--I was lost.  And I really, really struggled that summer.  And I knew I wanted to leave because not only was it tough going but it was a racist institution.  There was only one dormitory where black kids could live and it was, it was Austin, Texas in 1961 and very much, very racist.  I didn't want to stay there, and I had been convinced by my--Dr. McBay [Henry C. McBay], my dad's [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] former roommate, to go the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  So, I, I was already planning to go there after the summer and indeed went there in the summer--in September 1961.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about some of your experiences at the University of Texas.  Is this where you had the Southern Regional Fellowship?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly right, that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Tell me about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were very few, there were very few black students there.  There were three other black students that had Southern Regional Fellows and we just kind of bonded because there were no others, frankly, that we, that we could connect to.  There were a couple of other black students in the chemistry department who I came to know and who became good supporters, and they encouraged, they encouraged me but there was nobody to study with.  And the teachers were rather--worse than ambivalent, I mean, they just--they didn't encourage you to come talk to them after class, and I was just struggling.  You know, I just was not used to the kind of lecturing and the kind of teaching that they had.  I, I had a car and hardly ever used it (laughter) because I spent most of my time in the library and in the laboratory.  And even with that, I had a very difficult time at the University of Texas. I just, you know, sometimes your environments encourage you, encourage your best work and sometimes they don't.  And the University of Texas was one of those environments that just simply did not seem to be a good fit for me.  When I went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], I had a Woodrow Wilson Fellow [Woodrow Wilson Fellowship] and the first fellowship--and the first thing that the secretary of the department told me when I got there is that, the value of your--this fellowship is not as high as teaching assistantships and so we were all granted so that it will be equivalent to what you would have received had you gotten a teaching assistantship.  And so, already, you know, I felt better about, about being there.  And it was tough, it was--the first year was very difficult.  And I didn't have many friends and not a whole lot of folks to, to study with.  And some of the smartest people I ever seen, you know.  And here I was thinking that I was gonna set the curve and I was gonna be the big BMOC [big man on campus] like in college [Wiley College, Marshall, Texas], and that was not the case at all.  I finally got in the groove of things and, you know, picked up on how you best study and how you perform well on exams.
Story_ID: 569892
Speaker 1: Probably the best thing that happened to me in graduate school was that I got a research advisor that had an exciting research project. And I was very, and I was very good in the lab.  I could manipulate things and do glass blowing and things like that really well so he put me on this project (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who was your teacher?
Speaker 1: --called the synthesis of cubane.
Speaker 2: Who was your teacher?
Speaker 1: His name was Eaton, Philip Eaton [Philip E. Eaton].  He was a young guy, he was only about four years older than I.  He was--he had just come to the university and he was eager to get tenure.  I was his first graduate student.  And so I had no problems with working long hours.  And so I usually worked, you know, eighteen, twenty hours a day Saturdays and Sundays included.  It was fun, I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed work, doing laboratory work.  And we were fortunate that we were very successful, we did something that the others said it couldn't be done.
Speaker 2: Well, tell me about the project. It was called--
Speaker 1: It was called synthesis of a cubane.  It's a compound in which it's composed of eight carbon atoms that are attached together like a cube.  You've seen a--you draw four squares and connect them?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Well imagine at the intersect of each one of those squares is a carbon and a hydrogen, and a hydrogen.  And so, in chemistry compounds that are made of carbon and hydrogen have the suffix -ane and so this shape--was shaped like a cube and therefore it was called cubane.  And when we, when, when we worked through the synthesis of that compound then immediately I became famous.  He, more so, because he was a major advisor.  But there were a couple of research papers presented by Eaton and Cole [HistoryMaker Thomas W. Cole] and anywhere I would go in the country, if I would identify myself as that Cole, I was famous.  So I was, I was very--it was a, you know, it was serendipitous.  It didn't have to happen that way but it did.  And I was very pleased overall with the decision to go the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] because of that outcome.
Story_ID: 569893
Speaker 1: Talking about your studies with, with Dr. Eaton [Philip E. Eaton], tell me why this was such a breakthrough.  What was the significance of what you all discovered?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the, the, the backbone of organic chemistry is carbon and in various configurations, and various attachments but the natural state of carbon bonded compounds is to be formed at certain angles between carbon and the other atoms to which it is attached.  And that standard angle is tetrahedral. 109.5 degrees, okay.  But if you can imagine a box or a square that angle is 90 degrees and so when you bend the bond angles to where from 105 degrees to 90 degrees, that's a major change.  And so, the theoretical chemists said you can't do that, you can't bend them down that far and attach them in a form of a box.  And my advisor says, well, if you are clever enough, you can come up with some reactions that can force you to do that. And he turned out to be correct.  And it was at a time--and synthetic organic chemistry when there was a lot of interest in what is called strained compounds, compounds where you bend the angles as far as you can and see if it will generate a compound that's stable.  It turned out cubane was extraordinarily stable.  And he got tenure (laughter) I think in part because he was successful and did some extraordinary other chemistry with it and I, I sort of joined his coattail and got a little, a little of that, of that fame as well because everywhere I went and told them that I worked on cubane, I was already a celebrity.  And the fact that I was black made it that even more attractive to people.  Did that help?  Did that make any sense?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it did.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Did that have specific immediate practical applications?
Speaker 1: Not immediate practical applications but it does have applications on which chemists are still working.  One is looking for some, with the right attachments, whether it has pharmaceutical applications or antiviral applications.  And it's still very much part of what is here forty years later, around the world there are laboratories in Italy and there are also laboratories that are using it for explosives because if you hit right then it, it detonates so there are those kinds of applications.  Probably not inexpensive, but at least part of the total mosaic of chemistry that you--that contributes to the total knowledge that would have a little bit of here and a little bit of there, and a little bit of there then you can put together some things that make even better sense and have a more practical value, yeah.  But I, I mean I worked with it for four--no, for two years in graduate school [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and then when I took my first professorship, I continued some of that work at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  So, it was really--I was really fortunate.  I was really very fortunate to be able to be assigned to that project.  It was really a case where my interest and my skills and my willingness to work long hours paid off.  He turned out to be a very good major professor, had my interests at heart and really wanted to see me continue to do well.  And we had a very good, very good professional relationship while I was his, his student, and as I say, I was his first student so that meant he leaned on me and sat on me and pushed me harder than he did some of his other students because he didn't have anybody else, you know (laughter).  And I was crazy.  He would, he would, I mean in terms of work hours, I was in the lab from usually I'd get there around noon and I'd stay to 2:00 in the morning.  Working, working constantly.
Story_ID: 569894
Speaker 1: During this time, right before this time, the, the country is in a state of--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) turmoil when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] is assassinated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where were you at that time?
Speaker 2: I'll never forget it.  I, you know, I didn't--I was walking into my laboratory and my colleagues were gathered around and--just talking--and I didn't have a, a habit of turning on the radio in my car at the time when I drove in.  And I went to them to find what, what they were talking about and that's when they, they said, "The president's been shot."  I said, "You're kidding, the president of what country?"  Not the U.S., you know.  "What Latin American country has this happened in?"  And so, obviously, we didn't do any work that day.  We stayed--we talked all day, all day about that and--
Speaker 1: What were some of the conversations that were going on (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was disbelief, it was just shock, you know, I mean nobody would just have expected that to happen in this country.  And then, of course, I'm from Texas and so the fact that Johnson [Lyndon Baines Johnson] was gonna be the next president--at that time I had ambivalent feelings about Johnson, you know, Johnson didn't have a good reputation to African Americans in Texas.  Turned out to be much different when he became president, but you know, we weren't sure what kind of president he was gonna make, so we talked about that and--but it was just, just stunned, you know.  We couldn't, we--nobody could feel that they could continue business as usual.  Clearly, it was an indication--and then conspiracy theories and all of that, you know, played into our conversation as well.  And so, I suspect we spent the rest of the afternoon just gathered around talking about how, how, how horrible it was.
Story_ID: 569895
Speaker 1: When you left the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], what, what was next?
Speaker 2: I came to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] as a, as an assistant professor of chemistry.  I was torn between the idea of going into industry, as I indicated earlier, I was, I was a fairly good technician and the word got out.  And so there were lot of companies that were willing to give me positions.  Still, this is 1966 so there's not a whole lot of African Americans being hired in chemical industry.  That's right there always were some dating back in the years but I could almost name my ticket.  And my research advisor wanted me to go on to do a post-doc.  See, the trend was to do a post doctorate and after that then you aspire to become a professor at a major university.  And so, I was toying with the idea of doing that or going to work in a industry where the salaries--I had a nice fourteen thousand dollars a year offer to go to industry and just, I just, just didn't quite make that connection.  My dad [Thomas W. Cole, Sr.] was, was trying to encourage me to come back to Wiley [Wiley College, Marshall, Texas] to help him build a science program there, and my, my discomfort with that was that Wiley was a small undergraduate college.  And I had gotten into the research thing now, and so I wanted to go somewhere, where I could do research but I wanted to impact on the training of African Americans.  So that limited my options, and I applied to Atlanta University, to Howard University [Washington D.C.], to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and Lincoln University.  And Howard and Atlanta University both responded, made offers, and I elected Atlanta University not only because it gave me the chance to, to research but also Henry McBay [Henry C. McBay] was there at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and I was able to resume a relationship with him (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Relationship. Um-hm. Who, who, who was the president of Atlanta University at that time?
Speaker 2: Rufus Clement [Rufus Early Clement] was the president at the time.
Speaker 1: And, who was over at the--so this--you were--who was over the chemistry department?
Speaker 2: A guy by the name of Kimuel Huggins.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how, how was it--did the (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was, it was a two-person department when I came.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I made three, and there were five students.  And I saw this as a real opportunity to build something, to make a difference.  And in the time that I--from 1966, I eventually became chairman of the department and it grew to eight faculty and sixty students in a period of about less than ten years.  And most of that was because we were able to get money, not from the university 'cause it was not a wealthy university, but from the industry.  So we--that, that built a connection between the chemistry department and, and our friends in the industrial community 'cause they wanted to get African American graduates that they could hire.  And so, it was a good, it was a good relationship, good connection.
Story_ID: 569896
Speaker 1: In 1967, (cough) that summer you were a research assistant for Procter and Gamble [Procter and Gamble Company, Cincinnati, Ohio] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Well I, I thought I wanted to try industry, see how I'd get along, see how I would do.  And I got the very nice offer to go to Procter and Gamble in Cincinnati [Ohio] and absolutely loved it, almost stayed.  I really did, I almost stayed.
Speaker 1: Said almost.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because not only was I, was I enjoying the work and not just only dealing with perfumes and things like that, but I was the star of their softball team.  I mean, see, my, my athletic abilities matured over time as I got older and so I was the star of the softball team.  So it was, it was--I had a great time.  And I almost stayed.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) What kind of research did you do there?
Speaker 2: Again, it was a continuation of what I had done in graduate school [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], working on what was called very unusual structures and it was in connection with synthesizing compounds that might eventually be good perfumes, or that could--because that was part of some of what Procter and Gamble was, was working on.  But I was in a separate, separate group just working on what was called nondre- non-applied chemistry.  It wasn't applied to the soaps or anything like that.  They just had a research group that was doing their own thing.  And that's where they put me in.  I was, I was having a good time.
Speaker 1: How was it working with your colleagues?  How many blacks were also working?
Speaker 2: There were two blacks.  There was one other black there on the staff.  But, you know, that never presented a problem for me. In graduate school, all the students were white except for a couple.  And so, before too long, you know, it was, it was a non-issue for me.  And so at Procter and Gamble the same is true.  But what was so glaring is that there was so few blacks, which then reinforced why I thought I was doing the right thing by being at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] to help increase the number who would be attractive--attracted to and, and to industry in a way that we wanted to flood the market because there were so few.
Speaker 1: So that was one of the main reasons why you went back?
Speaker 2: That's one of the main reasons I went back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 569897
Speaker 1: Tell me what happens at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] now.  You're a Callaway Professor [Fuller E. Callaway Professor] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I became a Callaway Professor.  Thomas Jarrett [Thomas D. Jarrett] became the president, he was the dean of the School of Arts and Sciences who hired me.  And he himself was a University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] graduate and we developed a good, a good working relationship and in the late 1960s, Fuller E. Callaway made available in order to improve the salaries for distinguished faculty one chair at every four-year school in the State of Georgia.  So, Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] got two, University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] got two and the biggest schools got more than one, but every year the four-year schools got at least one.  And the president named me.  Now, he did it I think for--I can't put words in his mouth.  I always thought he did it for two reasons, one was he knew I was struggling financially and it was one way--it increased my salary by 50 percent.  All of my fourteen thousand dollars a year, you know, at the time it increased it to twenty-one.  But, but he had confidence in me I think in ways that I did not appreciate when he did it.  I became the youngest chair professor in the country, I was only twenty-eight at the time.  And so I felt more of an obligation to stay because of the commitment that the administration had, had placed in me.  And so, it was a, it was a way--it meant that money was no longer the issue to keep me or to attract me away from the university.
Speaker 1: So what type of--are you doing research here at the university?
Speaker 2: I was doing research, doing research, continuing to research on cubane.  I had graduate students who were doing the research.  I was giving lectures and papers all over the country, I was going to, you know, the chemical society meetings and things like that.  And I was really finding my niche, if you will. Doing research, teaching, broadening my exposure to the scientists and chemists, you know, at other universities.  And then I became chairman of the department, and that gave me additional administrative responsibilities that were not problematic but it meant I couldn't do as much research.  But it did give me the capacity to speak for the university, to speak for the department.  And it just grew like crazy, you know, it was a good time because, as I alluded to earlier, the chemical industry was looking to get more blacks to go there.  And so they would come visit and I would convince them that, you know, it was quid pro quo.  The stronger we make the department, the better educated the students will be when they come to you.  And we produced a lot of graduates who ended up working for the chemical industry.  Some, even now, I, I, I hear from.
Story_ID: 569898
Speaker 1: Who are some of those students that are--were successful in (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Our students that went to, went to DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company], students that went to Allied Chemical [Allied Chemical Corporation], that went to Upjohn's [Upjohn Company], students went to Eli Lilly [Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Indiana].  I mean, they went to--and, and they've done very well.  Three or four of them went on to get doctorate degrees, which is what the combination of the two was really what we been trying to do.  Many of the students came from the same environment I came from, small liberal arts, black schools [HBCUs].  And so that their exposure to chemistry was not as strong as it may have been if they had gone to a larger more prestigious school.  And so, what we did was we bridged the gap between where they were when they came and where they should've been when they, when they--so they were ready when they graduated.  But sometimes they needed a little extra push or extra support, and extra resource.  And, as I said, the department had grown to sixty students when I was, when I was chairman.  It was also a good time to be working in Atlanta [Georgia] and Atlanta universities because, as you know, the Center [Atlanta University Center; Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta Georgia] is composed of six schools and we were all working together like we were all in the same department.  It was esprit de corps and a camaraderie that really made it nice to be a part of the team of people.  And so that you were exposed to faculty who were not at the institution where you were, but who were a part of the larger Atlanta University Center.
Story_ID: 569899
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, now in the '60s [1960s], how--did--were you notified about the draft?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I missed it, I almost got caught during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  I was all set to go, I was gonna go but that was the time of fairly easy student deferments.  And so I was able to get student deferments all the way through, through graduate school, but I was prepared to have to go during the missile crisis.  I was in the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] at the time and we just knew, we just figured that, that was gonna escalate.  But then once we got passed that, I continued getting student deferments.  And then when I accepted the position at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], the president of the university wrote to my draft board and said that, he's teaching, and so you could then--student deferments were easier to get but then if you were teaching, you could get deferments.  So I got a deferment until age thirty-five, and so by that time I was too old.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did not end up going to the [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 1: Did you have friends that went to Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: You have any stories about any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In fact, I came from--no, no, I came from a, a, you know, a town Marshall, Texas where there were not that many options.  And many of my classmates ended up being drafted.  It was a little bit before Vietnam, so I knew more who had gone to Korea than, than Vietnam.  I got to know them later, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 569900
Speaker 1: And now, you're at Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] and when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is killed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes and I, I remember where I was that night.  I was at--a friend of mine and I had gone to the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] to serve as judges for a high school science fair, and we were driving back to Atlanta [Georgia] with the radio on and that's how we heard it.  And, obviously, just, you know, just absolutely devastated by that.  But what's interesting about that is that, if you can call anything interesting, was that there was not as much burning and looting, and, and outward reaction in Atlanta as it was in Washington, D.C. and Detroit [Michigan], and other places.  And I think, you know, it's hard to, hard to have a good handle for that except that the people here had a much better, different perspective on it.  Atlanta has always been different, some good some bad.  But I think the fact that he lived here, you know, a prophet is without honor in his own town, in his own country.  And I think it was really after his death, after his assassination that people in Atlanta really came to appreciate what an extraordinary personality this guy was.
Speaker 1: Had--did you have any personal dealings with him?
Speaker 2: I had never met him, I'd seen him, had gone to his church but I had a front row seat at his funeral, because he--his funeral was on the quadrangle in front of the main administration building at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and my office was on the third floor on that corner.  And so I had a front row seat and so I saw all the Kennedys when they came and all the celebrities when they came.  That's how I got to know Maynard Jackson because he was looking around for somewhere, somewhere to sit and it was so crowded that there was nowhere to go and we were just in the building right next door.  And, I know that changed his life and I think it changed, it changed--it just reinforced why I was doing what I was doing.  I just felt that, you know, it could've been easier for me as an individual to make a lot of money working in industry but I thought what I was doing was the right thing.
Speaker 1: So, was that the day that you met Maynard Jackson when you were talking about the funeral?
Speaker 2: It was the day I met him, yes.
Speaker 1: So he came and sat with you?
Speaker 2: Well, see, we kind of had a--our building was locked.  All the adjacent buildings were locked but I had a key to the building where I worked and so, and so we only let our friends in to, to observe from, from the building. And he was, he was walking around and another person in my office saw him, recognized him, and yelled at him and said, "Hey, why don't you come on, we'll let you in."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's how, that's how I got to know him.
Story_ID: 569901
Speaker 1: Tell me what, what happens after that? You know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well things really started moving after that.  I, I mean, I knew in order to build the department of significance was very expensive, and the only way we could get the kind of money to do that was from the federal government.  So, about that time, the federal government began to open up to black colleges [HBCUs] and so we became very active in writing proposals to the federal government.  I was successful along with a group of colleagues in getting a $3 million grant to reinforce what we were doing.  Increased in our minorities, they were calling us then and person from low income to go into careers in science and math.  And so we created a center that focused on that from grade school to graduate school, so we had a relationship with the Atlanta Public Schools where we had a Saturday academy and we had kids coming in on Saturday.  We actually pioneered the idea of Saturday academies that has now popped up all over the country.  We'd bring them at nine o'clock and we'd treat them to math and to science, and communication skills.  Really, English but we called creative expression, right.  And, we were doing a hundred kids a session, and we never had any problems with them.  I mean, no discipline problems, they'd--and during cartoon time they'd be there doing, doing science stuff, you know.  Really an exciting, exciting time.  And then, after that I became--I was appointed provost of the university [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 569902
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, let me ask you about the research that you did.  It--was it Clenese [sic.] or C-
Speaker 2: Eaton [Philip E. Eaton]? Was it?
Speaker 1: No, C-E-L-A-N-E-S-E Fibers Company [Celanese Fibers Company]?
Speaker 2: Oh, Celanese, yes.
Speaker 1: Celanese, okay.
Speaker 2: Celanese, yes. I worked with Celanese for one summer.  I did a sabbatical at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in 1973 and 1974.  It's interesting, I met an extraordinary colleague, he was actually coming to Atlanta [Georgia] to recruit students and then as we talked, it became a good idea that if I spent a year at MIT, I'd have a much better sense of what they do at MIT, what--how difficult or easy or how challenging it will be for our students.  And so, he arranged for me to get an appointment at MIT as a visiting professor.
Speaker 1: Who was this?
Speaker 2: I was afraid you were gonna ask me his name.  I'm embarrassed, I can't think of it but anyway (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You can probably think of it later.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but he convinced me to spend a year there.  And I went there, and it was one of the most, most exhilarating experiences I've ever had.  Talk about bright people, talk about exciting things going on, talk about fear because they were, they were so gifted.  I taught a class and I would spend hours preparing for a one-hour lecture because I didn't want them to catch me.  You know, I wanted to be ready for them, and they taught me something, they taught me a lot and one of the things that they did at MIT is that they would express their appreciation for your lecture by applause.  So you could get immediate feedback about how well you did.  And I would teach for those applauses.  If it were lesser than--then I knew I had to work harder the next time, and so, it was a, it was a good experience.  But I taught a course, continued some research working with a colleague there and got a sense of what it's like in the big leagues at a major, at a major research-oriented university.
Speaker 1: What did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I knew I didn't wanna stay there on a permanent basis, but it was, it was excellent exposure.
Story_ID: 569903
Speaker 1: What did this company do?
Speaker 2: Well, Celanese [Celanese Fibers Company] now, I went to Celanese after I left MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, it's a f-, it was a fibers company, make, make nylon and, and ceramics and, and materials and stuff.  But I was working on a project called Cytrel, it was synthetic tobacco.  And, it was, it was--I was smoking, using a smoke machine, synthetic cigarettes to determine the quantities of, of organic compounds that were in the smoke.  You know, and the idea was that if you could do a synthetic tobacco that had less tar and nicotine, it would be healthier for you.  And so, it didn't, it didn't work out that way because it was very hard to get a market for that in North Carolina.  It was in North Carolina.  So, but it was a good, it was good exposure there as well and I had an ongoing relationship with Celanese.
Speaker 1: What year were you at MIT, was that in '74 [1974], '73 [1973], '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-three [1973], '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you went to Celanese?
Speaker 2: I went to Celanese in the summer of '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But some of this too was also just to make me better able to communicate with students about what life was like at an industry like Celanese.
Story_ID: 569904
Speaker 1: We're just gonna step back a little bit because I, I wanted you to talk about the summer of 1971 as a visiting professor at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well--the Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], the collection of schools, had a very good reputation in producing good graduates, and the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s] became a time when the major universities in this country wanted good students.  And so, they often came to Atlanta [Georgia] to recruit and we would encourage them because they were exposing our students to teachers and scientists and researchers that they may not otherwise meet.  And so, I came to know a lot of colleagues who I may not have otherwise have met.  And, at that time, the pay scale in spite of the fact that I was a college professor was nowhere close to what my colleagues at major universities were, were getting, and so looking for summer employment or taking advantage of summer opportunities was, was financially advantageous but it also broadened your exposure.  And so in 1971, I accepted an invitation to go to University of Illinois to continue research and, but to teach.  And still I'm trying to get a feel for what it's like being in a large environment, you know, teaching, teaching--probably 95 percent of the students then were white students.  And it's no different, I mean, good students are good students, bad students are bad students no matter what color.  And I had, I had an enjoyable time in the University of Illinois except that it was just so hot.
Speaker 1: It was hot?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was hot.  At that time, it, you know, that was kind of pre-air conditioning days, you know.  I was able to get some research done, I was able to meet more research chemists.  I broadened my own sense of my professional aspirations and, and made some contacts with whom I get Christmas cards even now.
Story_ID: 569905
Speaker 1: So now, after MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and then that summer at Celanese [Celanese Fibers Company], tell me what happens next?
Speaker 2: Next, we're now in 1974, I'm back at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], I'm chairman of the department working to get grants from the National Science Foundation and from National Institutes of Health to buy equipment, to pay for student research, to, you know, buy chemicals and supplies so that we can really develop a research capacity that we hadn't had prior to that time.  And we were fortunate to get a major grant from the National Science Foundation.  But it's interesting competition because--and Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] was a freshman congressman, and he was very helpful in getting, in getting the legislation to support that.  This is the first time I met Ted Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] because we were--we weren't exactly lobbying, we were trying to convince the [U.S.] Congress that if they really were serious about increasing the number of African Americans in science and math, they should go to where the emphasis is greatest, where the numbers are greatest and that's black colleges [HBCUs].  And so we were able to make a strong enough case to the Congress that they should create special programs to support education of African Americans who would pursue careers in science and math.  That led to creation of a program called resource centers for science and engineering.  And we along with all the other black colleges and Hispanic institutions applied for three centers.  We got the first one and that was an extraordinary feather in our cap, because we got the first one.  And it was a program that engaged elementary school kids, high school kids, college kids, graduate students not only in Atlanta [Georgia] but also in a five-state area.  And so, we thought that, that was a good model for how you can collectively bring your resources to bear on strengthening the quality of the education that African Americans would receive.  And I think we were successful.  The only problem is I got demoted from that position as director and I became provost of the university so I had to give up that. I had to give up my chair in chemistry because you couldn't be an administrator and still have a chair in chemistry.  And so I reluctantly accepted the assignment to be the provost because it was a new president [Cleveland L. Dennard].  Tom Jarrett [Thomas D. Jarrett] had retired and it was a president who I thought was struggling with trying to find his niche and trying to get his arms around the university, and I thought I could help.  I also had a personal motive because I wanted to make sure that the sciences continued to get the resources that they needed.  He was not a scientist by training.  And so I accepted his offer to join him as vice president and provost, this was in 1978.  About a year after, after--maybe two years after we got the resource center grant.
Story_ID: 569906
Speaker 1: How much was the grant?
Speaker 2: It was $3 million.  In those days that was a lot of money.  That was a lot of money, we, we, we really were--felt, felt good about that, and it was, and it was five-year grant so--and subject to, to being renewed.  And I was--we did a lot of innovative things, among them was the science academy which continued for many years after the grant moneys, moneys expired.  And some of those kids--some of those elementary school students ended up pursuing careers in science later on, and it was something like--I don't know what the numbers ended up being but for a while, it was like 90 percent of the kids that participated on Saturday ended up going to college and majoring in a math-based discipline, right.
Speaker 1: Tell me more about how the structure--the elementary kids--all of the students came in for the Saturday classes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we no, we just had an open invitation to, to the Atlanta Public Schools for kids grades third, three through eighth, because research had told us that, that's when you lose them.  If you don't get them by the time they're in the third or fourth grade, then they start doing less well in math.  So we wanted to catch them early enough and kindle, re-enforce their interest in math, and careers in science.  Lot of kids didn't even know what scientists do, you know.  And so this whole business about role models and, you know, what kind of career can I expect was new to them.  I mean, all they knew was, you know, what basketball players do and what entertainers do, and that's what they were aspiring to become as opposed to realizing that there is a real, exciting, and positive career opportunities in math and science, all right.  Numbers still now are bad but in those days, you know, African Americans represented 12 percent of the population but less than 3 percent of the scientists and engineers in this country.  And so, that clearly was a, was a gap that just needed to be closed, and that's what we were trying to do.  That was my whole--that's the only reason I went to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] in the first place, right.  So we were, we were getting some things done.  We really, were, were moving, moving ahead and that particular program was putting us on the map.  We were able to get resources to add new academic programs in the sciences, we strengthened the programs in physics and math and chemistry and biology, and were able to not only increase the number of students but also track faculty who wanted to come to a place like Atlanta University to do research and to teach.
Story_ID: 569907
Speaker 1: Okay, so now you're provost and--who was the president now of the university [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: That--then Cleveland Dennard [Cleveland L. Dennard] came in as the president.
Speaker 1: And you decided to, to work with him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he, no, he invited me after a year to, to become--I went from department chair to provost.  Had never been a dean, had never--and it was a big transition for me 'cause I, you know, I could handle the chemistry but now being provost meant I had to deal with the other schools at the university as well.  And I reached out to a friend of mine and the reason I cite this is 'cause it'll come back later as to what a great relationship developed.  But I reached out to a friend of mine at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia].  His name was Vernon Crawford [Vernon D. Crawford], he was the vice president there and he was a physicist.  And I had met him during our time working together as members of the faculty, and I said, "How do you be a provost?  What do you do when you're provost, you know?"  He said, "I'll take you to lunch and we can talk about it," so we developed a fast friendship there and he kind of served as my mentor, just what it is that a provost is supposed to do.  And I did that for three years and I became increasingly frustrated that the university was not moving in the way that I thought it ought to move and that I, I should look for another opportunity.  And then I was invited to come to West Virginia as the president of West Virginia State and--West Virginia State College [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] then in 1982.
Speaker 1: Well, now that's the college where Percy Julian [Percy Lavon Julian] was president back in the '20s [1920s] is that right?
Speaker 2: No, Percy Julian went to DePauw [DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Oh did he?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's interesting because, see, Percy Julian came to Atlanta University.  I met him.
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I invited--he came as a speaker, and the first Higgins lecturer [ph.] at Atlanta University.  He was there, just a very delightful charismatic man.  And then I went to DePauw many years later and gave the Percy Julian lecture [Percy L. Julian Memorial Lecture].
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He had since died but then.
Story_ID: 569908
Speaker 1: Tell me about your, your time as president of West Virginia State [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was scared to death.  I never knew--I had no idea what being a president was like but it was a, it was an opportunity to, to work in a new, different environment that had a, that had an extraordinary history.  West Virginia State College was a historically black school [HBCU] but with predominantly white, because in 1954 following the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], it did desegregate and it had such an extraordinarily positive academic history that when the West Virginians found that they could go to West Virginia State, they went in large numbers.  And in short order the student body went from predominantly black to predominantly white.  When I went there, it was 85 percent white and so--but it was a, it was something worth--it was an opportunity worth trying.  I, I enjoyed my time there very much.  The people of West Virginia were just extraordinarily warm and gracious, and they'll give you the shirt off their backs, you know.  It's a very poor state but in some ways had very nice qualities about the people and about the environment.  And I think it was one of the best places in the world to bring up my children [Thomas W. Cole III and Kelley Cole Graham] because they were, you know, while there were--West Virginia as a state was not big on other things, it was low on crime and low on other kinds of, of what we referred to at that time as negative statistics, right.
Speaker 1: Well, share some of the experiences there.  You're dealing with predominantly a white student body?
Speaker 2: It was a non-issue.  I mean, I didn't have any troubles adjusting and they didn't have any troubles adjusting.  Most of the students that lived in the dormitories were black.  The commuting students were largely, largely white students.  The football team was predominantly black, the baseball team was predominantly white.  It's the school that, that Leon Sullivan graduated from, he was from Charleston, West Virginia.  So it had, it had a--his presence was very much felt there, it was dormitory [Sullivan Hall] named for him.
Speaker 1: Tell me who Leon Sullivan is?
Speaker 2: Leon Sullivan of Sullivan Principles.  He was a long time pastor of a church in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], sat on several corporate boards and, and--but I think probably, internationally, is known for his Sullivan Principles in South Africa.  But it was a, it was a unique mix. Black and white faculty and teachers and students.  And the student known for his high quality in academic standings.  It was located next to a chemical plant so I felt right at home.  It was Union Carbide [Union Carbide Corporation] chemical plant, I felt right at home until--I think it was 1980, 1986 [sic. 1984] when there was the Bhopal chemical spill in India.  And the question, where else do they make MIC [methyl isocyanate], it was in this chemical plant next to West Virginia State College.  I was-I happened to be in Hawaii at the time on a visit with the, with the basketball team.  The basketball team was in a tournament over there and we, we all went over there just to, just to support them in the tournament and that was when the, when the Bhopal crisis hit.  And I was not at the campus and so I cut the trip short, went back to West Virginia in order to deal with the press and stuff like that.  And the fact that I was a chemist I think was fortuitous because I was able to, to, to calm the fears of a lot of the people had that, there may be a repeat of the Bhopal situation there in Institute [West Virginia].  It didn't, I mean, it was only marginal, it was only minor because there was extraordinary fear that it might repeat itself, but the fact that I was a chemist was, was very helpful.  And we drew the attention of the world because of our connection, our proximity.  I mean, the Union Carbide plant was on our fence line, it was right next door to the campus so if there had been a spill it would have come right through the campus, right.
Speaker 1: So, and you mentioned that Leon Sullivan had a building named for him there but they also named a telecommunications building [Cole Complex] for you, didn't they?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did.
Speaker 1: What year, what year was that?
Speaker 2: It was a building--it was built--it--the construction started before I got there and they completed the construction for that building while I was president.  They named the building for me about two years after I left.
Story_ID: 569909
Speaker 1: While you were there [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], you were also in the delegation to China--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for black scientists.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: This is shortly after Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], Nixon's visit and the ping-pong diplomacy that they talked about that opened up normalization between the United States and China.  I talked earlier about all of these, these, the relationships among scientists that developed over time.  Well, I was with a group of black scientists some in the Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] and the others from around the world, (unclear) around the United States--
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) who had some connections with some Chinese colleagues that worked at Atlanta [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], and we would just--they, really more so than I--were trying to find ways in which we could connect with China. And so, working with the National Science Foundation, were able to get grants to support a delegation of about twelve black scientists to go to, to China.  And we spent two weeks in Shanghai [China] and in Beijing [China] and Guangzhou [China] giving lectures.  I gave three lectures while I was there.  It's very nice, very interesting because, you see, science has no, no--shall I say, I mean, it's, it's--the only thing different is language.  You can communicate (unclear) at times if, if you have the language.  So I could give lectures and they were translated and I had a good time.
Speaker 1: Who were some--
Speaker 2: And guess what I talked about?  Cubane (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Cubane.
Speaker 2: Of course, yes.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the scientists that went with you?
Speaker 2: Oh, Charles Merideth, William Guillory [William A. Guillory], James Perkins, Bill Jackson [HistoryMaker William Jackson], these were all folks about the same peer group as--about the same age as I but some were from Howard University [Washington D.C.], Jackson State University [Jackson, Mississippi], Berkeley, California [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], a couple of guys from the National Science Foundation who were there on staff.  But we were all probably within four or five, six years the same age.  Shirley McBay, who at that time, working at the National Science Foundation and so it was, it was really a very, very pleasant experience.  Joe Johnson, names come to me now as I, as I think about it.  Some of them are still practicing scientists; some are not.  Some went into administration and--but there are some that are still, still practicing scientists.

Speaker 1: So, after you leave as president [of West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], you're appointed chancellor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got a call one day from a member of the Board of Regents.  We were having a meeting that day of the presidents of the West Virginia colleges and universities and I didn't know what was up, I did know that there was a disconnect between the ch- well, really among the chancellor, then chancellor and the presidents and the governor.  The person who happened to be chancellor was not popular among any of their group and we were not particularly happy with his selection of chancellors.  I get a call and it says, "If we, if we name you interim chancellor, would you be able to accept it?"  I said, "I guess I would."  We go to meeting that day, I don't say anything to anybody.  The chancellor is fired, and they called me in and talk to me for a little while and says, you know, you're the interim chancellor.  And, you know, I mean, it's something that you feel good about because it expresses confidence and a level of support, but you also, you know, know it's not something you've done before.  And I was the first black chancellor appointed in the State of West Virginia, and there were only four blacks had ever been appointed chancellors of West Virginia--I mean of state college systems in the country.  And so, I, with some trepidation, took on that assignment and it worked out fine.  I mean I was, I, I--the legislators and I got along fine.  I started my habit of eating Rolaids because I would be sitting up waiting to, waiting to calm down my stomach when I had to give testimony before all of the committees in the general assembly, but I did that for two years and it was, it was a position I was enjoying.  I had stopped looking at any opportunities to leave West Virginia.  People there were great, bought a house, kids were doing fine.  Brenda [HistoryMaker Brenda H. Cole] was the assistant attorney general.  Everything was just, was just going fine.  The, the--I mean, I think the presidents of the colleges and universities were responding to my leadership.  I wouldn't read the newspapers because, you know, I was in a high profile position and people take shots at you when you're in high profile position so I wouldn't read the paper.  I'd call my wife and I'd said, can I read the paper today?  She'd say no, really you shouldn't read the paper today 'cause they talking about you.
Speaker 1: When they talked about you, I mean, what were some of the things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's, you know, my--it's not so much me, what they're talking about is that there was always a concern that there were too many colleges and universities for a small state like West Virginia.  There were three medical schools and there were sixteen, you know, colleges and universities and so--and I had to defend that.  And so they would take, they would take shots at me.  I'll never forget that the, the editor publisher of the Charleston Gazette [Charleston Gazette-Mail] and I became fairly, fairly good friends and he was, he was really a brilliant newspaper guy, and he wrote a negative article about me and our offices were next door.  And I just went over to see him and I called him a racist and I said, "You know, you, you're taking shots at me unnecessarily."  He said, "Sit down."  He said, "Let me tell you something."  He said, "What do you think this country would be like if it wasn't for the press?  Somebody's gotta hold people accountable, and the only independent objective group that can do that with impunity is the press.  Sometimes we're wrong sometimes we're right, but just think how much worse off we'd be if you didn't have the press."  And I, I stopped and thought about it, and we ended up being friends.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well--
Speaker 2: I learned a lot.
Story_ID: 569911
Speaker 1: Well they might've taken shots at, at you but weren't people looking at you to run for governor?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was a high profile position [chancellor, West Virginia Board of Regents] and several people had asked me--indicated that since I had done so well given the, the high profile nature of the position and both dealing with the governor--governor and I were on a first name basis, the then governor.  Jay Rockefeller was the governor when I sent to West Virginia but his term expired and then he ended up, you know, going to the [U.S.] Senate but governors who followed him, I mean, I had to work with them.  And I had to work with senators and members of the House of Delegates so I was running--I played tennis regularly with, with one of the senators there.  And so I was running in that crowd I guess is, is the way to put it.  And so, when people talk about possibilities, people that might be, or (unclear) who might be considered to run for public office my name surfaced a time or two.  And I'm not sure how far it would have gone but it is more a reflection of the profile that I had in the state than I think in anything else.
Story_ID: 569912
Speaker 1: So what made you decide to leave West Virginia?
Speaker 2: The only job in, in, in the world I would've left West Virginia for was the job I took.  I was contacted shortly after I was named chancellor [of the West Virginia Board of Regents] to return to Atlanta [Georgia] as president of Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  I said no.  I've just been appointed here and there's no way, it's too soon.  I can't leave now.  And so that died down for a couple of months, the person that called me initially was Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] and he's not the person you can easily say, say no to so we talked about it and he said, "Let's pray over and I'll get back to you."  So he called me about three months later and he said, they still interested in you, you know, what, what--we really would like for you to at least go down for an interview.  Well, about this time, Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] was experiencing financial difficulties and Clark College was without a president and so, if ever there was a time when two schools might combine their resources, this was the time to do it.  Having been at Atlanta University, I knew something about that situation, I knew what the struggles were, I was a known entity there, and the conversations had started at least opening up the doors for broadening the collaboration between the two schools.  And I said, well that might be worth doing. So we'll talk about it.  So all through the summer of 1977, 1987 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came to Atlanta and I stood over it and I said, you know, it's something that, that's exciting.  It's an exciting challenge to do but I'm not sure.  And then the president of Atlanta University resigned.
Speaker 1: And who was that president?
Speaker 2: That was [HistoryMaker] Luther Williams.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so both positions were open.  And the chairman of the board of trustees of Atlanta University and I were friends.  The chairman of the board of Clark College, we knew each other but we weren't, we weren't personal friends, but it was he who was trying to get me to come as president of Clark.  So, the deal was you come as president of Clark and we will continue the conversations and should it get to a point that the two schools come together, you'd be president of the resulting school.  No promises, no guarantees, you know, no commitments other than if you come as president of Clark College maybe we'll get to the point where the two schools will come together.
Story_ID: 569913
Speaker 1: So what happened if you would come and be president of Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, y- you know I really thought after considering the pros and cons that this the job that I was called to do.  I had been at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], Clark College was a United Methodist religious school, I'm a lifelong United Methodist.  Having been in the AUC Center [Atlanta University Center; Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], I knew half of the faculty at Clark College anyway and I knew them at Atlanta University.  I had been president of a school, chancellor of a system, what better opportunity now to take all of that and use it to, to create a new university.  And that's in fact how we saw it.  Though we knew that Atlanta University needed something, an infusion of, of money or restructuring to, to survive, Clark College was, was constricted in terms of its development.  It was landlocked, couldn't do anything really beyond what it was doing.  Both schools were without a president so if there was a time to bring them together this was it.  The only time.  And after having lost a lot of sleep and deliberated and consulted with a lot of people, I finally decided in September of '87 [1987] to, to accept the assignment.  Because, if it's gonna happen, I thought it was a, a situation whose time had come.  There had been a lot of prior attempts to bring the schools in the Atlanta University Center together, none of them had been successful.  In fact, the word was you are not gonna be able to do, and so, being a known entity to Atlanta University and being--having been president of Clark College at the time meant I could bring a little bit of both to the conversation that would, that would eventually lead to consolidation.  And so for four months I commuted from West Virginia to Atlanta [Georgia] meeting privately with the board members to orchestrate, if you will, to talk about how do you pull this off.  And so by December--between September and December then word was already out that I was coming as president of Clark College and that there is talk--they had a press conference and said that they were talking about bringing the schools together, but really between September and October we had worked it out.  The chairs of both boards wanted to do it and so it was really just a matter now of dotting the I's and crossing the Ts and making sure that people who needed to know knew.  So they created committees and the usual process like that and deliberated on the issues, the academic issues, the financial issues, the alumni issues, the student issues, and all that.  And between January and March of 1988, we decided, or the committee actually decided with my--in--I was really kind of like the, the staff person to the committee.  The committee decided on a name, decided on a mascot, decided on, on a motto, decided on all of that because the atmosphere among the members of the committee representing both schools was we wanna make this work.  The question is how do we make it work?  We know who the president's gonna be so that's a non-issue.  Getting the name may be an issue, some of the--where people will end up might be an issue but we'll just have to work that out.  And between--in that three-month period they had decided, went public.
Story_ID: 569914
Speaker 1: People told me behind the scenes, you're not gonna be able to pull it off, that you really don't wanna do this, the last person that tried to do it died in office.  We ran into a slight accreditation snag because the schools were separately accredited and in order to get them accredited as a single institution we had to go to another step of the process so that delayed the process a year.  And that's why I ended up being president of Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and president of Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] at the same time, 'cause we had to delay the accreditation process.  But it was actually fortuitous because remember the guy I told you, Vernon Crawford [Vernon D. Crawford], he had since retired as chancellor of the Georgia Board of Regents [Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia] and when he heard about this he called me up and said, "Tom [HistoryMaker Thomas W. Cole], can I help?"  I said, "You certainly can."  So I invited him to chair a committee of outsiders to come in and, and give us the benefit of their thinking on what we were trying to do and he had such an enormously positive reputation that it just helped to having him say grace over what we were doing.  And I then I continued him for another year where he chaired the steering committee composed of equal number of faculty and staff from both schools to work out the nuts and bolts and details.  So that by, by spring of 1989, everything was decided.  The faculty were on board, the alumni were on board, and the students were just--they were the cheerleaders.  The, the boards decided to come together with an equal number from each side.  The two chairs of the boards agreed to be co-chairs for a year until things kind of worked out.  There was hardly any major criticism or complication.  We agreed on calling it a consolidation rather than a merger.  And one of the reasons is, is that they have different connotations both legally and from a practical standpoint.  During this time when I was shuttling from West Virginia to Atlanta [Georgia], I was also going into other cities where they had, had similar combinations of institutions, Case Western Reserve [Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio], Vanderbilt Peabody [Vanderbilt University, Peabody College of Education and Human Development, Nashville, Tennessee] were the two that I spent most of my research on.  And what I learned from those experiences is how not to do it, for us, right.  And we so chose the consolidation route because what that meant was that the two schools went out of existence and created a third one, or actually, created third one and then went out of existence.  So they came to the consolidation equal.  One school had its advantages and the other school had certain advantages.  And by and large things worked fine, clearly there were some wrinkles.  You know, there were some things I would do differently now if I had to do it all over again.  I'm writing a book about it and hopefully it'll be done by next summer.  And, you know, I'm gonna try to be honest about it in terms of, terms of what went wrong and what to avoid, you know, for people who are considering doing things like this again.  But the enrollment went from three thousand to almost six thousand.  The operating budget went from 40 million to 120 million, we added almost a half a billion dollars in assets over, over a sixteen year period.  It was, at one point, one of the most attractive schools for freshmen to send their SAT scores to.  During its heyday in the mid-fifties before the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia], we would get twelve thousand applications for the freshmen class.  So, it was really an exciting time to be, to be at the university.  We had an easy time getting dignitaries to come, I mean, we, we had convocations for Nelson Mandela and Bishop--Archbishop Tutu [Desmond Tutu] and Johnnie Cochran, and just--Leon Sullivan I told you, but it was just a great time to be at the university.
Story_ID: 569915
Speaker 1: And then things changed in Washington [D.C.], and remember the big change in 1994 when the [U.S.] Congress went from Democratic to Republican (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Republican, yes.
Speaker 1: And much of our base for support, we had built a lot of the support on federal grants and federal contracts and federal support and the whole landscape of support for higher education changed in 1994.  And while--and it, it had a ripple effect on the support we had for the university.  But the good news is that we were able to get most of the building construction done prior to that time and the land acquisition, the building renovations.  We built a $40 million science complex, at that time was one of the largest on any historically black college or university [HBCU] campus.  We were part of the group that hosted the '96 Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics Atlanta, Georgia].  Another time when I was frightened half to death 'cause I knew the world was gonna be watching and I just--the women's soccer venue was on our campus--no, field hockey venue was on our campus.  And I just knew something was gonna happen and it would get international attention.  It didn't.  Things went just fine.  But it was, it was an exciting time, and I was able to I think with the kind of board and staff and faculty support we were able to attract great students and good financial support that built the university that was in a special category among black colleges in American higher education.  It was a private school, research-oriented, getting federal grants, and it was ranked in a special category according to the Carnegie classification system [Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education].  As a private school, they called it research intensive and see--and that was a departure from black colleges as a rule.  Black colleges, other than Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and other than a few others, were noted for teaching schools and not research. And we had a major emphasis in teaching and research.
Speaker 2: When the landscape changed in '94 [1994] what did that do for, for the school?
Speaker 1: It, it rippled down in terms of the access of federal grants that we had.  Back when we--in that year our operating budget was $120 million, half of that was federal.  We, we--mostly from the [U.S.] Department of Energy, department of National Science Foundation, from--and from other agencies.  We were doing, we were doing $50 million a year in research grants and contracts.  This is research for the federal government, probably as much as any black school in the country at that time.  And so, when the money stopped or the programs stopped then we started--we had to cut back on faculty, and see, one of the major ways in which federal dollars are used to support your institution is through what is called an indirect cost.  And that is, they pay you to do the research and so it carries with it an indirect cost, which is used to help the infrastructure, all right, that helps drive the institution.  And so, that impact over time resulted in our budget--I'll give you, I'll give you a particular example.  We had a $15 million a year Head Start program, the largest in the Southeast.  And what was exciting about it for us is that we were, we were exposed to kids from Head Start all the way to Ph.D. programs because we had the Head Start kids, we had the Saturday science academy kids, we had college, we had graduate students and we had post-graduate students.  We had an emphasis in international affairs.  We created a School of International Affairs [Clark Atlanta University School of International Affairs and Development, Atlanta, Georgia], we added several new languages, Arabic, we were already doing German and French and Spanish but we added Arabic.  And with the other schools in the Center, the AU Center [Atlanta University Center; Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], I think there were something like twelve languages that were being taught.  And so, it was really a--what I thought--what I would describe as a heyday because there was so much going on, so much excitement, so much activity.  And when you're in a growth mode it feels better than when you're retrenching.
Story_ID: 569916
Speaker 1: Talking about the school being an internation-  internat- dealing with international affairs--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were one of the first presidents of Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] to visit Germany and NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] in '89 [1989], tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I thought if we're gonna do a creditable job in the international arena, I needed to have some more exposure.  The earlier trip to China was the only one other than going to Mexico that I had, had out of the country and so I was given the opportunity to join a group visiting NATO.  And so, the ideas is to expose what the United States was doing to lay people so that when we come back to the United States we will be knowledgeable about what the country is, is doing.  And so we went to Brussels [Belgium], we went to Frankfurt [Germany], we went to--we didn't go to Berlin [Germany] but we were at the--but we were close to before the Wall [Berlin Wall] came down so we were at the fence. And we could see where East Germans wanted to cross--attempted to cross the fence in order, in order to get to, to West Germany.  And so, we spent most of our time dealing with, you know, NATO installations as they explained what it was keeping the peace and rationalizing why there were so many Americans there, and just really trying to give, to give us a chance to, to understand and communicate as lay people--did the same thing with CIA [Central Intelligence Agency]. I was with a group that visited the CIA and, you know, most people think of the CIA as a clandestine organization, right? And what they wanted us to know is that we do some things that are not clandestine.  There's a reason why we do what we do and it's PR [public relations].  It's really, it's really this was PR.  And some of the things were very positive and very exciting but we couldn't lose the taste that the CIA is a, is a clandestine group--and the country probably needs some element like that.  And so its--but it helps when they communicate to lay people what they're trying to do, I think.  And so that's, that was one of the reasons I accepted the assignment to go to Germany.  My biggest international experience though was in Egypt.  Six months after I became president I got a call from the minister of health of Egypt and he said, (accent) "Mr. Cole [HistoryMaker Thomas W. Cole], when are you coming to Egypt to sign this contract?"  I said, "What contract?"  As it turns out, the university had written a proposal and gotten funded $25 million to for ten years, to work with the--no, for five years to work with the Ministry of Health [Ministry of Health and Population] the government of Egypt on infant mortality and morbidity studies to improve the quality of health for the children of Egypt.  And he said, "If you don't get over here in the next two weeks, we're gonna remove you as the technical assistance advisor."  Well, it turned out that there had been a lot of give and take during the time we were preparing for the consolidation.  But I didn't know about it.  So to make a long story short, I talked to some of my colleagues at the university on the Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] side where it was initiated, found out the origin of it, went to Cairo [Egypt] and in three days signed a contract and agreed to do the work and then came back to the United States.  I had to go back.  I didn't have to, I went back to Cairo six times over the course of the grant just to make sure that things were operating as we had promised they would.  Because we were, we were rookies in doing international development work and we made rookie mistakes, and the prestige of the university was at stake and I simply was not gonna let that project fester or, or be challenged or be questioned.  It was also, again to get back to this pre-1994 thing, Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III] had authored an amendment that required the, the federal government to give certain number of his contracts to black colleges [HBCUs] or at least include them in the, in the competition and I didn't wanna disappoint him.  And so we were able to turn that program into a very, very successful project that was lauded by WHO [World Health Organization] and by UNICEF [United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund] and all the international organizations as an extraordinarily valuable use of USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development] money to improve the quality of life for children of Egypt.  I don't know if you've ever been to Cairo but you, you, you--it's a must (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I have.
Speaker 2: You have?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 569917
Speaker 1: So you stay at Atlanta University [sic.] until what year?
Speaker 2: Until 2002.  It was Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Clark Atlanta, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what happens then?
Speaker 2: I retired.
Speaker 1: You retired from the school but you didn't retire really.
Speaker 2: I retired from the school for a year and then I started, I started working on a book. Gathering my papers and things like that.  And then I was approached by a local group to work with the Atlanta Public Schools, an organization called Great Schools Atlanta [Atlanta, Georgia].  And it really was created as a independent objective third-party group to focus on public education in Atlanta [Georgia].  And I worked with that group for two years.  And I retired for the second time this past summer and my now intent is to finish that book.  It's really a--you know how you, you know you should be doing something and you don't really get your arms around it and you feel guilty 'cause you haven't done it and that's kind of where I am with the book.  And it's, it's almost finished but I, I've got to get that done.
Speaker 1: Did you wanna talk more about Great Schools of Atlanta [sic. Great Schools Atlanta]?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, you know, the Atlanta Public Schools is like many urban systems the source of very positive developments but also a source of a lot of criticism.  Still major gaps between the performance of black students and white students.  And so the superintendent is really--has quite a challenge trying to turn that system around.  There are some things she can do and say that would appear self-serving but if an independent group talks about it, then it's more believable because a group has no axe to grind and no vested interest.  And so that was a role that we played with the Great Schools Atlanta, it was a group of citizens that could be critical of the superintendent but also supportive, all right, and help her articulate to the larger community what in fact was happening and what is not with the public schools.
Story_ID: 569918
Speaker 1: Where does the pro- Project Kaleidoscope, where does that come in?
Speaker 2: Project Kaleidoscope is a--I guess the name is catchier than, than what we did.  This goes back to my, my time on the faculty, science faculty [at Clark University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And it really was a group of scientists who work at largely small liberal arts colleges that were large colleges, who had the same objective that we had at Clark Atlanta [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] producing more graduates in science and math, and engineering but the focus was how best to teach science.  Are we gonna be like a factory and we just turn out numbers or is there a, a better way to teach science?  And that's what Project Kaleidoscope focused on, undergraduate teaching of science and math at liberal arts colleges not just black colleges [HBCUs]. (Cough) Excuse me. Not just black colleges but liberal arts colleges. (Cough) And I worked with that group for, oh, for about ten years.
Story_ID: 569919
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not talked about that you would like to talk about? (Laughter) Is there something that we missed?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, I think you been thorough in your, in your questions.  You know, I think the--for me the--you know when you talk about, talk about HistoryMakers, and I may be more sentimental about this than, than is fair but I think even now that not too many people could've pulled off that consolidation [Clark Atlanta University consolidation].  And what it--the message and the message I'm trying to put in a book is that it is a convergence of events and people and circumstances, that if it happened at any other year or involving a change in one or two of the personalities (background noise) it would not have happened.
Speaker 1: So, with that would you say that was the highlight of your career?
Speaker 2: As far as I'm concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, when you look back over your life, that being the highlight, would there be anything that you would have changed?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  I would've, I would've hired more of me (laughter) or at least--you know, it was--I'm talking about working eighty-hour weeks.  My wife [HistoryMaker Brenda H. Cole] was reading one draft of the, of the book I'm writing and she said, "No wonder I didn't see much of you.  You all did so much work and you got so many things done."  I was all over the place, you know.  I became a, a Delta [Delta Air Lines, Inc.] miler, platinum miler because I was always gone.  But because I was always gone doing, you know, both PR [public relations] and fundraising, I was not on campus as much as would like to have been.  And I would like--and wish I could have spent more time with students and more time with faculty and staff helping them to understand what we were doing and why we were doing it. Because there was a void and when you go from operating one way under a set of understandings and parameters and you change all of that in a relatively quick time, people get confused and people get out of sorts and because they don't know how it impacts on them.  And so, if I could have spent more time trying to help people adjust to the change, I think, I think it would have helped.  But, beyond that I think, I think we did about, about as well as we could.  It was, it was--and I think if you talk to anybody who was part of that team of people, of faculty, administration and staff, you'd probably get some of the same kinds of answers.  It was all so new that we were just busy getting things done.  And then you look back over your shoulder and say, well, we--you know, this is good.  But it would have been nice if we could have done some more handholding in this process.
Story_ID: 569920
Speaker 1: What are your concerns for the future generation?
Speaker 2: Well, I am, I'm concerned first that we're going back to re-segregated schools.  I don't think that's good.  And I don't have an answer to it, given housing patterns as they are and given still the vestiges of racism in everything in America that's something that you just have to work at and continue to work at.  It's like when we desegregated, we assumed things now were just gonna settle and everybody was gonna behave, you know, with civility.  It didn't happen, and it's in part because we let go of the reins and we didn't stay and hold things.  That's--and see--even in the consolidation of Clark--to create Clark Atlanta [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] we let go of the reins too soon and then people just started kind of moving and going to their own directions and we had to, had to find ways to pull it back.  Well, I'm concerned about the, the state of education of African Americans in this country and I'm not sure we're better off now than we were thirty years ago.  Some schools' systems are doing fine but urban systems are not.  That's one of the reasons that I was working with Great Schools Atlanta [Atlanta, Georgia] because, you know, you can get very passionate about what, in fact, are you doing with the next generation and there is every reason to be concerned about that.  Now don't go to the international scene, you got real serious challenges there.  But just in terms of, terms of education I'm quite, quite concerned that going back to re-segregated schools is not helpful.

Speaker 1: Tell me how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter). Like everybody else.  That he was a nice guy, that he was smart, that he, he provided a unique quality of leadership at a critical point in time.  I think those kinds of adjectives, you know, is, is what most people think they wanna be remembered as.  I know that won't be the case (laughter) but at least you asked me how would I want to be remembered.
