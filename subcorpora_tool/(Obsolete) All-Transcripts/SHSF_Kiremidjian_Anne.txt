Kiefer: My name is Joyce Kiefer, and I’m with the Stanford Historical Society Oral
History Project. Today is May 20th, 2016. I’m here with Anne Kiremidjian, a
professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Anne’s specialty is
structural engineering with a particular emphasis on the effects of
earthquakes. I’d like to begin by asking her to begin her story with her
experience of growing up.
Kiremidjian: [00:00:59] Thank you, Joyce. It’s a pleasure for me to be here today. My
history’s quite long at this point of my life, of course, and I’ve had many,
many exciting experiences. Looking back I couldn’t have imagined that my
life would take some of the turns and twists that have taken place over the
years. I was born in Bulgaria during the peak of communism. It was in 1965
that my family decided to immigrate and come to the United States. That
trip, that exodus, was quite exciting, very unusual, and had its own different
turns and twists. We left Bulgaria, five members of our family--my brother,
my mother, and my father, and my grandmother. Because we had declared

13

that we were going potentially to the United States, the government took our
passports away and gave us $20 per person to leave the country. [00:02:30]
I look back and I really admire my parents for being so brave to take
the entire family with confidence that they would be able to succeed leaving
Bulgaria and moving to a place where they had no idea what to expect. The
trip itself was very eventful. We boarded a ship in Varna, one of the main
ports on the Black Sea of Bulgaria. The name of the ship, ironically enough,
was Armenia. I failed to say that the only reason why we could leave Bulgaria
was because my father was Armenian, and there was a short period of time
when all the Communist Bloc countries were allowing minorities to leave and
go to a place of their choice. Had we been purely Bulgarian--which my
mother was, but because she was married to an Armenian they allowed her to
come along--had we been Bulgarian we could have never left legally.
[00:03:23]
To make the long story short, we took a ship called Armenia and
traveled through the Bosporus and through Athens. The ship stopped along
the way in many places. I still remember the morning of the day after we left.
I got up very early, and we were passing through the Bosporus. We didn’t
stop in Istanbul, but I did see the beautiful skyline of Istanbul. It was very,
very inspiring to me. It was one of my first experiences outside of Bulgaria
where I witnessed some of the architectural and civil engineering
achievements around the world with the minarets of Hagia Sophia. I’d had
early interest in architecture because my best friend’s parents, both husband
and wife, were architects. Going through the Bosporus brought my very first

14

reality to what some of the architectural achievements have been over the
years.
The next stop of the ship was in Athens. The Greeks were very
sympathetic, and even though we didn’t have a passport, they allowed us to
come off the ship and visit Athens. This was my first trip to the Acropolis.
Again, another phenomenal architectural achievement--a civil engineering,
structural engineering achievement that made a very strong impression on
me and just increased my interest in architecture and engineering. Then we
stopped in Egypt but were not allowed to get off. We stopped in Cyprus and
visited the tomb of Othello and Desdemona. I’m probably mispronouncing
them and I’m still probably using the pronunciation that I grew up with.
[laughter] That’s quite all right, and I think makes it more authentic.
[00:05:32]
I grew up with opera, so Othello had a specific meaning to me. My
mother sang beautifully, and I went to the opera when I was only eleven for
the first time so I knew the story of Othello and Desdemona. It was very
impressive for me. I was so pleased to have been able to visit the burial place
of Othello and Desdemona and Nicosia. Then we went through Latakia,
Syria, and our destination was Beirut, Lebanon. Now you are going to ask
why Beirut, Lebanon, if you wanted to come to the United States. The
Bulgarians would have never allowed us to come directly to the United
States. Also, we would have had to wait for a visa. The visa process was very
extensive. [00:06:24]

15

As soon as we were told that we could leave Bulgaria, we took the
first opportunity to leave. We didn’t want to wait another three, four or five
months to get a visa for the United States, because it took that long. Actually,
it took longer once we were in Beirut to get a visa to the United States. The
vetting process was very thorough, especially for someone coming from a
communist country. You may remember the Cold War era, and this was at
the peak of the Cold War era--1965. Times were very contentious between
the United States and the Soviet Bloc countries.
Beirut was a very interesting experience. It was in total contrast to
what Bulgaria was like. [00:07:11] Bulgaria was a very homogeneous society
and Beirut was a conglomerate of a lot of different cultures and a lot of
Armenians. The Armenian Church was very influential at the time, and they
were the ones who were helping all the immigrants coming from Bulgaria
and Romania and Poland and the Czech Republic and wherever else they
may be coming from. They helped my parents get a job right away and had
arranged for an apartment for us in Beirut. We spent seven and a half
months in Beirut. It was a very eye-opening experience. I have to say that
[laughter] as a teenager not in a predominantly Muslim country, but in a city
with parts that were predominantly Muslim, it was an interesting experience
where you could sense how women were treated. We, of course, kept mostly
to the Armenian society. I tried to take some English classes, but I have to
admit I was quite lazy. [laughter] [00:08:38]
Kiefer: You were sixteen at the time?

16

Kiremidjian: I was fifteen. I actually turned sixteen while we were there. We arrived in
April and left in the end of November. I turned sixteen in Beirut in August.
My arrival in the United States was right after Thanksgiving. Everybody
informed us we had just missed one of the biggest celebrations of the Turkey
Day. That’s what my friends called it, the Turkey Day. [laughter] It was later
on that I found out the meaning of Thanksgiving and why it was celebrated.
When we first arrived, we were told we just missed the Turkey Day
celebration.
Kiefer: Had you eaten turkey before?
Kiremidjian: [00:09:26] Not really. Not that I could remember. Turkey was not considered
to be a particularly delicious food or poultry. We ate a lot of chicken but not
turkey. Coming to the United States--I remember the very first morning after
arriving. This was in New York City. My brother and I walked out and I was
overwhelmed by the skyscrapers. That was my third experience with
architecture and structural engineering and the civil engineering
achievements. We walked around. I’d never seen such tall buildings. I’d never
seen so many buildings. [laughter] None of us spoke any English in the
whole family. Our English was limited to “Hello. How are you? Goodbye.
Good morning. Good evening.” That was the extent of all of our English.
We settled in an apartment in Queens, again, through the Armenian
Church organization called ANCHA. They were extremely helpful all the
way, both in Beirut and when we arrived in New York. We settled in Forest
Hills, New York. One of the local Armenian ladies who lived in Forest Hills
took me to Forest Hills High School to register. Now in Bulgaria I had just

17

started high school. I was in ninth grade and had finished the first semester
of ninth grade. The high school that I went to emphasized math and
sciences. I was in a math and physics curriculum in high school.
When I got to Forest Hills High, well, the first thing that happened,
my name got changed [laughter]. My baptismal name is Aghavny which is
spelled A-G-H-A-V-N-Y, and mispronounced even in Bulgaria because it
was so unusual and difficult. When I went to Bulgarian schools they didn’t
know how to pronounce that and all my teachers kept mispronouncing it.
Kiefer: Was this an Armenian name?
Kiremidjian: [00:11:55] It is a purely Armenian name. When I went to register the lady
asked me, “What is your name?”
I said, “Aghavny Setian.”
She said, “How do you spell that?”
I said, “A-G-H-A-V-N-Y.”
She looked at me, and she said, “What do your friends call you?”
I said, “Annie.”
“Ah. From here on you’re Anne.”
So now I’ve been Anne since then. [laughter] I have to say, it’s served me
well and I should thank that lady because I think the other women that I
know named Aghavny have had considerable difficulty with having it
pronounced and spelled. My last name currently is difficult enough. [laughter]
I don’t need two names that are really difficult so I’m glad for the easier
Anne version of my name.

18

More interestingly, I was enrolled in ninth grade math which was
when algebra was taught at the time. By the middle of December I was
expected to take the Math Regents Exam in algebra. I didn’t speak any
English, but for algebra you don’t really need English. I scored 98 on the
Math Regents Exam.
Kiefer: What is the Regents Exam?
Kiremidjian: [00:13:17] It’s part of the New York State Educational System. At the end of
every semester or year, you take the exam to show academic proficiency in a
particular subject. In algebra you take the Algebra Regents Exam. In physics
you take the Physics Regents Exam. I will come back to the Regents Exam a
little later because I did fail one.
Kiefer: And you’ll tell us which one you failed?
Kiremidjian: [00:13:47] Right. I will. Actually, it was pivotal in a lot of the things that
happened afterwards. The following semester I was placed in geometry, but
I’d already taken all the geometry that was being covered. I went to the chair
of the math department. With my broken English, I tried to explain to her
that I’d already had that math. She looked at me and said, “Really? You are
what? In ninth grade?” I said, “Yes.” She gave me a piece of paper with two
problems to solve. I knew the answer because I’d had similar problems on
tests back in Bulgaria. I solved them rather quickly and gave them back to
her. I still remember the expression of surprise on her face.
Then I was placed in advanced pre-calculus class. My experience with
the physics was similar in chemistry. I had real difficulty with English. I
remember reading Macbeth with a dictionary until the wee hours of the

19

morning and still not understanding very much. Then we read--I can’t
remember which short story it was, but my report must have been pretty
horrific because the teacher came in and said, “Who wrote this piece of
garbage?” [laughter]
Kiefer: Oh, dear. [laughter]
Kiremidjian: [00:15:28] I had to explain to him afterwards that it was me and I didn’t
speak English, and English was a second language for me and I was just
learning. He felt very apologetic. I had a second experience like that later on
in college. English was a struggle. I could speak broken English in about
three and a half, four months, after we had arrived, but learning English was
one of my main challenges.
Kiefer: They didn’t have an English as a second language program?
Kiremidjian: [00:16:00] Oh, no. I was one of four foreign students at the time in the entire
school of--I can’t remember how many. There was no such thing as English
for foreign students. There were evening classes that my parents tried to take,
and I tried to attend some of those, but there were no special classes within
the school. I have to say, I knew I had to learn English and I did make a
tremendous effort to learn as much as I could as quickly as I could. Even
with all my efforts, the very last semester of high school I had to take the
American History Regents Exam. Again, American history for me was a
totally new subject because they didn’t teach American history in Bulgaria
because it was that capitalistic imperialistic country that should not have
existed altogether as far as they were concerned.

20

I did okay on the American History Regents Exam. I passed that. But
I did fail the English Regents Exam. As a result, I could not get an academic
diploma because it was required to have passed the Regents Exam. Instead I
was given a general high school diploma that is not worth anything. That
semester I not only failed the English Regents Exam, but I had applied to
several colleges because I was determined to go to college. I knew I wanted
to be an engineer. In fact, in my high school yearbook under my picture it
says, “Civil Engineer,” surprisingly enough. [00:17:57]
I guess early on I realized that I cannot be an architect because my
freehand drawing is not great. But I was always very good in math and
physics. Civil engineering was the next thing to being an architect. I guess
early on I had decided that I was going to be a civil engineer. That’s what it
says in my yearbook. Where was I going with that? Yes. That semester I
applied to several schools, including City College and Queens College of
New York, which is part of the City College system, and C. W. Post. I can’t
remember how many colleges I applied to. My parents couldn’t help me with
the applications. I’m amazed what parents do today to help their kids with
applying to colleges. I didn’t have anybody to tell me how to fill out an
application, what should I be emphasizing. I had to figure all that out on my
own.
Kiefer: No counselors in the high school.
Kiremidjian: [00:19:04] No. Perhaps there were, but I just didn’t realize that I could ask
for help. I had to figure it out all on my own. Not surprisingly enough, I got
rejected by every single college that I’d applied to. That spring I got a general

21

diploma instead of an academic diploma, and I didn’t get accepted to any
college that I was hoping to go to, so what was I supposed to do? I was
determined. I knew I was going to go to college. Whatever it took I was
going to go to college. I took some typing classes for two weeks and took a
job for the summer with a travel agency after I had finished my very
extensive typing. I’m still the worst typist in the world. [laughter]
I took a typing job with this travel agency and I was working for this
lady who was a chain smoker and very neurotic. She informed me that the
only thing I’m supposed to do is answer the phone and pass it on to her. I
shouldn’t discuss anything about travel arrangements with any of her clients.
She was busy on the phone with another client one day and that one client
wanted information right then and there and I gave her the information. That
was a major no-no. She fired me on the spot.
Kiefer: You probably knew much more about travel than she did.
Kiremidjian: [00:20:49] I really don’t know. Travel agents at the time did travel quite a bit I
believe. My recollection was that part of their perk was to get free travel to
places. She probably had traveled a bit. I had the whole experience in travel.
Yes, you’re quite correct. I got fired. Then I searched for a job again and
found a job at Kidder Peabody [Kidder, Peabody & Co.], one of the financial
companies on Wall Street at the time. I don’t think they exist anymore. [They
closed in 1994.] I was hired as a keypunch operator, a job which doesn’t exist
anymore either. [laughter]
Kiefer: Right. [laughter]

22

Kiremidjian: [00:21:39] I worked as a keypunch operator on this big machine, punching
cards and typing on cards, all the information of all the trades from the day
before and that had to be entered and recorded. I worked there for the rest
of the summer. September came and I was ready to register for night school
at Queens College, because I was going to go to night school for a semester
or two and then try to transfer during the day. That was my plan. I went to
my supervisor and asked if I come half an hour early, can I leave half an hour
early so that I can get from Wall Street, New York, to Queens College, which
was during rush hour a good hour to get to the Queens College campus. She
turned around and she fired me. [laughter] I have to admit, I must have been
a pretty lousy typist, otherwise I really don’t know why she would fire me.
But she did.
Kiefer: It looks like now you have no choice but to get into college.
Kiremidjian: [00:23:03] No college wanted me except for going to night school. That week
I spent at home trying to figure out what I’m doing with my life. It was time
for me to go register for night school and I was just about to leave my house.
You know, there are those moments in your life that you remember every
second of it.
Kiefer: Exactly.
Kiremidjian: I’ve remembered that particular five or ten minutes of my life forever.
Kiefer: Okay. Put us there.
Kiremidjian: [00:23:33] Right. I’m ready to walk out of the house and the phone rings. The
phone was all the way in the kitchen. I was right by the front door. I stopped

23

and I said, “Oh, do I answer? Do I not answer? Okay. Let me go and
answer.” I walked back and I picked up the phone. It was Queens College.
They said, “Oh. Is this Anne Setian?
I said, “Yes.”
They said, “Well, we’re calling from the admissions office. And we
see that you have done extremely well in math and physics and chemistry,
but you seem to have difficulties with English. Are you a foreign student?
Have you been in the country very long?”
I said, “No. I’ve been in the country for only a year and a half. And I
didn’t speak any English so I’ve been learning English as much as I can.”
The lady on the other end said, “Well, you’ve also declared preengineering.” They didn’t have an engineering program so my idea was to go
for three years to Queens and then transfer to another school. She said,
“Well, we like your math and physics background, and you’re obviously not
going to major in English or history or any of the humanities. If you promise,
however, to take more English classes, we have a spot for you as a regular
student.” I still get goose bumps when I say that.
Kiefer: Oh, that’s wonderful.
Kiremidjian: [00:25:19] It was such a phenomenal moment in my life. Even brings tears to
my eyes because it turned my life around.
Kiefer: Ah, that’s wonderful.
Kiremidjian: [00:25:30] So I registered as a regular student and went on for three years at
Queens College. I took every physics and math class that I possibly could
take. In fact, I had so many classes in math and physics that the chair of the

24

Department of Physics wanted to give me a physics degree before I
transferred, and I said, “No. I want to go to into engineering.” They were all
wondering why would I want to do that. I could get my degree right there at
the end of the third year. I had more than enough units and more than
enough credits. I was determined to go to an engineering school and become
an engineer. I didn’t want to be a physicist even though I did quite well.
At the end of the third year I had the option to go to City College of
New York and NYU and Columbia. I chose Columbia, and Columbia gave
me a partial scholarship. I did get another scholarship from a foundation
called the Gulbenkian Foundation. It supports Armenian students primarily.
I went to Columbia and finished my bachelor’s degree in civil engineering
there. I remember at Queens College being the only woman in my physics
and math classes. I still remember walking into the very first physics class.
Up to that point, I hadn’t realized that it was not common for women to be
engineers. The mother of my best friend from growing up was an architect
and I knew other women who were engineers in Bulgaria. I didn’t think I was
doing anything unusual.
Kiefer: Would you say that in Bulgaria it was more common for women to study the
sciences and math?
Kiremidjian: [00:27:37] Absolutely.
Kiefer:

There was no stigma, or was there?

Kiremidjian: [00:27:40] If there was, I didn’t see it. I did see a lot of women in math and
science. In the high school that I went to, there were just as many young
ladies as there were young men. I don’t think I ever heard anyone say, “Oh,

25

you’re a girl. You cannot do math or physics.” I never heard that. I hear that
in the United States even today, which is so sad. I never heard that growing
up.
Kiefer: That’s amazing. That growing up period was during the 1950s and 1960s-Kiremidjian: Correct.
Kiefer: --when it was even worse in the U.S. than it is now when people are trying to
incorporate women and girls, but not then at the time.
Kiremidjian: Oh, at the time it was very unusual. I remember the high school counselor [in
New York] when I told him that I’m going to be a civil engineer, he started
laughing-Kiefer: [laughter] Oh, dear.
Kiremidjian: [00:28:36] --and didn’t say more than that. He just laughed. He said, “You
want to be a civil engineer?” Of course, I was this tiny little girl who barely
weighed 105 pounds and had the pixie short haircut. Even though I was
seventeen I probably looked more like twelve. [laughter] I wasn’t wearing the
makeup that all the other girls were wearing and looked probably more
innocent and immature than anyone else. But my mind was made up. When I
went to Queens College, in my very first physics class, there were six
hundred students in Physics I. Out of the six hundred or so students, there
were only six women. By the end of the semester, I was the only woman.
There were a lot of also the young men who dropped out, but all the other
women dropped out of the physics class. I was the only one through all my
physics classes. All of them. Each and every one of them.

26

When I got to Columbia there had been another woman who had
graduated before me, so they were quite open and supportive. I have to say
that the faculty at Columbia were very, very supportive. I had a very positive
experience. The faculty in physics and math were supportive. In physics I
had some interesting experiences, but I was able to turn some of these
professors around.
Kiefer: Would you like to tell us about one of the experiences of making a difference
with a professor?
Kiremidjian: [00:30:08] I was taking the nuclear physics class at Queens College. Again, I
was the only female in the class. I would always sit in the front row wearing
my miniskirt, I dare say, not realizing how ridiculous that must have been.
[laughter] Looking back I would say that’s pretty daring, but I was wearing a
miniskirt and I would be sitting in the front row. The teacher made a few
derogatory remarks that pertained to the open houses that Columbia and
City College of New York and NYU was holding in two or three weeks.
NYU had invited the students to spend the night in the dormitory. He was
telling the students--the rest of the class of male students, of course--that
they can spend the night and then turned to me and said, “And you can
spend the night with the boys.”
I looked at him and just completely ignored him and didn’t say a
word. Didn’t say anything and just left class and just kept going to class.
About a week or so later, we had our midterm exam. I saw him coming
sheepishly after he had graded the exam and said, “There’s only one person
in the class who scored twenty points above everybody else.” That was me.

27

Kiremidjian: After that he wrote one of the nicest letters for me to go to Columbia.
Kiefer: That’s wonderful.
Kiremidjian: [00:31:48] That has been my philosophy--that I didn’t start engineering
because I was trying to change the world. I believed that I could be an
engineer. I just did my work. I did my job. I learned and I tried to do what
was expected of me.
Kiefer: If we could go back to Bulgaria a little bit. I believe in another conversation
you had said that math was taught differently, that there was a different
attitude towards math, and to conceptualizing math. Could you explain that a
little bit, what would make it different than what we learn in the U.S.?
Kiremidjian: [00:32:25] My experience in learning math in the U.S. at the high school level
relates primarily to my daughter taking math. Not just high school, but junior
high and elementary school. If I compare the way we were taught math at
elementary, junior and high school level to the way math was taught in the
school that my daughter went to, it seems in a lot of schools in the U.S. math
is taught by memorization. You memorize this. You memorize the answer.
The reason why I like math is because we were taught the concept. You
didn’t have to read thirty books. You didn’t have to memorize anything. You
understood it and then you could solve the problem. Once you understood
the concepts, then you could apply them. I remember things until today that
I’ve learned in elementary school, in high school, in college. Even today
when I’m teaching and I introduce or ask the class fundamental concepts
from calculus or from algebra, many of them don’t remember them because

28

they were never taught the principles behind them. They were told to
memorize them.
They were given the answer instead of the process, instead of
understanding the concept. To me, math has been beautiful because I can sit
down, I can understand the concept. If somebody explains to me the
concept, I can understand it and then I can use it in a variety of ways. That’s,
I think, the difference--if students are taught the concept rather than being
told to memorize. Beyond memorizing the multiplication tables, there’s
nothing really much to memorize in math. That’s the only place I can see
memorization as useful. The rest of the math concepts are concepts to be
understood--why certain things work the way they work. Once you
understand that, it stays with you forever.
Kiefer: Do you think that there’s right brain, left brain that predisposes somebody to
understanding math more?
Kiremidjian: [00:35:05] Possibly. We are all different and we do approach problems in a
different way. I mean my husband is a mathematician, and he really gets into
the concepts and then he’s yet at another level. When it comes to practical
things, he doesn’t think of certain things. Obviously, we are all different and
we all approach solving a problem in a different way. Indeed, some people
do wonderfully with literature and poetry and history, and I’m not that
person. Maybe I wasn’t taught that component the correct way. I don’t really
know. I’ve never investigated it enough to be able to tell you that.
Indeed, I think some people do approach math more easily,
understand the concepts more easily, but I do believe in early exposure and

29

accepting math for what it is rather than making it this mysterious subject
that is so difficult. I think math is being portrayed here as being so difficult
that a lot of the students are actually afraid to even try it. As soon as they’re
confronted with it, if there’s the first problem that they cannot solve, they
feel that they’re not gifted in that area. You don’t have to be gifted to try and
solve a problem. How do I say this? I really think that the right pedagogical
approach would be to allow the students to explore math and help them
along the way step by step. For the students that grasp math much more
quickly, they should certainly be challenged and moved forward.
For the students who feel that this is a big obstacle, they have a block
towards math, it is amazing to me how if you work with them and show
them simple problems--. There are a lot of people who have worked on this
in the United States. I see colleagues in the Math Department trying to
approach mathematics, and teaching from different points of view, and
they’ve been successful in bringing math to kids at all kinds of levels. Part of
the problem I think in the United States is that teachers are not trained
uniformly the same way. Different teachers are teaching math in different
ways and some of them are not as successful as others. I think if we look
around and find the techniques that have proven to be successful and apply
that much more uniformly across the different schools, we will see that math
is more successful with all levels of different types of students and we’ll be
able to bring and make math more understandable to these students.

30

Kiefer: If math were made understandable in the ways that you’ve indicated, do you
think that it would be more appealing to girls and women than it is right
now?
Kiremidjian: [00:39:04] I would think so. I think a lot of the young ladies are adept and
they are perfectly capable of doing extremely well in math. There has to be
that attitude from the very beginning that it’s perfectly normal to study math
and that they can be good in math. That’s number one. On one hand, I like
the idea that we are creating more opportunities for young women to
emphasize math. Sometimes that also can backfire because it’s pointing to
the women that, oh, women have a problem with math, and maybe some
women start doubting themselves at the first obstacle that they come across.
I don’t really know how you solve that problem.
If we can all accept that, yes, women can do math, and from Day
One we treat everyone the same and say, “Okay, you do the math the same
way as everybody else is doing it.” Not, “Oh, you’re a girl, we are going to try
to help you now because you need extra help with the math.” To me, that’s
somewhat defeating the purpose because it’s pointing to them that, “Oh, you
may have a problem.” The fact is that they probably don’t have a problem.
Just present the material to them, and if you see that there is a problem, then
reach out and help. That’s my philosophy.
Kiefer: That sounds great. I’d like to go back to Bulgaria for a minute. When you
were growing up it was the height of the Cold War.
Kiremidjian: [00:41:01] Yes.

31

Kiefer: Were you aware of anything, some effect of the Cold War? I mean you were
a child, and I don’t know how aware of politics you were. Was that brought
out? Was there a lot of propaganda?
Kiremidjian: [00:41:21] I think my first exposure to the dictatorial approach of
communism was first grade. I was in the Armenian school, and the Armenian
school was at the time right across from the Armenian Church. That year,
Easter Sunday, my parents went to Easter services and the whole family went
to Easter services. Of course, I went with my parents. Easter was always a
very big celebration at home. I still have such wonderful memories. The next
morning the principal of the school--even though it was an Armenian school
the principal had to be Bulgarian--called all the kids who had been to church
the day before and gave us a long lecture on how religion was used to exploit
the masses and that it is against the communist beliefs and the fundamental
beliefs of the party, and so on and so forth. I still remember that. We were
told that if we went to church again we will be expelled from school.
Kiefer: Oh.
Kiremidjian: [00:42:42] We went home and told our parents. Of course, they said, “Well, I
guess you guys are not going to church anymore.” Not only that, but they
were always afraid to speak in front of us about the propaganda that we were
given. There was a very famous movie. I don’t remember the name of the
movie, but I remember the story was about young boy whose parents were
not pro-communist and they were plotting something against the regime. He
was a hero because he went and told the authorities that his parents were
anti-communist and they were captured. He was praised as a big hero. Of

32

course, when we told our parents about that movie, and they said, “Okay.
Hm-mmm. Okay.” Not only that, but because my father was never a
member of any party or anything, and he was--. That was another story. They
had escaped from Turkey into Bulgaria.
My grandfather passed away when my father was very young, so my
father grew up an orphan. He had made himself. He had done extremely well
under the pre-communist regime. When the communists came, they
confiscated everything he had. He was particularly bitter because he said, “I
am the proletariat. You know, what is this nonsense?” He was very, very
bitter because he had worked so hard to make himself and yet they were
taking everything away from him, everything he had worked for. He was
working extra hours in the evening, and my mother started working as well.
We were always checking through the peephole who was coming after eight
o’clock to visit. We were always paranoid that they will come and take him
away again. I remember hearing them talk about the irony that the real
communists who fought--the partisans, who fought in the mountains--they
had lost all their privileges. The ruling class were those newcomers that had
taken advantage of the situation.
The people who truly believed in the Leninism and the Marxism and
this and that, they were the ones who were pushed to the side, and all their
dreams had disappeared because what was created was a new ruling class that
was much more dictatorial and oppressive than anything the country had
seen under the Tsar’s regime1. Actually, people really loved their king. That’s

1

[Kiremidjian’s note] Tsar Boris was the last ruler of Bulgaria before communism (1918-1943). Bulgaria was
33

at least what my parents said. I never experienced that, but that’s the way
they talked. Yes, I did experience that. It wasn’t just that. In junior high--this
was just before going to high school--Elvis Presley had become very popular.
During one of the student gatherings a student had brought in a recording of
Elvis Presley. Several of the kids danced to rock and roll. They were gathered
and sent to hard labor for two weeks because they dared dance capitalist
Western decadent dances.
Kiefer: Oh, my goodness. This was around what year?
Kiremidjian: [00:46:28] This must have been about 1963--1962, 1963, 1964. Somewhere
around that time. Those kids came back. They were never the same because I
don’t know if you can imagine what labor camps were like in Bulgaria. They
were excruciating. Hard labor means really hard labor.
Kiefer: They were there how long for this?
Kiremidjian: Two weeks.
Kiefer: Two weeks.
Kiremidjian: More than enough. More than enough to kill their spirit. They were never the
same.
Kiefer: Wow. What did your parents do for a living?
Kiremidjian: [00:47:02] My father was a jeweler/watch maker. My mother had a degree in
fashion design and was working as assistant designer in Bulgaria.
Kiefer: She had artistic talent.
Kiremidjian: Yes. She could draw. Actually there are artists in the family. My great uncle
was an artist in Turkey. Went to Romania after the 1915 massacres in Turkey.
under the Ottoman rule until 1879 and was a kingdom for the short period until 1946 when it became
communist.
34

That’s when my grandparents went to Bulgaria--after or during the massacres
in 1915--because that’s when they escaped from Turkey and went to
Bulgaria. My grandmother, my grandfather, and my father, who was nine
months old at the time, literally crossed the border from Turkey through
Greece to Bulgaria.
Kiefer: Did you have any brothers and sisters?
Kiremidjian: [00:48:03] I have a brother.
Kiefer: As you and your brother were raised, was there any message either overt or
covert from your parents, or even from the neighbors or your family in
general of what role that you should have or with the expectations for you as
a girl versus your brother?
Kiremidjian: [00:48:23] Of course. I was supposed to grow up to be--. How do I translate
that word? It’s a good housekeeper, you know. I was helping around the
house at a very early age with cleaning and ironing. I learned how to iron my
father’s shirt when I was probably about seven or eight years old. I was
always helping my mother, and I was always helping washing the dishes, and
setting the table, and picking up the table, and helping with the groceries.
Yes, I was not supposed to be able to do certain things because I was a girl.
But surprisingly enough, I have to say, my father and my brother were very
funny because they would always say, “Oh, yes. Excuse me. You’re a girl.
You can’t do that.” Whenever they would be fixing something mechanical or
fixing around the house, they always called me to help.
I was always there helping with changing the oil of the car or fixing
the carburetor or hammering the nails in the wall. Somehow, I as a girl, was

35

not supposed to do that, but when they needed help I was always there and
they always asked me to come and help. There was a lot of teasing in our
house in all directions. That was part of the teasing that went on between my
brother and me, “Oh, you’re a girl. You can’t do that.” Even now he says
that, but he says, “My sister, the engineer.” [laughter]
Kiefer: Okay. You’ve proved him wrong with this--.
Kiremidjian: [00:50:00] Yes. I was always very quiet and sort of, “I’ll show you.” [laugher]
“I’ll show you who can and who cannot do what.”
Kiefer: Okay. Moving fast forward, you’re now at Columbia and achieving a degree
in-Kiremidjian: Civil engineering.
Kiefer: --civil engineering. Okay.
Kiremidjian: I did finish my degree in two years. This was two years after the first three
years at Queens College. See, at the time I don’t believe they had that
program. It was called the 3-2 program where Queens College had an
agreement with several of the engineering schools in the New York City area
where Queens College provided the pre-engineering training, and then
students going through the pre-engineering program could apply to
Columbia, City College of New York, NYU--. I can’t remember which were
some of the other colleges. I did apply to all three. When I got to Columbia,
I had two more years to complete my bachelor’s degree.
The agreement is such that when you complete your bachelor’s
degree at one of these other institutions Queens College honored the courses
and gave you a bachelor’s of arts, in my case, physics. It could have been in

36

math, but I chose physics because I took more physics classes. I did get two
degrees at the end of the fifth year--a bachelor’s of science and civil
engineering from Columbia and the bachelor’s of arts in physics from
Queens College. A lot of people look at my CV and say, “Well, how come
you got two degrees in the same year.” Well, that was through a special
arrangement. You see, it’s just for me because I’m special. No, I’m kidding.
[laughter]
Kiefer: You are.
Kiremidjian: [00:51:47] [laughter] No, it was the program that was available to me. I took
full advantage of it, actually. I do believe that the three years I spent at
Queens were very special. Not only that I did get good training as a preengineer, but it gave me the opportunity to take a variety of classes in
humanities that I thought were phenomenal. I took a class in art history that
opened up a whole new horizon for me. It was Renaissance art. I absolutely
loved the class. I took a class in music. I did take some piano lessons when I
was very young but I didn’t pursue it very hard because we didn’t have a
piano at home and it became very difficult for me to go to the teacher’s
house all the time and practice there. I did grow up in a very musical family.
My parents loved music and music was on all the time. My mother
had a phenomenal operatic voice. She would sing and let her voice so that
you could hear four blocks down the street. I went to the opera for the first
time at the ripe age of eleven or twelve. I still remember, we saw Il Trovatore. I
remember my very first opera. I loved opera as a result. We went to a
number of operettas. I grew up in a musical family, but I’d never had formal

37

classes in music and history of music and the story of the various composers.
I took a class in music at Queens College and went through the entire
history, from very early through Baroque, through the Renaissance period,
through the romantic period, and modern. I loved it.
It was a tremendous part of my education I felt. My extra English classes
were in poetry, and as a result I still love poetry. I can’t say I like reading
Macbeth. [laughter] It’s bringing terrible memories to me. [laughter] Bringing
back horrible memories.
Kiefer: Did you speak other languages besides English and Bulgarian?
Kiremidjian: [00:54:19] At home we spoke Armenian. I grew up with Armenian and
Bulgarian. Early on my parents sent me to a French kindergarten, so I did
learn French very young. Then I took more French in college as one of the
foreign languages that I had to take. Russian was mandatory starting fifth
grade, so from fifth grade on I studied Russian. I still can understand and I
can say a few things, but I’ve forgotten. It’s hard for me to speak. When I
went to Moscow, quite a bit of it came back. We have a lot of Russians
around now. I can hear them talking and I can understand what they’re
saying. So those were some of the languages that I grew up with and I was
exposed to.
Kiefer: You grew up in Sofia. Right?
Kiremidjian: Yes. Sofia, Bulgaria. Right.
Kiefer: That’s the capital.
Kiremidjian: Yes.

38

Kiefer: Okay. Now, you’re ready for grad school because you were encouraged to go
on to grad school, or were you encouraged to just stop out and go to work?
Kiremidjian: [00:55:28] I didn’t know exactly what I was going to do. I knew I was going
to get my bachelor’s and work as an engineer. In fact, I did work one
summer for an engineering company in New York City. I don’t know if they
still exist or not. They were a smaller company. Then during my first year at
Columbia I met someone that I fell in love with, who fell in love with me as
well, who was a student at Columbia. He was finishing his PhD in
mathematics in complex variables and we started dating.
I think the fact that he was doing his PhD had an influence on me
that I wanted to pursue a graduate degree. Not necessarily a PhD, but
probably a master’s degree. During my senior year, I decided that I will stay
at Columbia and I would apply to Columbia to get a master’s degree. The
faculty were very encouraging. Professor Shinozuka [Masanobu Shinozuka]
and Professor Mario Salvadori, who was a very famous architect engineer in
New York at the time. He has written numerous books that are still being
used. Both of them had a strong influence on my decision to pursue a
graduate degree. When I applied, I also received the Freudenthal Fellowship
from Columbia to do graduate studies. It’s a very competitive, very
prestigious fellowship, which I was really honored to receive. I got married in
June.
Kiefer: Your husband’s name is--?
Kiremidjian: [00:57:24] Garo Kiremidjian. He had finished his PhD the year before and
was teaching at Stony Brook at the time. We got married after I graduated.

39

We had decided we were going to wait until I finished my bachelor’s. We
dated for two years and then were engaged for about a year and a half or so
and then got married in June after my graduation. One weekend was
graduation, two weekends later was our wedding. Or maybe a weekend later
was our wedding. I can’t remember. I remember when our wedding was, I
just don’t remember if the distance between graduation and our wedding was
one or two weeks. Whatever.
We went on our honeymoon to Europe. While we were in Europe,
he received an offer from Stanford to come and teach as an assistant
professor for three years. I said, “Hmmm. So what do I do?” I’d heard of the
program at Stanford because one of my classmates at Columbia had praised
it so much and was applying to come to Stanford. I said, “Hmmm. Stanford,
interesting.” While we were traveling in Europe, I applied to Stanford. I was
accepted but because I was applying so late, I did not receive any funding,
which was going to create a little bit of a problem for a young couple coming
to a new place. You know, we started with zero in our bank accounts. He
came from an immigrant family. Incidentally, he was born in the same city,
Sofia, Bulgaria.
Kiefer: Oh, really?
Kiremidjian: [00:59:12] They immigrated about the same time. But we didn’t know each
other until five years after we had been in the United States. We met at a
friend’s party. At a mutual acquaintance’s party, I should say. We shared a lot
of history and a lot of interests, and a love for math and science, and love for
music, classical music in particular, and love for travel. We traveled for two

40

and a half months on our honeymoon in Europe. I don’t know of too many
people who have done that. At the time it was affordable. [laughter]
Kiefer: Yes.
Kiremidjian: It was very affordable. We look back and say, “How did we do that?” So if I
tell you how much it cost, you can’t even buy an airline ticket today for that.
[laughter]
Kiefer: That’s true.
Kiremidjian: [01:00:06] So we came to Stanford at the end of the summer. He was
teaching in the Math Department and I started my graduate studies. Stanford
hadn’t seen a woman in civil engineering before. I was, again, the only
woman. I had some faculty who didn’t quite understand what are women
doing, and would come to class and say, “What do women want? Now they
want to be engineers?”
Kiefer: Now, this was the time of the women’s movement.
Kiremidjian: [01:00:44] Yes. That’s right. That’s right. The women’s liberation movement
was really starting up. Actually, it was peaking at that point, 1972. It was
really peaking at that point. This was the SDS [Students for a Democratic
Society] movement. It was the end of the Vietnam War. It was a very
tumultuous time. I was at Columbia when all the Students for Democratic
Society were rioting. That was actually a big shock to me, having grown up in
Bulgaria. People rioting against the government? It’s unheard of. How could
they possibly? Aren’t they afraid they’re going to be thrown in jail and sent to
hard labor? [laughter] It was a real eye-opener as to what freedom meant. I
got to appreciate what freedom really meant is that people had the right to

41

express their opinion. I mean I still didn’t dare do that, but I was appreciative
that everybody else could say what they really felt and thought.
So, yes, I came to Stanford. I was going to do primarily master’s, and
I wasn’t sure whether I was going to stay for a PhD. By the end of the
master’s year, I pretty much decided that I will stay on to do a PhD. I was
very fortunate, I have to say, that Professor Shah--.
Kiefer: Haresh Shah? [Haresh C. Shah, Obyashi Professor in the School of
Engineering, Emeritus]
Kiremidjian: [01:02:20] Haresh Shah, right, took me under his wing and said, “Okay, let’s
try it for the next year. You can be working on some projects.” He was
extremely active. Just as active as he is now. [laughter] Sometimes we call him
the Energizer Bunny [laughter], he’s got so much energy, even until today.
He was even more energetic at the time. It was during the second year after
my master’s degree that I started working with him. The earthquake in
Managua, Nicaragua had occurred. There was no earthquake engineering
program at the time. It was a more traditional structural engineering program
then. Haresh had gone to look at the damage after the 1971 San Fernando
earthquake, the year before I came to Stanford.
[01:03:18] Then 1973 was the earthquake in Managua, Nicaragua.2 He
went, first by himself, to Managua, and when he came back, he had a project
to study the damage and to do hazard mapping. I became part of the team
that studied and developed the seismic hazard map for Nicaragua. I got very
involved in the process and got very interested in the earthquake problem.
[Kiremidjian’s note] The earthquake actually occurred on Dec. 23, 1972, but we did not start working on the
project until 1973.
2

42

Actually it must have been 1974 because it was after our first version of the
map was ready. There were three of us that went to Managua, Nicaragua to
present our results.
Then I had the opportunity to actually see the devastation from the
earthquake. It really impressed on me what an earthquake can do to beautiful
structures that we build and design. It created a purpose for me--that I would
study earthquakes and the effect of earthquakes on buildings. I really could
see the reason why I should be working on that problem. It was a very
serious problem where not only buildings were destroyed but lives were lost
and the economy was disrupted. That’s what I wanted to do is study
earthquakes.
[01:05:07] It was also interesting that it was a very fresh area of study,
meaning that there wasn’t much known. Whenever you start working on a
problem that not much is known about, there are a lot of opportunities to
solve problems, to make contributions. It was also the atmosphere around
this. Haresh has a very infectious personality, as you, yourself know. He had
us all excited about working on the problem. He and Jim Gere [James M.
Gere] also were working on establishing an earthquake engineering program
at Stanford. They were working with some of the leaders, like John Blume,
who was known for his contributions at the time to earthquake engineering.
John, being a graduate of the Stanford program with three degrees, had a
very soft spot for Stanford and wanted to establish an earthquake center at
Stanford.

43

Kiefer: Okay. At this point, why don’t we take a quick break? Then we’ll come back
and hear more about your work with the Blume Center, and how times
changed through the 1970s, 1980s and beyond in terms of women being in
engineering. Then, of course, our very own earthquake, the Loma Prieta, and
your role in that.
Kiremidjian: Okay. [01:06:39]

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

MAY 20, 2016

PART:

2 OF 2

Kiefer: This is Joyce Kiefer, and I’m resuming the interview with Anne Kiremidjian.
Professor Kiremidjian, I wanted to ask you more about your being a grad
student. You’re working towards your PhD and your advisor is Haresh Shah.
Now, how would you say Professor Shah was in terms of your being this
woman in the department who’s very much a singular person? Was he
encouraging? Did he seem to work from a difference between you and male
colleagues? How did that work out?
Kiremidjian: [00:01:08] Looking back, I think I was very fortunate that he was very open
to having women work with him. From the very start he treated me pretty
much the same way as he treated all the other students. The expectations
were the same, that I would do just as much work as anybody else. I guess I
had demonstrated that I’m capable, that he took me on. I have to say I’m
quite grateful that he had an open mind. Thinking about the other faculty, if
he had not taken me on, I’m not sure I could have worked with anyone else
within the department. Maybe. I don’t know. It seemed very natural that I
work with him.

45

As you know Haresh, he’s a very open and very natural, very warm
person. He was very professional about the whole thing. He said I’m one of
the students. He’s a professor. You’re working on a project. From there on,
there weren’t any questions. The issue about the fact that I was the only
woman never came up, was never questioned, was never brought up at any
particular time. I felt that I’m doing my work and as long as I do my work
things would be fine. And they were. [00:02:48]
Was he encouraging? He was just as encouraging with me as he was
with everybody else. He had high expectations for everyone. If we had to
work through the night to finish a project, that’s what we had to do. It didn’t
matter whether you were one of the boys or one of the girls. If you had to
get things done, you had to get things done. He was very inspiring in many
ways because he always had a lot of different ideas of what he wanted to do,
and he was always such a busy individual, always running around. He always
had things going. What was really nice was that he involved us in just about
all his projects. I have to say because of him I did get to travel to so many
places. [00:03:43]
He opened all these opportunities for all of us, and I was always
included. There may have been occasions where he preferred that he take the
boys along, but most of the time I was included in any gatherings. That was
the thing. Any gatherings at his house, I was always included. We were always
welcomed to travels around the world--I was included. I didn’t feel that there
was any difference between the way he treated me and he treated some of the
other students.

46

Kiefer: What were the attitudes of the other students towards you?
Kiremidjian: [00:04:24] I don’t know. I guess I was so focused on what I was doing that I
really didn’t pay attention to that, I have to say honestly. If I think back, I
don’t know if they had a problem. Frankly, that wasn’t my problem, that was
their problem if they had a problem. My objective was to get my work done,
to excel in what I was doing, and to get my degree and move on with my
career and with my life. If they had a problem with that then I didn’t engage
myself in that. It was their problem. I really didn’t care. That has been my
attitude all along. If somebody decided to make it a problem for me, then I
would react. If they had a problem dealing with it, then I just let them resolve
it themselves.
Kiefer: Once you got your PhD did you, at that point, decide you wanted to
continue to teach at a university, or go into industry?
Kiremidjian: [00:05:32] I did try working for industry but in the back of my mind I had
pretty much decided to join a university towards the end of my PhD. There
were not too many positions available. As it is today, the academic positions
are very limited. I did work for John Blume in San Francisco. I was really
privileged actually to work with John Blume. I was working on a very
exciting project. They had just found a brand new fault near Diablo Canyon
Nuclear Power Plant, the Hosgri fault that was not known to exist when they
designed and built the plant originally. John Blume’s company was hired by
PG&E [Pacific Gas & Electric Company] to investigate the effects of the
Hosgri fault on the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant.

47

I was charged with developing a model for earthquakes that may
occur on the fault and the estimation of the seismic waves that would arrive
at the power plant. The model was later published in the Structural Engineering
Journal with John Blume. It was a very interesting project and a very
meaningful project. I didn’t participate in the hearings with NRC [Nuclear
Regulatory Commission] but I heard from other colleagues that they were
well accepted and the results that we had generated were well accepted.
[00:07:10]
It gave me an opportunity to observe Dr. Blume in action. He was an
incredible character. Very smart. The gentleman was a real phenomenal
brain. Very quick. Quick wit, quick action. He used to think of answers right
away and he grasped concepts very quickly. I could see him in meetings
where people would challenge, and he would challenge back in a very calm
and deliberate way. I could only wish I could approach colleagues in the
same way that he did. He was very effective. Very, very effective. We did
become good friends.
I had met John several years before that. It was during the
establishment of the John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering Center. He had
received all his degrees, his bachelor’s, master’s, engineer’s degree, and many
years later a PhD from the program, the civil engineering and structural
engineering at Stanford. He had a very soft spot in his heart for the Civil
Engineering Department and structural engineering at Stanford, and was very
excited when Haresh and Jim Gere [James M. Gere] decided to establish an
earthquake engineering center. Through his generous donation, the center

48

was endowed and is still thriving until today. I was still a graduate student. I
remember the preparations around the inauguration of the center.
We were preparing all the exhibits and preparing various
demonstrations, and I was an integral part of that whole group of people
who were intimately involved with all these preparations. It was an incredible
event. It was a very impressive event. They had all the big names not just
from around the United States but around the world that came, gave
presentations and participated in the inauguration of the Blume Center. We
have pictures, of course, in the Blume Center of the inauguration. It was a
very important event that will stay in my memory. Yes.
Kiefer: Do you recall what year that was?
Kiremidjian: [00:10:03] It was the year before I graduated with my PhD. [1974]
Kiefer: Then you got your PhD, worked for John Blume in San Francisco.
Kiremidjian: Right.
Kiefer: Then at what point did you decide that you wanted to teach?
Kiremidjian: [00:10:16] There were two opportunities for faculty positions, one here at
Stanford and one at Berkeley. I interviewed both places and came to
Stanford. Berkeley did not make me an offer. I should make that clear.
[laughter] I’d already decided to come to Stanford and join the faculty in
1978 and have been on the faculty since then3.
Kiefer: Now, at the time when you joined the faculty, were there any more women
on the faculty in the School of Engineering itself?

[Kiremidjian’s note] “Actually, I interviewed three schools. In addition to Stanford and Berkeley I also
interviewed at the University of Illinois, Chicago and was made an offer, which I turned down.”
3

49

Kiremidjian: [00:10:50] There was another lady in transportation engineering who was part
of the faculty. Oh, she may have come later, Lyna Wiggins. There was a
young woman in Environmental Engineering, Lily Young, who was also part
of the faculty in Civil Engineering. Neither one of them made tenure. I was
the first one to go through the tenure process and make tenure.
Kiefer: Do you feel that in that process there were any problems that you had that
the men didn’t in terms of extra challenges?
Kiremidjian: [00:11:42] My biggest challenge was that once we decided to stay in the Bay
Area and I joined Stanford, we decided to finally have a family. That was
almost seven or so years after we had been married. No, six years after we
had been married. It was not until 1980 when I actually was coming up for
reappointment. I decided that, oh, it’s not a good time to try anymore.
[laughter] It wasn’t even a month after we decided it’s not a good time to try
that I was pregnant. [laughter]
The challenge was that I was coming up for reappointment and I was
pregnant and dealing with issues of pregnancy, and also dealing with teaching
classes and doing research and all the things that faculty do. You know, I’m
having a household and so on and so forth, and my husband was working
long hours and traveling quite a bit to Washington and back. He had joined a
company at that point. He had joined TRW in 1978.
Yes, the challenge was acceptance by some of the faculty that I was
having a child and that I was actually dedicated to staying on the faculty. I did
have some faculty ask whether I’m going to stay home now that I have a
child. I assured them that I am coming back. Yes. When it came time for

50

tenure though, I made sure that I dotted all the I’s and crossed all the T’s and
that everything was in perfect order. I’m told by some of my colleagues that
my papers flew through the system without a hitch. That’s what I was told. I
don’t know.
Kiefer: Wonderful.
Kiremidjian: [00:13:55] I don’t know what transpired. I don’t know the details. I know I
met all the requirements. I’d made sure I had a discussion at the time with
Perry McCarty who was chair of the department and I remember sitting after
my reappointment and going over the points of what it would take to
become a tenured associate professor at Stanford. He explained what the
criteria are, and I made sure for the next three years to follow them. It was
not easy to raise a child. None of our family was nearby. All of our family are
back in New York. It’s hard when you get up in the morning and you have to
teach a class at 8:00 a.m. and there is no excuse just because I have a child. I
certainly was expected to teach a class at 8:00 a.m. I’d find some of my
younger female colleagues had expectations that because they have a child
they cannot teach early classes. I’d chuckle and say, “Wow.” I mean it’s really
nice if you can get that. All the power to you. Somehow I wouldn’t even dare
to say, “Oh, can I have a class later in the day because I’m up all night
nursing.” [laughter]
You get up in the morning, you’re ready to go to class and teach, and
next thing you know your child is sick. Who do you find? She was in daycare
from age seven months on. There were a lot of challenges with raising a child
and trying to become a tenured faculty and teaching regular classes. I had

51

three months, not even quite full three months; I had the fall quarter off. She
[Seta] was born October 20th and I came back teaching in January. Also, in
our field we travel a lot. You know, we have conferences around the world.
She grew up with mom going here, going there. [laughter] We used to joke
that she was allergic to the idea of me going to Japan because every time I
went to Japan she got sick.
Kiefer: I see. Psychological maybe?
Kiremidjian: [00:16:23] Right. Yes. [laughter] It was not until I took her to Japan with me
that she stopped getting sick whenever I went to Japan. [laughter]
Kiefer: Okay. Did you take her along very much?
Kiremidjian: [00:16:35] Oh, a lot. A lot. She traveled quite a bit because of the trips that
we were taking that related either to my work or to my husband’s work. As a
result, she loves traveling around the world. It’s not a big deal for her to hop
on the plane and go to London or go to Paris because that’s what we did. I’d
have a conference halfway around the world, I would hop, and if I could
bring her along, I would bring her along. I was known among my colleagues
for bringing my child to conferences and bringing her to board meetings.
Kiefer: Great.
Kiremidjian: [00:17:13] I remembered until today. I was serving on the board of directors
of a group called California Universities for Research in Earthquake
Engineering and I was elected to be on the board. We had a meeting
scheduled for Monday and I failed to see that that particular Monday when
the board meeting was scheduled happened to be teacher conferences when
the students got to stay home. What was I supposed to do? Instead of

52

finding someone to take care of her, I said, “Okay. You’re coming with me.”
She must have been six years old, seven, something like this.
I had miles on United and I got her a free ticket, flew down to L.A.,
the two of us. She was very nice and sat and occupied herself reading and
drawing through the meeting. They were all impressed. All my colleagues
were impressed as to how well behaved she is. Her reward was that when the
meeting finished at three o’clock, an hour earlier than it was supposed to, the
two of us hopped in a rental car and went to Disneyland. [laughter]
Kiefer: Wonderful. That’s wonderful.
Kiremidjian: [00:18:34] And spent the rest of the day and evening until we could catch the
last flight out. At that time, you could just literally get to the airport ten
minutes before flight and make it without a problem. We flew back that night
and she still remembers that wonderful experience.
Kiefer: It sounds like you were very creative in working around what could be real
huge challenges.
Kiremidjian: [00:19:02] They were just necessities and you deal with them as they come
along. That was one way I could deal with them. She was known to come to
the annual meeting of the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, the
EERI, and would run up and down during break and go up to the podium
and talk on the microphone because she thought it was so much fun to talk
on the microphone. I was recently at the same meeting in San Francisco and
people reminded me, “So how is your little girl?”
I said, “Well, my little girl is about this little.” [laughter]
Kiefer: What is Seta doing now?

53

Kiremidjian: [00:19:40] She is a director at Merrill Lynch in Bank of America in New York
City. Right.
Kiefer: Okay. Let’s take you back to the Blume Center. I understand that you were
co-director.
Kiremidjian: Right.
Kiefer: Then eventually director.
Kiremidjian: Yes.
Kiefer: During your leadership what were some of the accomplishments that
occurred then?
Kiremidjian: [00:20:07] The first challenge was Loma Prieta earthquake.
Kiefer: Maybe we should talk about the timeframe here. It looks like you were codirector in 1987 to 1994.
Kiremidjian: Yes.
Kiefer: That would definitely cover Loma Prieta. Then actual director from 1995 to
2002.
Kiremidjian: Thank you for refreshing my memory. Right.
Kiefer: Before the earthquake, what kind of research were you doing?
Kiremidjian: [00:20:55] Yes. As part of my dissertation, I developed the first probabilistic
seismic hazard map for California. In fact, when I finished my probabilistic
seismic hazard map for California, USGS [United States Geological Survey]
had developed their deterministic hazard map. The difference is that when
you’re doing probabilistic hazard mapping we include the uncertainty of
where the earthquake would occur on the fault because we don’t know ahead
of time where it will occur. We include the uncertainty on the size of the

54

event, what magnitude it’s going to be, the frequency of occurrences, all of
these components. Then we incorporate the contribution of all the faults that
might rupture, all the earthquakes on all possible locations.
[00:21:49] In deterministic hazard mapping, earthquake mapping is
you assume just specific events and you take the contribution of only those
specific events. That’s what USGS had done is to develop a ground motion
map of California at the time when I had already developed a probabilistic
hazard map. When I presented it at a seminar in USGS, they were not happy
that I was presenting something that was different from what they’d done. I
was told that I could go to Las Vegas with my probabilities. [laughter] Well,
ironically, one of the main products of USGS today is to develop
probabilistic seismic hazard maps, not just of California but of the entire
United States. These maps are essential for seismic design everywhere in the
United States. They update those every year. You know, and it took them
several years until they actually embraced that technology.
Then we started looking at time dependent occurrences of events
because in these models we assume that even large events can occur at any
time. We didn’t take into consideration the fact that a larger earthquake
requires considerable amount of time for the energy along the fault to be
accumulated to be able to generate a large earthquake.
After the 1906 earthquake you could not have had another 1906 type
earthquake within a day or two. It takes more than 250 years to accumulate
the energy to generate a similar size event. It doesn’t mean that you cannot
have smaller earthquakes in the same location where the 1906 earthquake

55

occurred, but to generate the same size event, you need a certain length of
fault and depth of fault and time to accumulate the energy and accumulate
the stress along the fault to be able to generate such a large event. We were
not taking that into consideration.
[00:24:16] We developed some of the first models that took into
consideration the time dependence of earthquake occurrences with my very
first PhD student who was also a female. I made sure my very first female
student, Thalia Anagnos, who is currently senior provost at San Jose State, by
the way. [laughter]
Kiefer: My alma mater.
Kiremidjian: [00:24:44] Yes. We developed the first time dependent models for earthquake
occurrences. I was then involved in some projects with the Applied
Technology Counsel on looking at risk assessment models where we
developed damage functions for different types of structures that enabled
you to very rapidly get an estimate of what is the degree of damage at the site
of your building due to an earthquake. I was always involved with the Blume
Center, Haresh and Jim Gere, who were co-directors. Then Helmut and Jim
Gere were co-directors.
Kiefer: Helmut Krawinkler.
Kiremidjian: [00:25:34] Helmut Krawinkler who passed away, unfortunately, a couple of
years ago. When Jim Gere decided to step aside, I was asked to become the
co-director of the Blume Center. I have to say, Helmut in many ways was
very open even though he didn’t believe women can be engineers [laughter]
and said so outright. [laughter]

56

Kiefer: Okay.
Kiremidjian: [00:26:02] He always came by and discussed any issues and problems and
decisions that had to be made around the Blume Center. We organized our
annual meetings or biannual meetings and had visitors from around the
world. The Blume Center has always been a focal point for research in
earthquake engineering. Then as a result we’ve had collaborations with Japan,
with China, with Europe, and we’ve had visitors from all over the world all
the time until today. Of course, that’s made life very exciting, very interesting.
1989 was the other big challenge.
Kiefer: Yes.
Kiremidjian: [00:26:55] The Loma Prieta earthquake. I was co-director with Helmut. I was
on my way to pick up my daughter Seta from elementary school. I was on my
way driving on Foothill Expressway. I had stopped at El Monte, waiting to
make a left turn to go pick her up. I was on the left turn lane and then I felt
this strong jolt. I said, “Ah. Who hit me from behind?” I turned back to see
who was behind me and I saw that there was a gap between my car and the
car behind me. There was a couple of feet. This is really strange. Why did my
car jump like that?
As I’m going through that thought process, I felt another jolt, and
then I saw the trees start shaking violently and the light overhanging in the
middle of the street started shaking violently. I said, “Whoa. This is a strong
wind.” Still not realizing that it was an earthquake, I pulled my window down
and there was not even a breeze. Then it finally dawned on me. I said, “Wow.
This was a big earthquake.” Just as I’m thinking that, there’s another

57

aftershock. At that point what was really interesting to see was there were
three rows of cars stopped across from us, and there were the three rows of
cars on my side. I could literally see the cars go up and down and up and
down and across as the wave was coming across. It was absolutely
fascinating.
Of course, I went, picked up my daughter. Everybody was in panic.
She was in tears. The chimney had fallen and just missed the French teacher;
much to the disappointment of the students I was told. [laughter]
Kiefer: Okay. [laughter]
Kiremidjian: [00:29:09] That was the only damage that the school had. Then I went home.
Our china cabinet had fallen down. It was not attached to the wall, of course.
We didn’t really have any other damage. I picked up my camera and went and
started taking pictures of the overpass that’s across the street from us, and
the 280 had significant cracks in the base of the column. Then my husband
came home and I went back to Stanford. We had to regroup and it was
Haresh and Helmut and I and Jim Gere and the facilities managers, the
architect, the university architect. We had to see which buildings were
damaged, which buildings were not damaged. All of us participated in the
inspection of buildings the next day and the day after.
At the time, our students had just gone through the training of what
we call rapid visual screening. It’s a training that the Applied Technology
Council at the time, together with the Structural Engineers Association in
San Francisco, was offering to train students in inspecting buildings for
cracks and other signs of damage, and then rating the level of damage of the

58

structure. Moreover, we had two students in the class that were from the
army. They were both West Point graduates. They immediately organized all
the students.
Kiefer: Wonderful.
Kiremidjian: [00:31:00] Jim Alty and John Luce. I still remember and keep in touch with
John Luce. They were great. They organized all the students and their
military training came in. It was very obvious. All the students were paired
with facility representatives, and we all spent the next two days going from
one building to the next building to the next. We focused first on all the large
auditoria. There were people who went to the dormitories. We had to figure
out which buildings were usable, which buildings had to be closed down.
Then President Don Kennedy [Donald Kennedy] was very anxious to be
able to tell the students when we can reopen and resume classes.
If you remember, we resumed classes within two days after the
earthquake. There was considerable number of buildings that had to be
closed down, like the Geology Corner and the museum had to be closed, the
church had to be closed. Memorial Church had quite a bit of damage. I have
somewhere pictures in Memorial Church climbing over the parapets and
walking over--. It was a very, very interesting experience when we were
directly involved in that.
Kiefer: Did you work with FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency]?
Kiremidjian: [00:32:31] We didn’t directly work with FEMA. The university
representatives worked with FEMA. We worked with the university reps, as I
said, with the university architect and facilities managers. I think Haresh may

59

have been involved with the FEMA meetings. I was not. If anybody was, he
probably was. Also, we were inundated by visitors, by groups trying to come
and see what the damage was because that’s what we do, you know,
whenever there’s been an earthquake. I went to Guatemala in 1976, and I
went to El Salvador in 1983, and I’ve traveled to earthquakes all over the
place, and Northridge, California, in 1986, and Armenia in 1988 and 1989,
and so on and so forth. That’s what we do.
We go to the earthquake-stricken area and we look at the damage and
try to learn. People were trying to do the same. Because we had a significant
amount of damage on campus, all the groups that went to San Francisco also
wanted to come to Stanford. A lot of them expected reciprocity because we
had gone to see them. I remember being so exhausted running from class to
a meeting with group from Finland, group from Germany, group from
Japan, second group from Japan, third group from Japan, group from China,
group from I don’t know where, group from Germany, and you name it. We
were giving briefings to all the groups. We were trying to alternate with
Helmut. He would meet with one and I would meet another. Even then it
was exhausting. I don’t remember being so tired in my life as I was when we
had the Loma Prieta earthquake.
It was shortly after that that the chair asked if I would be the sole
director of the Blume Center in 1995. The process of rebuilding or restrengthening the Blume Center had started while Helmut and I were codirectors, but I saw the reconstruction when I was the sole director and had
to make a lot of the decisions and work with the redesign of the Blume

60

Center and some of the fundraising that had to take place. It was very, very
rewarding to see the Blume Center reopen.
John Blume had aged quite a bit at that point and he was fighting
Parkinson’s and he didn’t want to go anywhere. One Sunday I convinced his
wife Jene to bring him over so I could show him what the Blume Center
looked like when it was renovated. He was beaming when he saw what the
Blume Center was like after renovation with the new spaces and areas that
have become much more functional and the office locations and the
computer labs and some of the original lab but strengthened and cleaned up
and refurbished. I remember writing a proposal to get funding to replace
some of the pumps and actuators on the shake table. He was very, very
happy. It was probably the last time he came to visit the Blume Center. We
had an official reopening and he could not come, but his wife Jene came and
she was very happy to see what was done.
Kiefer: Seems ironic that the earthquake center would be damaged by an earthquake.
[laughter]
Kiremidjian: [00:37:12] Yes. We had to keep reminding the university that we need to
strengthen it soon because if we have another earthquake, we were very close
to getting severely damaged. If Loma Prieta had lasted longer than the fifteen
seconds that we experienced, we probably would have seen a lot more
damage to the Blume Center.
Kiefer: The Richter scale of that earthquake was--?
Kiremidjian: [00:37:35] 6.9.
Kiefer: 6.9.

61

Kiremidjian: [00:37:37] On the moment magnitude scale, which is the new scale that we
use. Up to about 6.5 the two scales are identical, the Richter and the
moment. The Richter scale has some problems when you get to the high
values of 7, 7.5. So 6.9 on the moment magnitude is what we call it now.
Kiefer: In 1995 you developed a wireless sensor.
Kiremidjian: [00:38:09] Actually, it started in 1991. It was a very interesting development,
actually, the way the whole thing came about. It was couple years after the
Loma Prieta earthquake that Jim Gibbons [James Gibbons], dean of the
School of Engineering, held a luncheon for the few women in the School of
Engineering. I remember there were only six of us or so. There may have
been more but not everyone can make it to those luncheons as you know.
During that luncheon, I was sitting across the table from a young lady from
Electrical Engineering, Professor Teresa Meng. Of course, the subject of the
Loma Prieta was very fresh in everybody’s mind and came up, especially
when I said I was working in earthquake engineering. She proceeded to
chastise me and said, “What’s wrong with you civil engineers and structural
engineers? There’s so many buildings that people don’t know what is the
damage and where is the damage. So how come you don’t know?”
I said, “Well, we probably could know if we had better sensors and
more sensors. But we don’t.” I explained to her that one of the problems was
that the accelerometers that we install on buildings were boxes this big. They
were very expensive. They were $15,000 to $20,000 each. We’re talking 1991
money.

62

Yes, there were maybe about a hundred buildings in the Bay Area
that were instrumented, maybe. I used to serve on the Strong Motion
Instrumentation Committee for the State of California, so we were making
those decisions. To instrument a single building costs $100,000 at the time.
Anyway, I was explaining all that to her, what the limitations are. And
because they’re so expensive you can put only a few sensors on a building.
And when you put only a few sensors, they don’t give you enough
information to be able to say what is the damage, where is the damage, how
big is the damage. We started talking. She was working on miniature robotic
cameras at the time where the camera can travel around and take pictures.
We tried to explore that idea.
That would have been helpful, except that most of the damage in
buildings is hidden behind walls. And the camera needs light and needs to be
able to travel around and it’s not always easy for a camera for a little robot to
be traveling between the walls where you have all kinds of obstacles along
the way. That idea we scrapped very quickly. But wireless technology was
becoming very prominent. I told her, “In addition to being very big, the
current sensors require that cables be run up and down the building. For a
new building, it’s not as difficult to install cables during construction. But in
existing buildings, running cables up and down is a very, very expensive
process. If you spend $100,000 on instrumentation, more than 30 percent of
that money goes to the cabling part. But if we could do it wirelessly, we
eliminate the problem of cabling.” She got very excited, and I got very
excited, and we had several meetings.

63

[00:41:57] One of my PhD students at the time, Erik Straser, got also
very excited. He took classes from Tom Kenny and Ed Carryer [J. Edward
Carryer] in mechanical engineering. Those were the classes in mechatronics
that taught students how to design different gadgets, and they develop
prototypes in the class and had them running, and one type of the gadgets
they designed was wireless sensors. Of course, the biggest problem was
getting funding to support this effort. We wrote one proposal; I believe it
was to NASA. It got turned down. We wrote another proposal, it got turned
down. Finally we wrote a proposal to NSF and it got funded. With the
funding from NSF, Teresa and Erik and I [went to work], with some input
also from Tom Kenny and Ed Carryer. Ed in particular was working very
closely with Erik Straser, and Teresa was very helpful with the wireless
technology, so much so that she started a company on wireless sensors. What
was it? The 802.11b, I believe, wireless chip was developed through her
company. I’m pretty sure that’s what it was. It was a new wireless chip that
they developed.
Anyway, coming back to what we were doing: We designed the very
first wireless structural monitoring accelerometer that can be installed in a
bridge. We built five of those in our lab. Erik befriended one of the structural
engineers at Los Alamos--actually he [Charles Farrar] is both a structural and
mechanical engineer at Los Alamos National Labs--who was doing a lot of
testing of bridges using conventional accelerometers.
They were very interested in the idea of the wireless accelerometer,
and so they decided to do a test on the Alamosa Canyon Bridge, which was

64

given to them. It was a bridge that was decommissioned basically. Instead of
taking it down, Los Alamos was using it for testing. We took our sensors to
the Alamosa Canyon Bridge in New Mexico. Erik Straser and Chuck Farrar
[Charles Farrar] went to Alamosa Canyon. We had five of our sensors. They
had three or four of theirs. They installed their system with all the cables. We
installed our sensors--all we had to do is stick them on the bridge itself. I
should mention that it took Erik half an hour to put on our sensors. It took
them seven or eight hours to run the cable, check the cables, reinstall the
cables and make sure the system was running. It was not until the next day
that they actually did the testing. The testing involved running a truck across
the bridge back and forth several times and taking vibration measurements
from the bridge. We came back and looked at the results from their test and
results of our test. The match was incredibly close.
We had succeeded in proving that our sensors operate wirelessly.
First of all they collect the data. Actually, I can show you. This is the very
first wireless sensor that we did. I know it looks monstrous in today’s
standards, but this was completed in 1994, tested in 1995. Of course, when
you do prototype, you don’t worry about size. You try to incorporate as
many things as possible. Many of the combination of chips have now been
reduced to a single chip. You can take this whole assembly and reduce it to
something smaller than just this top board. We have developed sensors now
that have a lot more functionality than this one had, but it’s as big as this top
board basically.

65

Yes. This is my little antique [laughter] that I keep in my office
collecting dust, I see. See, this is like a mother patting --. [laugher] Yes. Yes.
Then actually Stanford applied for a patent and we do have the patent on
wireless structural monitoring instrumentation that we’ve held for some time
now.
Kiefer: Are you able to sell these commercially?
Kiremidjian: [00:47:31] No because we have not developed a commercial product. We
attempted to do it but--. I think the civil engineering industry requires a long
adoption period and I don’t have the stamina [laughter] for the long adoption
cycle, nor do investors have the taste and the stamina for long adoption
cycles. I’m letting our students and the students of our students develop
commercial grade sensors. At some point sometime in the next twenty to
thirty years, they will become commonplace.
Kiefer: Speaking of students, how would you describe your approach to teaching?
Kiremidjian: [00:48:28] I love my students. [laughter] My approach to teaching? I’m very
traditional where I do lectures. In the last ten, fifteen years, I’ve been doing a
lot more projects. I find that hands-on projects are something that the
students really enjoy and embrace. While it is quite a bit of work in preparing
a project, I think that they’re very well worthwhile. I try to be engaging. I’m
very personable, I think.
Kiefer: Definitely.
Kiremidjian: [00:49:06] I am very open. Students feel free to come and talk to me at any
time. My philosophy is I try to explain the problems in the simplest possible
way and start with a very simple examples and gradually build on the

66

difficulty of examples as we move along. I try to present one concept at a
time and build on the concepts, and move from the more elementary
material to the more complex and bring everything together at the end.
These projects essentially attempt to integrate the various components of
what I’ve taught them through the class, through a course. I find that that’s
been quite effective. But being open and being open for questions.
I always chuckle as to the way some of my professors were-especially early on--very distant and remote and aloof, and “I am the
professor and you’re the student.” I’ve never believed in that. I’m very
approachable, at least I try to be. I treat my students as my colleagues, not as
this someone ten levels below me. I do that both with students in class as
well as my students that I work with for their PhD. I treat them as my
colleagues. I feel that I learn from them as much as they learn from me. It’s
always an open dialogue. Doesn’t mean I’m not demanding or I don’t have
expectations. I can be unhappy and tell them when I’m unhappy. But I don’t
think I’ve ever yelled at my students. [laughter] I may tell them that I’m not
happy and that’s a problem. If there is an issue, I let them know that there’s
an issue and that needs to be solved and needs to be addressed.
Overall, I try to have a very amicable relationship. I keep in touch
with practically all of my students. If I don’t keep in touch it’s because they’re
halfway around the world. Even those, when they are in the Bay Area, they
come and visit me. I’ve been fortunate. I feel so blessed with the students
I’ve had.
Kiefer: That’s wonderful.

67

Kiremidjian: [00:51:53] They have all contributed to my life, to my career. They’ve done
extremely well themselves.
Kiefer: That’s wonderful.
Kiremidjian: All of my students are doing so well. They’re successful and eager and bright.
I just feel so happy to be around them. My daughter has a little bit of
jealousy, I have to say. She says, “Oh, yeah. Okay. I know. You’re with your
students again, aren’t you? You’re happy, aren’t you?” [laughter] Not that I
don’t have a wonderful time with my daughter. Seta and I have a special
relationship as well. I just visited her a couple of weeks ago and we had a
wonderful weekend together. But my students are special.
Kiefer: You’ve taught undergrads as well as graduates.
Kiremidjian: [00:52:45] I’ve always had one undergraduate class and two graduate classes.
The undergraduates are a different set of students than the graduate students.
Our students are so smart. That’s what makes it so much fun to teach. I used
to get a little uptight when they would challenge me. Now I chuckle and
actually enjoy a little challenge from them. The undergraduates are very
interesting and very smart. It changes from class to class, but there are some
classes that are so enjoyable and so engaged and we do things. I do a project
with them or at least we have a fieldtrip that they enjoy. It was four years ago
we went to see the completion of the deck of the Bay Bridge, and we were
the first ones to get on, [the first] non-members of the building team that
were on the deck. [laughter]
Kiefer: How exciting!

68

Kiremidjian: [00:53:54] They were so excited that we went on the deck of the bridge just
as it was completed. They talked about that for days after that and said what
a phenomenal experience it was. We were talking on the boat and we went
under, we saw the old bridge, we saw the little condos that they had built for
the birds and--. [laughter]
Kiefer: Oh, my gosh.
Kiremidjian: [00:54:16] They had built the piers and the cables were down. It was quite
exciting. Two years ago, we went to look at the construction of the new
hospital, which is an absolutely fascinating project. They thought that this
was incredibly educational for them. That was a very nice experience also.
Kiefer: That’s the hospital on--?
Kiremidjian: Here on Stanford campus. The new hospital.
Kiefer: Yes.
Kiremidjian: [00:54:42] Yes. Yes. Yes.
Kiefer: You’ve done undergraduate advising, too?
Kiremidjian: Oh, yes. Freshman advising for many years. I did freshman advising probably
for eight, nine years. I can’t remember. I served on the Committee for
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid for a number of years. I did
freshman advising. I’ve done sophomore advising. I always have several
undergraduate advisees. I’m the [faculty advisor] representative for the CEE
[Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford], [civil] and environmental
engineering minor, so I get a lot of students coming to talk to me about
declaring a minor. It’s part of the everyday things that we do. I always have

69

to chuckle when people say, “Oh, you teach one class, and you teach four
hours a week? What do you do with the rest of your time?” [laughter]
Kiefer: This is what you do, right?
Kiremidjian: [00:55:40] Yes. Yes.
Kiefer: I understand that you had a NSF grant to advise, so to speak, other women
science professors in other universities?
Kiremidjian: Yes. a joint project. The lead is from Drexel University, one of my good
friends who organized most of the women that are in our category, our age
group, [laughter] you may want to say, or our level of our careers. We had a
young woman from Michigan, from Illinois, from Northeastern. Where else?
I’m probably forgetting. We wrote a joint proposal to NSF. The professor
from Drexel, her name is Aspasia Zerva. She always reminds me how when
she had to give her very first presentation at a conference and everyone else
was a man in the room except for me. I was sitting [on the front row] and
that put her at ease. [laughter]
Kiefer: Wonderful.
Kiremidjian: [00:56:58] We’ve become very good friends since then. She was the one who
initiated the program. We received the grant through the education program
in NSF to organize a group of earthquake engineering faculty, young
earthquake engineering female faculty, where we would serve as their
mentors. It’s worked out quite well. Each one of us had one or two women
for whom we were responsible. One of my mentees just received her tenure
at Georgia Tech, and the other one just changed schools so it’s a little early
for her. I don’t know. We met on regular basis. It was intended to be a very

70

productive, positive group. How do we address issues? How do we resolve
issues? You know, a lot of times women’s groups tend to get together and
everybody’s complaining and complaining.
What we said is we’re not going to complain, we’re going to think
and talk about what should we do to succeed. What are the right steps that
women should be taking to succeed? The goal is to succeed, not to complain.
The goal is to take the right actions. That’s what I like about it. I think that’s
the right way to do it. It’s been a really a great experience. We’ve had several
workshops where we talked about a lot of different issues. You know, how
do you manage a personal life and take care of children and take care of what
is the [tenure] process. The same way my husband was very helpful to me
with the tenure process. Even after I had talked to the chair of the
department, Garo was there every step along the way, saying, “Okay. You
need to take care of this, and you need to take care of this,” certain things
that the chair can tell you but he’s not going to tell you all of the steps along
the way. My husband, Garo, was very helpful to me. We served that purpose,
the group is called ENHANCE. I just remembered that. [laughter]
Kiefer: Okay.
Kiremidjian: [00:59:26] The group was called ENHANCE, and it is still in existence. It
hasn’t gone away because all of us are still mentoring the ladies and we’re
trying to actually grow it internationally. We went through several discussions
of what’s the expectation for the tenure process, what is the expectation for
promotion [to full professor] post-tenure, or what are the things that young
faculty need to know. It would be helpful for all faculty, not just for women

71

faculty, but our focus was on the women. It’s been a very interesting
experience.
Kiefer: That’s terrific. Back to civil engineering by that name at Stanford. The name
eventually changed to Civil and Environmental Engineering.
Kiremidjian: [01:00:14] Right.
Kiefer: When they added “Environmental,” why did they add it, and what impact did
that have on your own coursework?
Kiremidjian: It had no impact at all. [laughter]
Kiefer: Okay.
Kiremidjian: It was really more of a name change. Environmental problems have been the
focus of our attention for some time now. A lot of schools were changing
their name to be able to draw the attention of students--that they do have a
program that focuses on the environment. Traditionally our environmental
engineering program was the only program that was focusing on the
environment. Since then there are several programs. The energy and the
environment group is now there, and there’s the earth environment, and
whatever the program is. Those programs have mushroomed and grown.
The original environmental program was part of Civil Engineering. We had
faculty, Perry McCarty and a lot of other faculty--Lynn Hildemann and Jim
Leckie [James Leckie] and others who were environmental engineers dealing
with environmental issues. Changing the name, well, there was a lot of
discussion, should we or should not we.
We came to the conclusion that it really won’t change anything from
the way we’re doing things, but it will help recognize the fact that there is a

72

solid, strong environmental group at Stanford and that students can come to
Stanford to study environmental engineering. That was the main reason for
the change. But it had no impact on what we were doing.
Kiefer: From the time you came to Stanford as a graduate school in the early 1970s
to now, how would you say that the culture and attitudes have changed
within civil and environmental engineering?
Kiremidjian: [01:02:33] Attitude towards women you mean?
Kiefer: I’m going to say women, yes. But also maybe towards students in general. In
the 1970s great changes took place. A sense of diversity and having students
be more vocal, etc. Now all these years have passed by, and I was just
wondering how you would compare the culture you walked into to the
culture right now.
Kiremidjian: [01:03:02] We are in a very unique area, Silicon Valley. While if you go to
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, you would not be surprised to
find students who are very entrepreneurially minded, you will find that
attitude also in Civil and Environmental Engineering. I see a lot of students
taking the entrepreneurial classes and thinking about ways to come up with
original ideas to start their own companies. We saw that also in the late 1990s
and early 2000 during the dotcom era. There was sort of lull after the
dotbomb of 2002. We have seen that again. What also we are seeing is that
there is a renaissance, a renewal of our infrastructure right now.
There’s a lot of attention being given to the renewal of infrastructure,
to designing structures in a different way, incorporating new materials, new
shapes. With the computational capabilities and the memory capacity of

73

computers today, we are able to design some really unique shapes, structures,
and we are developing new materials. We are seeing a renaissance in civil and
structural engineering that we had not seen for some time. I see our field
moving in a direction that is very positive and very exciting. A lot of that
excitement is also carrying through our students or to our students. It’s the
same with the environmental engineering.
I think the challenge is the attention that is given to preserving our
environment, with the issues around climate change having had a
tremendous impact in what people are doing in our department. I think if I
say that there’s a change, I think those are the kind of changes that I see. Our
students are so much more open to new ideas. If I think back of the students
who were here when I came, and the first set of students that I was teaching,
they were much more traditional structural engineers. They just wanted to
learn the methods and they just wanted to go out and design the way things
were accepted.
I think the new structural engineer certainly challenges some of the
ideas of the past. I think we’re seeing much more interesting concepts being
implemented, some of the new transportation ideas that are coming around.
We have to address those challenges with overpopulation and concentration
of populations in very close areas. We’ve seen the population explosion of
the Bay Area, which is creating a tremendous traffic problem and housing
problem and all kinds of other problems. To a great extent, it falls on the
civil engineering profession to address these problems. We are trying to look
at solutions. We have to come up with creative new solutions.

74

We cannot rely on the solutions of ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred
years ago. We have to come up with new solutions because these are new
problems that have not been addressed before. In some ways, I envy young
people because there are so many new opportunities to be creative and to
come up with unique solutions to the problems.
Kiefer: In summary, I am going to ask you a couple of things about Stanford in
general. One would be what would you say is one of the most memorable
experiences you’ve had here?
Kiremidjian: Oh, gosh. There’s so many most memorable experiences.
Kiefer: Oh, just one.
Kiremidjian: [01:07:59] Getting my tenure. [laughter]
Kiefer: Okay. It sounds great.
Kiremidjian: I think that was probably one of the high points of my career. Getting tenure
was like really a stamp of approval or achievement that I felt being the first
woman to actually go through the tenure process and getting tenure at
Stanford. Just working with wonderful colleagues and working with great
students. I can’t think of any other single event. You know, there are things
that happen all the time and that I’ve been part of. I feel fortunate to have
been part of the initiation of the Blume Center, and the growth of the Blume
Center, and bringing it to a point where it has become a world-renowned
institution. I just feel incredibly fortunate to have been part of that entire
process.
Kiefer: Can you name me a person or two who you think have been key in your
career and making you who you are?

75

Kiremidjian: [01:09:34] I probably would name several.
Kiefer: Okay.
Kiremidjian: Starting with Haresh Shah. Another person who made a tremendous impact
and influence, had enormous influence on me was John Blume. A third
person who I had the fortune to work with was Emilio Rosenblueth [Emilio
Rosenblueth Deutsch], who is a very big figure in earthquake engineering. He
was at University of Mexico. I had a joint project with him after the 1985
earthquake off the coast of Mexico. He also had a tremendous influence on
my research. I’m sure there were so many other people that I had worked
with over the years. The last person that I would mention is my husband,
Garo. It was his encouragement through all these years. He was always there
for me. I don’t think I could have done that without him.
Kiefer: That’s wonderful. I know that you’ve received numerous awards. I know
they’re all meaningful. But which ones come to mind as being the most
special, the most meaningful to you?
Kiremidjian: [01:11:11] I’ll start backwards.
Kiefer: Okay.
Kiremidjian: Being elected distinguished member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers I thought was a tremendous recognition. Mind you, I’m only the
fourth woman of the hundred and some years’ history of the society to be
given the distinction. There were only three other women before me who
had been elected distinguished members over the hundred or so years of
history of the society. 130 years, I think, since the founding of the American
Society of Civil Engineers.

76

Kiefer: Oh, that’s wonderful.
Kiremidjian: [01:11:56] I thought that was a tremendous recognition. There were two of
us that year that were elected, so we were four and five. You can say I was
four, she was five. Doesn’t matter.
Kiefer: [laughter] Okay.
Kiremidjian: [01:12:09] It is a unique recognition and I really cherish that. The others were
being given the C. Martin Duke Award by the American Society of Civil
Engineers for research in lifeline earthquake engineering. It’s also very
special. I thought that was very, very special. I can’t remember some of the
others. I’m sorry. [laughter] I don’t dwell on what I’ve been given. [laughter]
Kiefer: It wasn’t to denigrate any of it.
Kiremidjian: Right. Right.
Kiefer: But just to what would come to mind right away. Then I’d also like to ask
have you ever been back to Bulgaria?
Kiremidjian: [01:13:02] Twice. The first time was in 1972 during our honeymoon. In
Europe we decided to hop back in Bulgaria. Bulgaria was still under
communism in 1972. It was probably the most negative experience that we
had had anywhere in the world because we were followed everywhere. They
opened our luggage and exposed all the film that we had taken for the month
before that in Europe. We had the same guy follow us from Sofia all the way
to the Black Sea. We would go to dinner, he would be sitting across. We
would be in the middle of a small resort town, he would be following us.
And also our relatives were very nervous to see us.

77

We found after we left and we came back, the very last night before
we left we had dinner with all our relatives at a restaurant in Sofia. I danced
with my uncle. When we came back, we found out that he had been fired
from his job because he danced with me.
Kiefer: Oh.
Kiremidjian: [01:14:21] Yes. My cousins were petrified to be seen in public with us
because we were coming from the United States. When we landed in Vienna
after leaving Bulgaria, I vowed that I will never, ever, ever go back. When
communism came down in 1989, Bulgaria also became whatever you want to
call it, the so-called semi-democracy. It still is semi-democracy, I would say.
My husband went back because his family had a lot of property that was
confiscated, and he went back several times actually to try to retrieve the
property that his family had. He kept telling me that, “Oh, things have
changed. We should go. We should go.”
I kept saying, “No.” Then finally it was not until our daughter Seta
really wanted to go, and I said, “Oh, Okay. Okay. I’ll go.” I was very
pleasantly surprised. I had to say it had changed so much.
Growing up, I remember that my parents saying Bulgaria was the
breadbasket and the agricultural center of that whole region. You know,
there was never any shortage of any food. When I was growing up,
everything that was grown in Bulgaria went to the Soviet Union and there
was very little left for the people in Bulgaria. One week there won’t be
potatoes. The next week there won’t be onions. I remember the whole family
lining up and waiting in line to get one egg each. My parents were just

78

opposed to what happened.4 Where is all that food going? Because we would
see in the movies how the agricultural co-ops would be producing and
cultivating acres and acres with food. But it all went to Russia.
When we went back in 2002, the amount of agricultural products was
just enormous. You know, just the plenty was so obvious, and the quality was
phenomenal. The food was wonderful. People were so happy. It was
wonderful to see how happy everybody was. There was definitely an air of
excitement that surrounded everyone. It was a wonderful experience. I
haven’t been back since, but I guess I’m afraid that I may not have that same
great experience. A lot of our friends, my cousins are still in Bulgaria and say,
“Oh, you guys should come. You should come.” I’m sure we will.
Kiefer: That was what year? That last visit?
Kiremidjian: 2002.
Kiefer: What else would you like to do if you ever retire from Stanford and you have
more time?
Kiremidjian: [01:17:28] I’ll probably do some writing. I have been hoping to write a book.
I have the initial chapters. I probably will do that.
Kiefer: This would be on?
Kiremidjian: [01:17:45] On earthquake hazard and risk assessment, and what we now call
performance-based engineering. This is one of the classes that I teach. I’m
done consulting. I don’t consult anymore. [laughter] Yes. I’d like to go back
to playing piano. I haven’t touched a piano in about thirty years, which is
going to be a challenge in itself. I’ve started playing tennis. I’m just learning,
4

[Kiremidjian’s note] They were opposed to the communist regime and the resulting scarcity of products
throughout the country.
79

and it’s really challenging. I keep telling all my friends it’s very hard to teach
an old dog new tricks. [laughter] It’s really challenging. But it gets me out and
gets me with people and I’m actually really enjoying it. I’m having fun. I’m
terrible at it, but I’m having fun. I end up laughing a lot because I miss so
many balls. [laughter]
Kiefer: The balls are small, aren’t they?
Kiremidjian: [01:18:43] Right, right. They get smaller somehow [laughter] as you get older.
I’d like to do some painting. I’ve done so much traveling with my husband.
A lot of people say, “Oh yeah, we’ll start traveling once we’re retired.” We’ve
traveled in so many places. We like to go back to the places that we like the
most. I personally also have a long list of places that I would like to visit that
my husband, Garo, doesn’t like to go. Some of the places that I’d like to go
are Vietnam and Cambodia and Indonesia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.
Some of these African countries that I’ve never been to.
There are several countries in South America that I’d like to visit, like
Chile and Peru and Argentina. I’m scheduled to go to Chile and Peru next
year. We’ll see if it happens. There’s a conference in Chile, so I’m hoping to
take advantage of that. Yes. So I may figure out a way to get to those places.
Some of the other places that we would like to travel more are within the
United States. There are so many places that we have not seen in the United
States. We’ve been everywhere else in the world, just about all of Europe, but
we still don’t know all of the United States. There are so many places that we
would like to go within the United States.
Kiefer: On a road trip?

80

Kiremidjian: [01:20:21] On a road trip.
Kiefer: It’s the only way.
Kiremidjian: Yes. On a road trip. Just stop and explore and visit some of the national
parks and some of the great cities. You know, we’ve to Boston, New York,
Washington, and Seattle, and Atlanta, and a few other places, New Orleans.
But there are a lot of other cities that we would like to visit and find out
more about the people and things that are done.
Kiefer: Is there anything else that you’d like to mention before we close?
Kiremidjian: [01:20:55] All I can say that this has been a tremendous ride. I’ve been at
Stanford forty-four years and I wouldn’t change anything. I think it’s a great
place. I love what I do. My classes are in the main quad. Been here forty-four
years, but every time I walk into the main quad, I take a deep breath and take
in the view and the beauty of the campus.
Kiefer: Wonderful. I want to thank you so much for taking the time to do this
interview. It’s been fascinating. Thank you very much.
Kiremidjian: Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity. [01:21:30]
