Speaker 1: Okay.  Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight magazine, People magazine-ish type questions we ask that only require short answers.

Speaker 1: Well, one that I've been saying most lately is that, "If you see Queens, you see the world", because we have such a multi-ethnic, we are the most multi-ethnic county in the world; that would be one, but a lifetime statement was one that my mother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent] gave me and she said, "Put your eye on the star and keep it there and keep on rising."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I've repeated that to many young people.
Story_ID: 178228
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  But we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm one of those fortunate people to have had two mothers, okay.  My birth mother, her name was Audrey McKenzie Sargent.  Sargent was--is my father--my family name.
Speaker 1: Can I ask you to spell her name?  We always spell (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: A-U-D-R-E-Y, McKenzie, M-C-K-E-N-Z-I-E, Sargent, S-A-R-G-E-N-T.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her, her birthplace was in Georgetown, British Guyana, which is in the Caribbean.  And her date of birth I am not positive about.  But of course she would have been born in the earliest part of the twentieth century.
Speaker 1: Yes, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father I know was born eight--1898--so she was about twenty years younger than him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so maybe 1910 or so?
Speaker 2: Maybe even a little earlier than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the earliest part of the nineteenth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --century.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and, and your other mother, your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --stepmother?
Speaker 2: --stepmother was born on, oh gosh.  She was born in Southern Pines, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what's her name again?
Speaker 2: Her name is Artemesor, A-R-T-E-M-E-S-O-R, Hasty, H-A-S-T-Y, Sargent (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She, of course married after that, after my father died, too.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you know her date of birth and?
Speaker 2: Now you know she didn't tell us.  We knew her birthday, which was sometime in April, but to tell us the--she, we never got years and I finally after she died I saw she was, she died at eighty-nine years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when was that?
Speaker 2: That was about maybe five or six years ago.
Story_ID: 178229
Speaker 1: First of all what do you know about your ancestors on your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --on your birth mother [Audrey McKenzie Sargent]'s side?
Speaker 2: All right.  On my birth mother's side, she was a child of the McKenzie family, which was rather well off in Guyana, British Guyana.  There's McKenzie mines, McKenzie Street and so on.  She wanted to come to America, this is what they tell me, but her family really didn't want her to leave, so what she did is that she actually completed what was required.  In those days a girl--the highest education for a girl was to go to the convent and so she went to the convent.  I know very little about Guyana.  I'm trying to learn as much as I can.  I always have over the years because my father [Jerald Sargent] sort of really cut himself off from it.  He was not happy there.  I'll tell you why.  But she, so what she did she contacted my aunt, my father's sister here in America and my grandfather became her sponsor.  And so I--she told her parents she said, "I've done everything you've asked me.  I want to go to America."  And so that's how she came and she stayed there at my grandfather's house in Harlem [New York, New York] and my father would come to visit his father and when he did that's when he saw my mother, and they got married.  I don't know very much about her family.  We only have letters, thank goodness people wrote letters in those days.  I know that her mother had quite a few children.  Many of them are scattered all over the place.  Going way back in the ancestry, from what I understand that, I don't know how far back it goes, but it seems as though we have a Scottish great, great, great, great-grandfather who married an African lady and they settled in Guyana.  I've since began [sic] to kind of look at what happened in Guyana.  I believe it was like a Siberia for a person like this ancient grandfather of mine and probably because he married an African lady.  So they lived there.  But they did very well financially there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Guyana was, in the old pirate movies they called a Spanish Main and stuff.  I think, I think it was Guyana, it was, was like close to that type (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, I never heard Spanish there.  Only thing I ever heard was British [English].  When I look at--fortunately my mother had a lot of photographs that she brought to America with her.  And when I looked at my family, it's like a checkerboard.  My godmother [Ellen Bradford] actually, now this is where the story gets a little mixed in with my father, okay, but my godmother was very, very dark, very dark and yet she was Lady Bradford there.  And her husband died jumping polo.  And it broke her heart, okay.  My mother's family was very close to her, that's why she was my godmother.  My name was supposed to be Ellen.  Her name is Ellen, but my mother decided to make it Helen.  And my mother was a bridesmaid, a flower girl in my godmother's wedding.  And my father--my real grandmother was their laundress.  My father's mother was their laundress.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories that are passed down from that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Very little, very little because she died when I was so young.  And my father's father, as I, you heard me say he was already in America.  We looked at papers that my cousin [Delores] was able to acquire showing the passports and so on as to when my grandfather came to America.  He brought with him my three aunts and my uncle.  My father was not with them.  I'll explain that when I go on to talk about my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how old were you when, when your mother passed?
Speaker 2: Three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And my younger sister [Joan Sargent] was one year old.
Story_ID: 178230
Speaker 1: Now can, can you tell us about your, your stepmother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My stepmother, as I said she grew up in the South.  She went, when she--I hear them talk about--St. Augustine [Florida].  She went there.  Wilberforce [ph.] is some, is a name that I've heard her speak about.  She came from a family of five children.  And her mother, I got to know her mother, and that was who we called "Grandma," who settled in Raleigh, North Carolina, where we used to spend at least half of the summer, my sister [Joan Sargent], myself and my cousin [Delores].  But mama [Artemesor Hasty Sargent] and her sister Vanessa decided to come to America to find a better life for themselves.  So these two young women came to New York City [New York] and my mother found space in a Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association] that was clean and the food was good and, and it was a safe place and, in Harlem [New York, New York].  And that's why she really insisted that I go there as a teenager.  She went to Parsons School of Design [New York, New York].  We have some of her drawings.  She was a dressmaker and my aunt who had a daughter, a little baby, stayed home and kept the house, although eventually she went into the dressmaking business, too.  And my stepmother, my stepmother became a sample maker in factories.  But the thing that's probably most prominent about her, she worked in the sweatshops.  And she helped to organize the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union [ILGWU].  When it was a serious picket line my father would go with her or sometimes for her.  When it was just a peaceful demonstration, a peaceful walk, I could go.  I was about six, five or six, but I could walk with her when it was peaceful.  But of course in my house the union was a very special, special place.  A special entity that we all respected and she was very proud of that, of her work and I still talk about it even when I was in the state legislature on the labor committee we talked about doing away with sweatshops, which has occurred here in America too.  Well this was all in New York City that this took place anyhow.
Speaker 1: Especially with the constant union influx of, of, of people from other countries (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, at the time, yes.  Well that's all that America is made of, of most of our cities.  Except for the native, you know, the people who were born, Indians.
Speaker 1: I guess I want to say that it tells you to take advantage of the immigrants (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --who are coming in because they knew the job.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was brought up from the South and there were others like herself that came here to find a better life for themselves because in those days segregation was high, lynching was--I remember lynching, I remember Emmitt Till, all the horrors of the South were alive and well.  And it was very difficult for a person to advance themselves in the South.  And so that's why she came here and with her sister.  She only had one sister, so, Auntie came with her.  And here she was able to help to form the union for which she had a great deal of respect and I do too.  She was able to live to eighty-nine years old with a pension that she was able to get through her union.  And she was able to--she came to New York, she really never left New York until after my father passed, after--my father died when I was 16, but she remarried and she married a bishop and after--and she took care of him because he was rather elderly, Bishop Lee Cox [ph.].  And when he died she went back down to Southern Pines [North Carolina].  She bought a house, cash, on the same grounds that her family had, you know, had for many, many years.  And she stayed there for twenty years.  Every year she came back to New York City and got a full examination, physical examination at her union headquarters right down there on Seventh Avenue [New York, New York].  And towards--and I use to just drop her off there and then go pick her up, but towards the end I, I wanted to go through the whole process with her and it was good that I did.  She had lost thirty pounds and I learned a lot, and like she needed glasses.  The glasses were something like five dollars, but she didn't want to spend five dollars for the glasses.  So I was glad to do that and insisted that she take some other tests and everything.  But the union became very--I talked about it when I went to her funeral down there because they wanted to know what happened to her in all the years before the twenty years that she came back home to Southern Pines [North Carolina] and I told them about her.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was proud to do it.
Story_ID: 178231
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Jerald, and it's with a "J" I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Cyril, C-Y-R-I-L.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Sargent.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Eighteen ninety-eight, and he was, too, born in Georgetown [British Guyana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well, that's interesting.  My grandfather was born in Barbados, okay.  And he left Guyana with my three aunts and my uncle when they were adolescents.  My aunt, the oldest under my father was 105 when she just died, Aunt Pearl.  My grandfather came to New York and he was a typesetter for the New York Times.  My own father, my father was really a child out-of-wedlock, it was my grandfather's first born and he loved him and he, you know, whenever he went to his father's house he was treated like a little prince.  But then he would go home and as I told you before, my real grandmother was a laundress for my mother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent]'s family and my godmother [Lady Bradford]'s family.  And the dicot--he could never get accustomed to the dichotomy.  And so he was like--and he was very feisty, my father, and I guess the oldest son, you know, and he never got use to that dichotomy.  And one time, it had to be the Church of England, which is the Episcopalian church, but the priest would go through the town, and my father spit on his ring, okay, in anger, and ran and jumped on one of those ships.  And those ships--it was a Slavic nation and, you know, it was a Slavic boat and he almost died you know, hiding from everybody, but they found him and nursed him back to health; and he really traveled all over the world.  He spoke about seven languages. And from time to time he would come into New York and he would go see his father.  And one of those times when he came, and that's when he met my mother and that stabilized him, okay (laughter), here in New York City [New York].  But, all throughout his lifetime though, he became a Garveyite, naturally he was a merchant seaman and he had been to Africa a few times and he felt that if black people could just go there while it was just nothing but virgin country, if they could go there they could really help to build -- a country free of discrimination and oppression, and you know, that he was, that was faced here in America and this whole part of the world.  And so that he was very much for going back into Africa.  And my father, he used to take little passages from the Bible, prophecies, he used to stack the newspapers beside his bed, and he wanted us to read the newspapers, but we had to put them back in order.  And he had, like, a little assignment book that you put your school assignments.  And in that little book, he would identify the prophecies of the Bible with current happenings today.  Now how real they were (laughter)-- I don't know.  In those days there was no television and so my father would gather with his friends on (unclear), in fact, some of those same Slavic men that--whatever language it was that they were speaking, they would come to my house, our house on Saturday night and play cards and talk in a tongue that none of us understood; but I was the oldest, I was able to kind of sit by daddy's chair for a while until he chased me away.
Story_ID: 178232
Speaker 1: What happened is, let me go back a little bit because, how did my--what happened with my real mother [Audrey McKenzie Sargent].  My real mother, my father [Jerald Sargent] and mother got married and they had their own apartment.  My mother took in two ladies from Guyana, British Guyana.  My parents never lived to see it be anything but British Guyana.  I think my father would be kind of pleased with what's happening there now.  At any rate, they took in two ladies and one had a very bad cough, it was tuberculosis.  My mother caught it and had to be rushed away from us and you know, you can imagine the agony for her and my father.  My father was able to go see her with all of the, you know, protection and so on.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They called it a sanatorium they take you to (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yeah, right, because all they could do was keep her comfortable because they had no cure for tuberculosis and she did die.  And my father of course, never really got over it.  And they said that I got very protective of my younger sister [Joan Sargent].  I hate to tell you I still feel that way today (laughter).  She's fine, she's doing great, but that was, it was a real tragedy.  And being a mother myself, I can imagine what she must have gone through.  Well, my father found a lady who cared for us during the week and he would come and pick us up on Friday evenings, not at first, at first my godmother [Ellen Bradford] was here, she had come to, her husband died and she came to America and going to her house was like going to a palace.  There was a music room, right.  She lived in Hamilton Heights in Harlem [New York, New York].  She lived in very prestigious, beautiful, big apartments, and we would go visit her--
Story_ID: 178233
Speaker 1: Now this is Lady Bradford, right?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Bradford.
Speaker 1: Mrs. Bradford, okay.
Speaker 2: That's right, Ellen Bradford.  And she would, we would go--actually her sister, Aunt Mims [ph.] took care of us immediately after my mother [Audrey McKenzie Sargent] died, and while my father [Jerald Sargent] was going back and forth to the hospital.  And we would be at her house and Aunt Mim [ph.] would take care of us.  But my father did find a lady to take care of us during the week and then he would pick us up on Friday night.  Well one of those Friday nights we were there sitting on the bed, and they had given us something to eat. And the lady had a card game on Friday nights and my father came to pick us up, and my stepmother [Artmesor Hasty Sargent] got there before he did.  And she saw these two little girls sitting on the bed, and we looked very much like her, and she started playing with us and talking to us and my father came in and saw her, and he liked this. And so what he did, he courted her for about a few months and they got married. So that's how that bond happened.  The whole--my father was also not very pleased with his own father, so that's why he really went to see his father [in New York], but on one of those occasions when he did he did meet my mother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent].  Had my real mother [Audrey McKenzie Sargent] lived I would have been much closer to my family, my grandfather and so on.  But my--I wanted you to know how everything evolved as far as the family structure was concerned.  And we lived--my, even the marriage between stepmother and my father was not all that it should have been, but they gave us a good secure home, kind of strict (laughter), very strict and, and it gave us a good foundation.  One day my stepmother did tell me, tell us one day that she was going to leave, okay.  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: When you were a little girl?
Speaker 2: --Well no, she started telling us that when I was about ten or eleven, okay.  And she, and at this point I knew how to do everything in the house.  When I came along, at twelve years old you knew how to do everything, and my mother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent], by the way, got asthma from working in those sweatshops.  And from time to time she would get into an attack and she would sit in the bed, and she couldn't breathe and here, we'd call the ambulance -- they'd come and they'd give her the injection and as a result, she would calm down--
Story_ID: 178234
Speaker 1: Can you tell us, when we hear that, we would hear like terms like sweatshop you know, can you describe what one is like?  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I can tell (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and what she--well what conditions were that she worked in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: It's probably, it's as close to slavery as you can get, okay.  In any, any business the man who owns the business wants to make the most money that he can.  He doesn't want to be spending time and making sure that the environment is clean and that people are protected.  And he wants them to work long hours; he wants to give them little pay.  And the conditions that surrounded the women in the sweatshops, first of all the ventilation was very poor; they're working with fabric.  There is always a lot of fibers and everything in the air and under terrible conditions.  Workloads were long, no breaks, you had to decide (unclear) eat your food at your machine and pressure, pressure, pressure to keep on going.  And the environment probably was the thing that gave her the asthma, but it's also a very stressful situation, which also can promote asthma.  And if you--when I go into them nowadays they look better because I was on the labor committee when I was in the state legislature and I went into some of those sweatshops.  I went in, not with the [U.S.] State Department of Labor, I went in with the unions, just to look over things and--because we have them, we have the old--the Italian women who first came to Corona here in Queens [New York]--I'm skipping ahead, they worked in those sweatshops.  They also took work home to do.  And, so it was a, was a nice way for the new women coming in, the Hispanic women coming in and the Asian women to get into those jobs, plus they could take the work home, it was convenient.  But of course the sweatshop of today looks different than it did years ago.  And when I went through with the union, with the state person we never went in, but he pointed out the locations which we've been able to, I've done a lot with those women to get them out of that sweatshop, but at least there was air breathing because we have rules in place now that you have to, well, labor rules, you have to give them breaks, you have to give them a lunch hour, a decent lunch hour, you have to make sure that there is good ventilation, it can't be a fire trap.  We had that big building, that Triangle shirt [Shirtwaist] factory where the women just perished, they just died, okay, no way out, you know.  So it's just very, very bad conditions.  And it was terrible back there before the union got into it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent] like fought, your stepmother fought to build the unions (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: -- and establish it?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  It meant picketing and it meant being intimidated by your employer and all of that sort of thing.  It was the early days of organizing unions.
Speaker 1: Was it the International Ladies Garment Workers Union [ILGWU]?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  It's now called, what is it called now, they've changed their name.  It's not the Working Families Party [WFP], it's another name, it will come to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They've changed the name now to make it more comprehensive.
Story_ID: 178235
Speaker 1: And your father [Jerald Sargent] worked for the New York Times.  He was a typesetter?  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: My grandfather.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My grandfather, my grandfather.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my grandfather.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --When he came here he worked for the, as a typesetter for The New York Times and grandmama, his mother, his wife, they brought the children here and settled here I would say like in, like, 1919 or so they came to America, that's what the passports say.  And, but he did have that job with The New York Times.  I don't know how he became a typesetter, but he had that job.  And I didn't know that until later on in life.  And grandmama, his wife was like illiterate, but very smart with money.  And so they bought a house in, in what we call Strivers Row [St. Nicholas Historic District, New York, New York] today.  She bought two houses.  She bought the one was the family homestead and the one next to it.  She also bought a house for Aunt Ismae [ph.], who is my-- other aunt around the corner there, in that general area off St. Nicholas Avenue [New York, New York].  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Now that's a big, that's what we call, that's like a, kind of an exclusive area of Harlem [New York, New York] of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: --Strivers Row.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: It's been songs written about Strivers Row.
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and then she bought a house for my Uncle Donald around the corner.  In fact when you go there the sign is still very clear, you know, to walk your horses, walk your horses into the back, evidently they had stable for the horses, it was in carriage buggy days and it, but the sign in still there.  Now of course, they drive in and put their cars in a garage.  And she was--the family homestead is the first house on this side of the opening and then next to it was the house that she bought for Aunt Pearl.  And the houses were connected.  I can't tell you much--well, let me just finish about grandmama.  As I told you she was illiterate, but she took his little salary from whatever he got from The Times, and she had, she would buy property with it.  And so she bought a Cadillac, her driver was both her bodyguard, he carried the gun to help her collect the rents.  She believed in real estate (laughter) and he would help her collect the rents, but he was also a handyman.  He could fix, he was a carpenter, a plumber, and he could fix things for her, too.  And he could be, and protect her, you know, in case of, because she would be collecting cash.  In those days they didn't know what checks were.  And so she did that, she built that little empire, and it was great (laughter)--
Story_ID: 179626
Speaker 1: Okay. You mentioned that your father was a Garveyite (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I think it's important to maybe explore that [Garveyism] now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, well it's kind of hard today to imagine how life, how difficult life could be.  Naturally as children we were somewhat protected from it, but my father [Jerald Sargent] was a man struggling to make, to raise a family, raise children and do the right thing.  When he came to America, when he did meet my mother, he decided that, of course now he, he's grounded, he's not going to go back to sea anymore.  He went, he got a job, the--what do they call it, the WPA, Workers Progress Association, or whatever it was called [Works Progress Administration].  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Administration, yeah...
Speaker 2: --Administration.  They [Works Progress Administration] taught him how to be a real painter, a real painter, house painter.  He got really good at it and he would, he did paint, you know, different things and wonderful murals and things were developed by artists.  It was a real government sponsored work program that worked.  It worked beautifully.  First of all, it helped to build New York City.  It helped to build New York City.  But for my father, it gave him a skill that he could sell.  And my father became an independent contractor and he would get jobs painting places and that was great.  He, like I said, so many things were going on as far as discrimination and so on.  The lynchings, I mean, we would read about them all the time.  It was not like it was far away from us--
Story_ID: 179627
Speaker 1: Were they in the Amsterdam News and different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Amsterdam, even in the regular newspapers they had it you know.  There were many things, and even in New York City [New York] things were not really integrated at a good rate at all, so that-- we were constantly reminded that we were in a negative situation.  And, and he felt that he, while he, [Marcus] Garvey, the Garveyite Movement sort of slowed down when they couldn't get that ship going.  I don't have the exact dates and I should because I learned all about that when I was at the Langston Hughes Library [Clinton, Tennessee], but it sort of slowed down, that whole movement slowed down because the whole idea was to get the boat over there.  I, and so even men like Mr. Dickens in Harlem [New York, New York] became a (unclear)--Inez [ph.] Dickens is his daughter, she is now running for the city council.  But, and when I went to his funeral, that's why his family came.  His family came to New York City to hook up with the boat.  It was so bad my father [Jerald Sargent] after all ran away from Guyana, which was British Guyana, which was very oppressive.  He would say that, "The Queen has rubies in her crown and your belly is empty, something is wrong with the system."   I heard that many a day, all right.  And so getting away and plus, my father had the advantage of traveling all over the world and seeing the way the rest of the world was.  The rest of the world was a lot more liberal to black people than, than America was itself, okay, and so because we, the main, because of the slavery movement, if the slavery movement didn't happen, and I've sometimes when I've been speaker at [Reverend] Martin Luther King[, Jr.] breakfasts and so on, I say, "Suppose it didn't happen through slavery, supposing that blacks came from Africa and from the Caribbean just like everybody else as immigrants, things would have been very, very different."  But you see, slavery went through Caribbean, too, went through the Caribbean and people liked to get slaves that were raised in the Caribbean because they were--trained under the British and they knew how to do things a certain way.  My father came from a country even through it was under British rule, it was a, it was a black country, you know black country.  It was also a country of a lot of mixed blood because it was on, it was a coastal country, but that's true of the whole Caribbean.  It's true of a lot of America too, okay.  And so my father felt that was something that was, and he died without British Guyana being anything but under the British rule.  He died when I was 16, while we still had so many horrible things going on in America.  So it kept this drive for liberation alive in him.  And-- he became like a scholar, an unofficial scholar.  I told you about, he would get together with other men on, on like a Saturday night and of course he used to listen to the fights, you know, Joe Louis fights, and he, the boxing, the men liked to sit around the radio and listen to that.  And I remember, "Hot Jim and dynamite Joe Louis won the fight," I remember as a kid saying that.  But when my father would, what he considered entertainment and relaxing was sitting around with his friends and philosophizing, you know, "and what if," and so on and so forth.  And this took place and they would have these great debates, you know.  And like I said, I used to kind of be able to sit by his, on the floor next to him for a while and listen to, especially when he was talking English.  One--the earlier days of the Slavic languages being taught, well I was very, very young.  It was sort of like when he and my stepmother first got married.  But once we moved, well, even while we were in, while we were in Manhattan we, we moved from Manhattan [New York, New York] to the Bronx [New York] when I was seven years old.  My father was a house painter and it was a gentleman named Mr. Chillis [ph.].  I still remember his name, who was Greek, and he had bought two of these railroad flats, buildings, apartments that go all the way through. And he decided to, to make them smaller and to make them efficiency units and so my father got the job to paint.  And my father moved--that's the first incident that he had with the Bronx, and he liked the Bronx.  It was very nice, it was open and so on and we were living in Harlem [New York, New York].  And so he decided he was going to move us to the Bronx because he said that Harlem was no place to raise his two daughters.  Well I loved Harlem, I'm a little kid, my friends are all around me, the school is across the street, what's a kid to do.  You father wants to move you to the Bronx you've got to go to the Bronx.  And Mr. Chillis [ph.] was doing an interesting thing.  It was an all-white neighborhood and he was going to rent to coloreds, as they say, to coloreds.  And so my father got the job to paint, to do all the painting and my father decided we were going to move in one of those little three-room apartments, okay.  Now we had always had six-room apartments.  Every time my mother [stepmother, Artemesor Hasty Sargent] wanted a paint job she would move to another place.  And so we had to squeeze all the furniture--in the living room was a piano, a living room set, and our parents' bed.  And then in the bedroom was the beds for my sister [Joan Sargent] and I and the wardrobes and stuff where we stored clothing and my mother's sewing machine.  But that's--we moved to the Bronx and that's the circumstances under which we moved.
Story_ID: 179628
Speaker 1: You were seven?
Speaker 2: I was seven.  I was seven when we moved there and my father [Jerald Sargent] went through quite a bit because the whole idea of what Mr. Chillis [ph.] did caught on and other people would buy these buildings.  I remember the building across the street, and mind you my little friends that I had in the Bronx [New York], nearly all of them were immigrants because their parents had come over from Europe, Poland and other places, and so they were like, their mothers never really learned to speak English too well.  The fathers did because they had to go to work.  But all the kids spoke; they learned to speak English very quickly.  And so my friends in those days were like Greek, a lot of them were Jewish.  They were Jewish from different parts of Europe, you know.  And I just watched 'Fiddler on the Roof', the Jewish community, they just moved and the last move, he was going to move his family to America.  And all of these people, all of these people came to America by boat, including my father and mother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent].  They all came by boat.  And they were not going back any place by that boat.  They were lucky to get there.  We have letters from my family that they were trying to come to America.  They'd come here and they were turned away.  They were British subjects so they went on to Canada, and one of my aunts actually, she was pregnant and she lost a child during that voyage up there.  We have the letter describing it all because letters, thank God we had letters.  I don't know what we're going to about this generation (laughter), but we had handwritten letters.  Actually, when my mother [Audrey McKenzie Sargent] gave birth to me my father went home and wrote her a letter, and wrote her a letter.  She was in the hospital, he was going to see her the next day, but in the letter he expressed his feelings and his joy with having his firstborn child, and he was giving her a piano as a gift for having me.  My--and this was like the depression was creeping up on us in those days.
Speaker 1: Well, you, you were born in 1929 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --The stock market crashed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: --you were born the year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that it crashed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so.
Speaker 2: But even so, they were still kind of pretty, you know, it hadn't hit the family yet.  Now my sister [Joan Sargent] was two years later, and by that time things were different.  There was no present for my mother, but there was a letter so we know a lot about her birth, too.  But the letters that went between them--that's the only record that my sister and I have of my mother and father's relationship, which was--we treasure those letters.  They're, they're very important to us and we're so glad that we have them and trying to keep them without them being spoiled is not so easy, but we do have them and we read them.  And, but with any rate, my father moved us to the Bronx [New York] and I was one of ten black kids in the local elementary school.
Story_ID: 179629
Speaker 1: Now, before I get you to school, can you describe the neighborhood?  We always ask this question: what was, what was some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up?  And you can go back to Harlem [New York, New York] and then take us to the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 2: Okay, well in Harlem I remember my cousins lived, my Uncle Donald, my father's brother lived in, two blocks down and he had four sons and one daughter.  And so that, and the daughter was the same age as my, my cousin, their daughter Juanita is the same age as my sister, so we would go there and visit Uncle Donald and so on.  And I remember happiness in Harlem.  I remember my mother use to walk us on Sunday morning up to Abyssinian Baptist Church.  We'd walk from my house all the way--we lived on 112th Street.  She would walk us all the way up to the church, which was like 137th or 38th [138th] Street.  And we also used to play in Morningside Park right nearby.  Friends, I remember that Mrs. Innis, Mr. Innis was, they were our neighbors on 110th Street.
Speaker 1: Roy Innis?
Speaker 2: No, no (laughter), no.
Speaker 1: Not that one, a different Innis.
Speaker 2: No, Mr. Innis was a seaman with my father [Jerald Sargent] and so the first address we lived at was on 110th Street and Mrs. Innis was white.  She was British, still talked with a British accent, and her husband was black, who was a, a merchant seaman with my father.  And so they became very, we always were very close to them and friends.  And their oldest daughter and then their two daughters used to babysit for my sister [Joan Sargent] and I, because my mother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent], as I told you was a dressmaker.  She didn't always work but she worked sometimes and then she stayed home sometimes.  So they took care of us and we, we lived above them.  And so it was a very convenient arrangement.  And I remember many happy days playing, going to Morningside Park and playing there and so on.  And on 112th Street, again, I was a New York City kid.  We played out in the street in front of our houses and jumped rope and all the things that kids do.  But I was seven, I was still pretty young and I couldn't go wonder far from the house at all.  And my grandmother came up; my stepmother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent]'s mother came up to live with us when we had moved to 112th Street.  We had a great big apartment and we were on the ground floor.  And cats, we use to have cats.  What happened is that one-day this cat decided to have her litter behind our kitchen door (laughter).  And I remember we couldn't even hardly walk in the kitchen without her getting crazy.  But we, the thrill of having the little baby kittens was really nice.  I don't remember too much more about it, except I remember there was still white families in Harlem because on the corner of our block we used to see this family with the tennis outfits and their tennis rackets jumping into the car to go away for the weekend, you know, or else to go play tennis.  It was a very peaceful time in New York City; it was not turmoil.  And walking down the streets, I used to go to the Schom [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York]...well, at the time it was just the Countee Cullen Library [New York, New York] there on 135th [sic, 136th] Street.  I remember getting a library card and to walk, there was no, I mean it was so easy to do that, you know.  116th Street was like a main drag.
Story_ID: 179630
Speaker 1: My father [Jerald Sargent] worked sporadically like, he would work for fourteen days and then he'd have, between jobs, he'd have some time.  And when he did that he would cook.  Now he, he, he liked his hot sauce, and he would buy the hot sauce like it was, which was very hot.  Then he'd bring it home and he would cook it and he would go under the railroad there, the Long Island [New York], the New Haven Railroad [New York, New Haven and Hartford] was a shopping market which was a good idea, we should do that again.  It was the Park Avenue Market, which had vegetables, fruits and everything.  You rented a booth from them and sold your wares.  So daddy would go there on his days off and he would gather his foods and plus he liked to cook and he use to make a dish with corn, spareribs and lima beans.  Now he only had two girls and a wife (laughter) and he would make enough for an army of people because he felt you had to make a lot, you know.  He couldn't make, cook in small quantities, but when he would enhance his hot sauce your eyes would water when you walked into the kitchen.  And when he'd taste it he'd have to put sugar on it, he'd put it in his mouth and he'd have to throw sugar on his tongue right away, for some reason I think it took the sting away.  But daddy was known for his hot sauce, and it was real hot.  But when we moved to the Bronx [New York] we had a Bathgate Avenue supermarket there, which was great.  It was Bathgate Avenue, and it was an open, an open-air market under apartment buildings.  We enjoyed being in the Bronx as children, we did.  And it was open.  We were near two parks between Crotona Park [Bronx, New York] and also Morrisania Park [Bronx, New York] and we used to play, we roller-skated.  I loved to roller skate.  And mama, and the further she wanted me to go on those roller skates I loved it.  So I would go all over.  And I used to skate from my house to Bronx Zoo [Bronx, New York].  And I was the oldest of three girls of my sister [Joan Sargent] and my cousin [Delores].  My cousin really became like my youngest sister.  She was three years younger than me.  And in those days the oldest had to responsibility.  And Delores, that was her name, my sister's name is Joan; we would go, all holidays Delores would spend with us because Auntie had to work.  And Auntee lived in Harlem on, on, on Amsterdam Avenue.  And, so Delores would spend holidays with us, she, all school holidays, she would spend many weekends with us.  And so that, and I was in charge.  And I felt very responsible and I was made to respond, be responsible.  And my mother would say, "You know, Helen, you carry the weight of the world on your shoulders."  Well, you know I thought about that because that is how I feel (laughter).  But I think it was a heavy load to lay on a kid, you know.  But I was responsible for those two girls and my, my daughter believes in the zodiac.  And you know Libra, I'm a Libra, September 30th is my birthday, and my husband [Donald Marshall] is October the 6th by the way, which is also Libra, which they claim is either a marriage made in heaven or forget about it.  So we've been married now for fifty-five years and so I guess it was made in heaven.  But, I did feel a real responsibility for my sister and my cousin and I felt always that I had to share things properly because that was my, that was a responsibility that was placed upon my shoulders, not such a bad responsibility though.  I find it helped me to be a mother.  It helped me to be a leader, and a fair leader.  So, I guess it was all right, I guess it was all right; it worked out.
Story_ID: 179631
Speaker 1: So your personality when you were growing up-- you were a little girl that had responsibilities (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --You had two other little girls to take care of.
Speaker 2: In addition to that, my mother [stepmother, Artemesor Hasty Sargent] had the asthma and for some reason my sister [Joan Sargent] by the way, was thin and paler.  She was paler than me.  I always, like my father [Jerald Sargent] use to call me his "little horse."  I was always, never fat, but I was healthy and vigorous and I never got sick.  I went through elementary school with one hundred percent attendance.  I got a medal for that you know, I got awarded for that.  But I was always very healthy.  And, where was I on that?  Oh, you talked about responsibility.  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yeah, your personality (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --My mother, well my mother had asthma, so she could not dust and she couldn't be in a dusty environment and my sister was--I was talking about my sister.  My sister [Joan Sargent] was thin, she was always thin and she was pale.  And my mother worried about her.  Actually my sister and I went through extensive testing when our real mother [Audrey McKenzie Sargent] died from tuberculosis.  But in fact, they kept my sister going longer than me because she was only a year old and she was in my mother's arms a lot.  But we were, we did not catch it.  Probably they got us away from her as quickly as possible as soon as it was diagnosed.  And that must have been traumatic for my sister and I and also for my mother and my father.  But at any rate, my stepmother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent] looked at my--and was, when my father married my stepmother, my sister was still pretty young.  I was all of four and she was you know, not much more than, she was a little bit more than, than a year old and so my stepmother kind of felt like she was sickly because she was thin.  And so my sister also, she did not want--and I wanted to protect my sister, I told you that.  And if there were chores to be done I would do them and I would do them very gladly and I use to do the dusting and by, by the time I was twelve, in fact, my mother--anybody who gave my mother some kind of formula for my sister to keep her healthy, you know, she would have to take and some of that, that stuff was awful.  But in those days my mother believed in a spring tonic.  Now the spring, and the spring tonic was a spoonful of sugar and they use to put like kerosene in it, okay.  And we took that, that was supposed to clean us out.  Don't get a cold, if you got a cold you had to take cod liver oil.  Which is, I said, I promised God that when I grow up I will, and I have children, I will never give them cod liver oil.  And my mother would have the orange right there.  You had to, you couldn't throw up now, you know, you, you couldn't throw up.  So you had, you had to swallow this stuff and we did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And then take a bite out an orange, or?
Speaker 2: --right after, oh you had to or else it was terrible.  It was awful.  And of course, I took cod liver oil in the morning, which was okay, I never minded that of course with the oranges, but my poor sister [Joan Sargent], and I just took those spring tonics and you know, if I got a cold I had to take the cod liver oil, cleanse you soul, cleanse your body out, but my sister, man, everybody would give my mother [stepmother, Artemesor Hasty Sargent] all these different crazy formulas and one of it came, it, it, it got gelled you know, and Joan was supposed to that this after school every day.  So the days that my mother worked it was my responsibility to make sure my sister took it, you know what we'd do with that.  Not only did we take out a spoonful, we took out a little more so there would be less of it (laughter) and throw it down the toilet bowl.  My sister was fine, but she was thin and my mother used to rub milk on her cheeks to make the, you know, to make her not look so peaked.  So my sister was handled that she could not do but so much and I even protected her because I didn't want her to die.  And when she went to have her tonsils out, oh, I thought she might die you know, and fortunately she didn't.  She just went to have her tonsils out.  She was a little pale and thin, but that's the sister who had, her first boy was nine pounds, the second was, was ten pounds and second was nine pounds and she had a series of miscarriages because my, my, they, my sister wanted to have a boy and my brother-in-law, they, my sister and brother-in-law wanted to have a boy, but she finally, a girl, so she finally gave birth to the daughter.  But she had a series of miscarriages and she lived through all of that.  She's fine, that's just how she looks.  She, she's taller and thinner and she's a little paler than me that's all.  But you know growing up you listen to what the adults say in those days.  And we didn't--the doctors, the level of medical care was different than it is today.  But, so between my sister and my mother, I learned a lot, I mean I learned how to do everything in the house, plus I sewed.  I like to sew.  I used to sew by hand.  And, well, that's kind of the background of our family--
Story_ID: 179632
Speaker 1: And one day like I told you, my stepmother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent] told us that she was not going--we, one day when we came home from school she was going to be gone.  And that day came.  We walked in the house; we could not believe what we saw.  She was really gone.  She took (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So she, did they split up or what--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, she just left.  She just walked away.  He [Jerald Sargent] didn't know that she had it all planned out but we had no idea, well except that she would tell me this, but I really didn't believe that she was going to do it.  So I came home from school, my sister [Joan Sargent] and I came home from school this day and mama was gone.  Now she already told me what to do.  She said, "One day you're going to come home from school and I'm going to be gone, and your father, when he comes in he's going to be very upset.  I want you to tell him the following, make sure he's sitting down and you say to him, 'Daddy, don't worry mama taught me how to do everything.  I know how to clean the house.  I know how to shop for food.  I know how to take care of everything.'"  And I had my hand on my father's shoulder and I felt his shoulder relax, okay.  But, he could only be but so relaxed because I'm twelve; I'm twelve at this point, about to become a young lady.  And in those days the men didn't raise the daughters, you know.  The women did that and so he was very concerned, and he had this one daughter who's becoming a young woman and my sister just two years behind me.  So he was a little worried about all of that.  But we made it through.
Speaker 2: What a responsibility.  So you had to tell your father that your, your stepmother left?
Speaker 1: Well he knew that.  I mean he came in and we, he said, we said, "Dad, mom is gone, you know."  But they did not have a good relationship, so to a certain extent, but he never thought that she would walk away.  Her, we did get in contact with her after that.  But she said she couldn't take us from my father because we were his and if she did it would kill him and that was true, that was true.  He always wanted to make sure that we were in a good, in a good, safe situation.  And even though the relationship with my mother-in-law, my stepmother was not positive, we had a good home.  We were well fed.  We were taken care of.  We were trained to do the right thing and so on and so forth.
Story_ID: 179633
Speaker 1: Let's go to school and you started school when you were, you are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In Harlem [New York, New York](simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --in Harlem (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --yeah, right, across the street at the little elementary school.  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Where did you start, which, which one was it?
Speaker 2: That was, oh, I don't remember the number of that school.  For some reason P.S. 7 [Milton Fein School, Bronx, New York] comes to mind, but I don't know if that was the school, but it was like right across the street from us.  I tried to go back there, you know, to see where, if the school is still there, or if it's not still there.  And I don't remember what I was able to ascertain.  But (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: So when you moved though, you went to the Bronx [New York]?
Speaker 2: When we moved we moved to the Bronx and I went to P.S. 042 [Claremont] in the Bronx.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And well, did, what was that like, and did you like school?
Speaker 2: I liked going to school, yes.  I did like going to school.  Sometimes the teachers, we had the old fashioned teachers, you know, who were very, very strict.  Here and there you would get one that was not so strict, but even in school there was racial overtones.  Now for instance, while I was in school the war broke out and in school we had to--that's when I learned about military discipline you know.  No questions asked; you followed instructions and so on.  We had to go sit in the--well, they first of all had to give us little identification tags so that if we died or if we got separated from our families they would know who we were.  And so my little tag had, I still have the tag.  It had my name, my date of birth, my, my nationality, which was in those days Negro or colored, I think, one or the other.  And we had to wear them at all times.  But in the classroom when the teacher was telling, was instructing us on how to fill-out this little card that would put, would transfer, from which the transfer, the information for the little tag would be developed.  There was three black kids in the class in those days.  We didn't call ourselves black.  By the way, by the way, my father said, "You are not Negro."  He said, "Negro is a term that the white man gave you."  He said, "I'm a," he's a painter, he said, "black encompasses all colors and white is the absence of all colors," okay.  And, and plus I learned later on in Europe and that boat that he was on, they only used black and white.  They never used these other terms, okay.  I found that out later on being examined by a doctor who was either, he was some Slavic kind of doctor and he asked me, "Did you associate with blacks?", you know.  Now of course my color is very fair--
Story_ID: 179634
Speaker 1: My color is very fair so there were times when I would overhear things that were very painful, okay.  There were times when questions were asked of me.  This is full acknowledgment of the fact that I'm black.  But that--even the teacher when it came to writing out the information for the tags, she had me go up and write on the board, "colored."  She had Harold Russell, who I still know 'till today, he went up and wrote on the board, "Negro."  So we could choose whichever one we wanted to be called, you know.  And colored was the general accepted term then.  Many of the teachers in those days were so darn strict; they were so strict.  They were even, they were strict to all the kids, and many times they didn't even have patience with the, the white kids in my group who came from immigrant parents, you know what I mean.  Well, graduation time came and I'm in front of the mirror and I'm saying my, I'm singing the songs and practicing for the graduation and during that--and my mother [Artemesor Hasty Sargent] heard me singing 'Ole Black Joe', okay, without saying a word to me she went to school and she, she and a lady named Mrs. Snipe [ph.], who I later learned was my, my husband's aunt, he was staying with her, but I never knew him through all of this, but I knew of her daughter, Phyllis, was in my class and Mrs. and Harold Russell's grandmother came to school and they said, "They are not going to sing that song at graduation, in fact no child is going to sing that song at graduation, it will only humiliate these children."
Speaker 2: And what school was that?
Speaker 1: P.S. 042 in the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 2: Okay, alright--
Speaker 1: Claremont Parkway--
