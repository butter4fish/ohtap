 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Monday, April 21, 2008. I am in Stillwater, Oklahoma  interviewing Ada Whitley. This interview is being conducted as part of  O-STATE Stories, an oral history project of the OSU Library. Thank you  for joining us today. Let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you.  Can you tell us where you grew up and give us a little background on  your early life?  Well, I grew up in Oklahoma. I went to public schools at a small town in  Muskogee County called Oktaha. I went all twelve years, and I played  sports. We didn   t have a lot to do other than that. Then I graduated in  1947   that kind of tells my age   and went to Connors Junior College  for one year. Then I went to Northeastern State University at Tahlequah  and I got my bachelor   s there. I majored in physical education and  business. I played on sports teams there. They were short seasons,  intramural type, and we also did sports days, so we did compete against  other colleges, but that is the way I began. Then I came to OSU in 1961  and I stayed until I retired in 1988.  Now what brought you to OSU?  Well, number one, I was going to major, do my master   s in basically  health and physical education and it was a good school. I always liked  Oklahoma State. I came from a county that had a lot of people that went  to OU  University of Oklahoma , but I preferred Oklahoma State.  Now when you were growing up, what were some of your favorite  sports? You played a lot, but what were some of your favorites?  Well, my favorites would have to be mainly basketball. When I was  young, I played basketball and softball. We played full schedule  basketball in high school, and in fact they started back in the elementary  5  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  grades and junior high, so it was a big deal at small schools in the state.  Now at that time, there were no large schools that played girls     basketball. There was just the boys    basketball for many years. I don   t  know exactly when they started, but we started competing like when we  were like fifth grade.  Now after you received your master   s from OSU, what did you end up  doing?  Well, actually, my main movement was between my bachelor   s and my  master   s. After I finished my master   s here I started teaching. I was  hired as an instructor in the fall after I graduated in the summer. I taught  activity classes. I was in charge of the women   s intramural program,  which Oklahoma State has had a good intramural program, probably  from the beginning. I coached some of the club sports, but I guess we   ll  get into that a little bit later?  Yes. Now what sports were offered as part of women   s intramurals back  then?  Well, the team sports were basketball, softball, volleyball, field hockey,  and all the team sports. Do you want to know about the individual  sports?  Sure, you bet.  I may not list them all, but we had tennis, badminton, fencing, table  tennis, bowling, and golf. We did all of them and we competed in  divisions. We had a sorority division, a residence hall division, and an  independent, so it was pretty big business. We also, in team sports, we  played flag football. In the 1970s, we would have probably between 45  and 50 flag football teams for women. So there was a lot of activity.  Were there a lot of women who were interested in participating in the  sport programs?  Yes.  And tell me about some of the facilities where you all played.  For intramurals, we were in Gallagher Hall. That   s where our offices  were, and there was a small classroom there. But activity classes, we had  what they call the old gym, and it   s the Architecture Building. There was  a gymnasium in there, there was a swimming pool, there was a running  track up above, and we had classes there. Actually, it was either the old  gym or Gardiner Hall. Of course some of the classes went outside, but  6  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  they had a meeting room in Gardiner Hall.  And then for fencing or basketball or flag football, where would you  play?  Well, now when we were doing the flag football we had moved to the  Colvin Center. And this was early, like probably 1961 to 1963 or so we  used those other facilities I mentioned, but of course there were fields  around the Colvin Center for the outdoor sports. Then there were plenty  of courts inside. And golf, there was a classroom plus out on the north  campus there were what we called intramural fields at one time, and  there was a place for golf and that type of thing.  And bowling?  Yeah, we used the bowling alley at the Student Union.  And where was that located?  Down in the basement. It   s long gone now, I believe.  How many lanes, do you remember?  I think there were eight lanes down there, because we also taught  bowling classes. That   s where they were taught.  Now you played a big role in basketball here as a club sport. Tell me  about how you got involved in coaching women   s basketball.  Well, I want to back up a little bit. What I did actually between my  bachelor   s and my master   s, I taught ten years. I taught in Oklahoma and  Kansas. My first teaching job I was actually hired as a basketball coach  and that was in Barnsdall, Oklahoma. And you can imagine how much I  knew about coaching right out of college. I did play college basketball at  Northeastern, but it was very few games. And I   ll get into the sports  days and things like that a little later, but that was actually my  experience. I had played as a youth. I had played intramurals in college.  Of course, at Barnsdall I coached basketball plus I taught some business  classes. I had a business major. But I didn   t know a whole lot about it.  We   ll put it that way. (Laughs)  Now was that high school?  That was high school.  Okay. And when they hired you to coach, did you think    Oh no,    or  7  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  what did you do to prepare yourself?  No. I wanted to do it, and I knew when I went that was one of my main  jobs. The only big problem was the coach before was my boss, the  superintendent. (Laughter) Keeping him from trying to tell me how to  run it was a little bit tricky. In fact, one time he came in and watched a  little while and he had a suggestion doing something, and I didn   t say  anything, you know. I just went ahead and did what I wanted to. But  then after that session was over, I did go to the office and I said,    Okay,  either you   re going to coach this, or I   m going to coach it.    And I guess  that was one of my first encounters. He did leave me alone after that, but  he probably thought, and he was probably right, that I didn   t know what  I was doing.  Did you have a mentor to guide you through those early years?  Not really. I had teachers and coaches that I liked when I was playing in  high school, but I didn   t really have anyone I would consider a mentor.  Who were some of those coaches that you looked up to in the high  school ranks?  Well, there was a man by the name Eyland Rainwater that was at the  same school where I said I went for twelve years. He wasn   t there the  whole length of time, but he was a good coach and a good motivator,  and we liked to win, but we played a lot for fun. Some of the people that  got to play wouldn   t be playing today, because of skills, you know.  And did you ever play against Bertha Teague?  No. But of course we all knew Bertha Teague. There was a lot of history  there. We   ve known about Bertha Teague. They had what they called the  Bertha Teague Classic for a while. And the state schools played in that. I  don   t remember exactly, Oklahoma  University of Oklahoma  always  played in that, and so did OSU. Incidentally, back in the early days,  OSU fans will be glad to know, I don   t think we ever were defeated,  during the early years (Laughing) by OU.  That   s good to know. Now during your years coaching, between your  bachelor   s and your master   s     I only coached between my bachelor   s and my master   s just the two  years at Barnsdall.  Do you remember your record?  8  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  No. I don   t. I   ve been asked that before, and you know everybody now  keeps all the records of everything. I remember certain games and  things. We had a good team, but we didn   t have a championship team.  But when we left, when we moved   you know back then it wasn   t too  important, and you just tossed your scorebooks along with the other junk  when you moved on to a different place.  What motivated you to go on and get a master   s degree?  Well, I had an older sister that actually did that, and I guess my thought  was probably to go ahead and do it anyway because I just believed in  education. I enjoyed school. I had a good time. I think college years are  probably your best years. My sister had her doctorate, and my dad saw  her go through that, and he said    Oh, you don   t need one.    (Laughs) So I  wasn   t inspired to go any farther than that.  Now tell me about how you got involved coaching the club team at OSU.  Okay. We had an organization in all of the colleges, or I think in the  state and all around the country, had what they called the Women   s  Recreation Association, and it was WRA. It was actually student run.  They had officers, and their main responsibility was to work with all of  the intramural sports and oversee those. Also, we had state sports days,  and they were in charge of organization on that part, but there were  teams. We had a basketball sports day, we had volleyball, we had all of  those, and then we had individual sports. And that   s where all of the  colleges in the state would meet at a certain school and they played  games. They would have shortened games because they would play     let   s take basketball for instance   they would play two or three games in  one day. So actually, when we started, that was the main way that we got  with other schools. It would kind of be a long day, but it was a fun day.  The way we got our teams, you just put the notice in The O   Colly, and  we had intramurals   we   ll talk about basketball   we had intramurals  during that time and we   d put notices up and the people that were  interested in trying out for the team would come out. You could, if you  were a good athlete and wanted to participate in more than one thing,  these sports days were seasonal. Our season was short. Like at the  beginning of the school year, there   d be field hockey. Then, like  midterm, they would put the announcement out for volleyball. After  Christmas, we started basketball, so there was no long term. The  students that we got that tried out, they all came from little schools. They  had a lot of talent, their fundamentals were good, but they just wanted to  play longer. We would practice about two weeks before we started  playing anything, so we didn   t have a lot of time to work up a whole lot  of plays and things. We just used good fundamentals and did the short  9  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  term thing. In other words, they could handle the ball and they could hit  the goal, and those were the two main things.  We would go to the sports day and play those two or three games, and  then we would have several games that might be home and away or we  might have a school that would come to OSU and play. But actually our  whole season, during any of those sports, the most would probably be  twelve games. So it was get in there and do that, have fun, win what you  win. Then when the season was over, if you wanted to go out for the  next one   which would be softball or it might be track and field   but  that   s the way it actually started.  And how did they decide which schools would host sport days?  What they did, they had like a business meeting once a year, where all of  the faculty or whoever was sponsoring the Women   s Recreation  Association, they would get together and set up schedules. Schools  would say, like Oklahoma State might say we   d like to the volleyball  that year. And if another school wanted to do it, they   d go ahead and  take a vote and see who got to do it. But they   d pass these around.  Something else on that order, we always had teams. Every school fielded  teams because that was really the only special opportunity that women  got to participate in the sports, other than the intramural program. These  teams were coached by the women   s physical education teachers. Guess  how much they were paid?  Tell me about that.  Zero. (Laughter) It was part of their assignment. It was coaches that  were interested in that sport. They had quite a few physical education  majors, so they wanted them to have the opportunity to play on teams if  they were good enough to make it. Most of the players came from the  small schools. They were as good as they could be, and once again don   t  ask our record, but we won most of our games. In other words, we had  enough talent, but we had All-Staters that might be playing. And we   d  spot people in intramurals and would ask if they   d like to come out and  play for the varsity team. Sometimes they   d say yes, and sometimes  they   d say they were burned out, they   d played too much in high school.  That   s actually the way this ran.  For transportation, we used school vehicles when we first started, like in  1961. Now a lot of people think that   s when basketball here started,  basketball teams. That   s not true. Women   s basketball goes back   I   ve  seen pictures where they wore the bloomers. And I had heard, I don   t  know whether it   s factual or not, but there was a women   s basketball  team on the OSU, which was OAMC  Oklahoma Agricultural and  10  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Mechanical College  campus, before the men   s.  That is true.  And I had heard that. I tell you, we had a real strong physical education  department. And we had a strong leader in the state, Valerie Colvin that  the Colvin Center is named after. Central State also had an outstanding  lady that was in charge of their department. Her name was Emma  Plunkett. Then OU had Maureen Bowling. They were really leaders in  the state, and they wanted to make sure that they had good physical  education programs and also activity for the girls. See, back when I  came, physical education was required. Everybody that was enrolled, all  females, had to have four hours of physical education. And the last  group to drop that rule was the Home Ec Department. Let   s see, we also,  during those early games, we had to furnish referees. In other words, the  referees that we took would not officiate our games. They were trained.  They were students or faculty. I don   t believe that there was any  compensation for that. It was just a learning experience.  What about uniforms?  Oh yeah, that   s good too. We had uniforms for the physical education  classes, and it was black shorts and a white shirt, just cotton shirts. That  was used for quite a few years in the 1960s. They didn   t have numbers  or anything. What they had     have you ever heard of pinnies?  No.  P-I-N-N-I-E-S. Well what they are, they   re like a bib that has a number  on the front and a number on the back, and they snap. Anyway, that   s  what we were wearing. And then finally, I talked with one of my former  players, and I said what do you remember about the basketball, and she  said,    I remember those old         we had some warm-ups a little later  on, I   d say in the late    60s, but they had to be passed around to each  team. When they got through one season they   d be washed or cleaned or  whatever and then go to the next team. She said,    I remember those old  baggy warm-ups.    And they were black with, of course, the orange trim.  And she said,    I also remember having to share a volleyball top with  another person.    We didn   t have enough. In other words, volleyball  would be playing, they would get the uniforms when we finally got  uniforms, but they had to be through with them by the time basketball  started or they would schedule different days, so they   d have to wash  those in between. That was the way the uniforms actually started. They  were uniforms, but they weren   t what we think of today.  Now going back to sport days, who were all the Oklahoma schools that  11  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  were involved?  I would say most of the schools. The state schools were the main ones.  TU  Tulsa University  would participate some, but it was basically OU,  OSU, and then Northeastern, Northwestern, Central State, all of those,  and they all participated. Now our biggest problem when we did play  some, and we   d think, well let   s go play a junior college, they were  playing full schedules, and that   s when we had trouble, because they had  been practicing. They practiced the whole year. They played just a  regular schedule like they play today, but that was back in the 1960s.  But we didn   t compete, the larger schools and the smaller schools, they  were just all in the same pool. And the larger schools didn   t necessarily  win the thing. They usually came out, even though we played lesser  games and shorter halfs.  One thing I wanted to say on the referees, and I will talk about the  organizations, how they graduated down. We did have national referees  during this time. Anybody that wanted to be a national referee, they had  a book they could use to study for an exam. They had state examiners.  They were made up of faculty members that had gone through all of this.  And they could get a national   you may have heard of DGWS, Division  of Girls and Women   s Sports. It was one of the organizations. They  could get a national official   s license. Instead of just wearing the striped  shirt, you had that national emblem on. So they worked on all the  phases, but everything was short term.  I want to say something about where did we play. The first few years,  probably three or so, we played in the old gym. One of the basketball  players used to come over and watch the girls when they  the boys   weren   t practicing. And he worked with the post players. He asked me  one day,    Can I work with your post players?    He was a post player. His  name was James King. Anyway, I appreciated it because I wasn   t an  expert at post players. And of course the girls really enjoyed having  somebody on the men   s team that took an interest in them.  Did a lot of people show up for the games or was it just     Small, just small. Back towards the rules, when I first came here in  1961, we played just like the regular high school rules. It   s the six on  six, and they didn   t cross the half line. And the high schools played that  for many, many years. Then in 1965, we went to what   s called the rover.  It was six players on the team, but four could be across the line. Like in  high school, if you were across the line, the other team got it out. You  didn   t have to say,    Okay, I   m going to be a rover,    but any time the ball  went down to your goal, four players would cross over, so there would  be four left. I mean two of each team, but it was called a roving player,  12  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  and it was really a good game. And they played that until about 1968, I  think, is when the college started playing the five on five like they play  today.  It started out with the Women   s Recreation Association, and then we  had what was called the Oklahoma Athletic and Recreation Federation  for College Women, OARFCW. And that had a national organization  that was called the Athletic and Recreation Federation for College  Women and they had national conferences. This was a leadership type  thing and this is where the state organized what they were going to play  and when, when they   d get to get together for the state meetings. I took  students to North Carolina that were officers in WRA. That was really a  good group, and then after that was DGWS, that   s the Division of Girls  and Women   s Sports. And then it   s AIAW, and that   s the Association of  Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. That was the one that proceeded  NCAA  National Collegiate Athletic Association . So that was kind of  the way that it evolved.  Lot of changes in the governing bodies.  Lots of changes, yes.  Well tell me about how, I   m going to assume sports days did not last.  Well, they were played many, many years, but when they started playing  competitions where they had a full schedule, those went out.  And about what year?  I would say it would have been in the 1960s. Probably close to 1970, I  would say.  And so how did you handle scheduling at that point, because now you   re  on full schedules.  Right. Actually they just set them up, who they wanted to play. Of  course now with the conference, you know the Big XII sets up that, and  then the Athletic Department sets up other games that are played.  Basically, the coaches decide who they want to play, and if they can play  them.  Now during your tenure as coach, did you ever have trouble finding  players?  Not really. One told me one day, said,    I did come out one year, but you  were a little short. I didn   t get to play much, that   s probably the only  13  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  reason I made the team.    But usually we had plenty, because sports are  one thing people like to continue if they can. They don   t like to have to  stop just because they go to school or go to work or something.  Was it tough finding time for practices while juggling your teaching  load?  I tell you what, it didn   t matter. We taught a full load of whatever we  were teaching, and this was just on the side. Yes, you were very, very  busy. These two ladies that I mentioned, Ms. Colvin and the one from  Central, they didn   t think that you should have any extra time. That was  just part of the job, and when you would say,    I   m teaching too many  classes. I can   t do all this,    they didn   t much agree with you. They just  left you. It would be interesting. I might teach maybe seven classes, and  they would be Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday. I  know there was a big change in the number of classes that they teach  today. If they teach three, they think that   s more than enough. But they  grew up that way, building a program, and they only had so many people  to do it. They just thought it wouldn   t hurt. It   s what you should do.  Now did Valerie Colvin hire you out of your master   s program?  Yes. Actually, she was on the committee. I never had her in a class. The  ones that I had with my graduate work, I guess they thought I could do  this, and I didn   t know the difference. I did come to OSU. I was teaching  in Muskogee   Alice Robertson Junior High. I actually came for a cut,  to come to OSU. My thought was, I   ll get in and I   ll go up. It   s easier to  get it before you get in.  And what do you remember most about Ms. Colvin?  Well, she was quite a go-getter. She was a ruler, we   ll put it that way.  She worked hard. She did a good job. I remember telling her one time,  she said,    Well, we   ve always done this,    and I remember telling her,     Well, just because you   ve always done it, we don   t have to continue it.     But I was trying to get out of some extra class or some something. She  was one the starters of all the physical education in the area.  Do you remember the first game you ever coached here at OSU?  No. It was so near like what I was doing, working with intramurals and  all this and that. There was a lot of camaraderie between the college  instructors in the state. In fact, for many, many years, we got together  once a year at a camp down on like Lake Murray or somewhere like that  just for fun. So we were close and still see each other and do some  things, but it was really a good relationship among all of them. There  14  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  wasn   t rivalry until you stepped out on the court, and then of course  everybody liked to win.  So just so we have it on record, what years did you serve as coach of the  women   s team?  Okay, 1961 is when I came and started, and 1972 was the last year that I  coached. Jacy Showers came after me.  So you   ve had the opportunity to interact with lots of players during  your time.  Yes.  Any standout from those early years?  Well, I tell you what, one of the biggest thrills for me was when we  played OU this year  2007  in basketball and filled Gallagher-Iba   Arena . I don   t know whether you were there or not, but that was  amazing. That   s something that I didn   t know whether we would ever  see. I thought it was about time, but several of the players that played  back during that time were there to see that. They were just thrilled how  far they have come from their uniforms, what we used to wear is the  pinnies and this and that, up to where they are today.  What a great atmosphere that was.  Oh, that was wonderful. In fact, I talked with a couple of friends that  have recently retired from UCO, Central State to me, and they were  there. I think both of them got their doctorates here. They did graduate  work here, and they just thought that was just the most fun they had ever  seen. And it was. It was really because the ones that had played  basketball   these two had not played   but this one girl, I think she  played around 1974 or 1975, somewhere in there, but she said that was  just amazing. There were quite a few of the old timers that came back  and saw that. But who would have thought? That was exciting.  Now do you still hear from some of your former players?  Well, yes I do, some. There are very few that come back. The Cowgirls  have a Cowgirl reunion, but there will be one or two that will come back  every now and then. Most of them are teaching or by now they could be  retired.  Were you ever able to play or practice in Gallagher?  15  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  No. I don   t think they started in Gallagher until maybe Judy Bugher  came. But we played our games over in the Colvin Center in what they  called the double gym and before that, we played our games in the old  gym. Just a little sideline that has nothing to do with basketball, but  talking about intramurals earlier, we had volleyball courts on the tennis  courts. We used to have eight tennis courts over there by the  Architecture Building, the old gym, and they played on both sides of the  building. Every day at a certain time during volleyball season, they  would put up a volleyball net. There would be eight games going at  once, but they played outside. There would be maybe 60 teams that were  playing, but they were played outside on the tennis courts, the  volleyball. But our facilities are a lot better now.  Was the campus very supportive during your 11 years? Was there a lot  of support outside of health and physical education?  Most of it went towards the men   s basketball program, and I don   t think  they really cared too much. I   m sure they wouldn   t have wanted to let  them over to Gallagher too much earlier than what they got over there.  I   m not sure that the forerunners, like Ms. Colvin   s group, really thought  it was necessary. They probably thought the sports days and intramurals  and that type of thing were good enough, that they would gain just as  much. They definitely wouldn   t want them to miss a lot of class to go to  the games and play like competition is today.  Did you think it was at an acceptable level?  Well I guess I did at the time, because it was basically recreation. There  were no other big schools or even four-year schools in the state that were  playing competitively. So I didn   t give it a whole lot of thought. I was  glad when they did have teams, but I wasn   t in the picket line or  anything.  Now during your 11 years, are there any key moments that just stand out  for you, that you just think, wow it   s really great to be a coach?  I think a coach is a teacher. I think it   s great to be a teacher. I think they  learn a lot if they do play in a sport. I think it gets peoples    interest that  maybe wouldn   t be interested in going to school at all. You know, a lot  of good things have happened, but I can   t just specifically say. I enjoyed  what I did. I   m a firm believer that if you   re not happy at work, you need  to change jobs. I can   t think of anything worse than having to go to work  every day just to get that paycheck. I   ve enjoyed all of my jobs. I   ve  enjoyed OSU. I enjoy retirement. I really wouldn   t do it any other way.  Now in 1971, you were kind of at a crossroads with the basketball  16  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  program.  Right.  Tell me about that.  Well, they were beginning to get   I guess the smaller schools were  beginning to play more, probably, than the larger schools, as far as  women   s basketball. But there came to a time that Title IX was one of  the main things. They had an opportunity to get money to participate.  There are always people that would like to. And what   s fair for one is  only fair for the other. I just thought, I   ve coached; I   ve coached in high  school and I coached, not long seasons, but I coached, and as I said  coaching I think is teaching. I thought well, I don   t know that I want  to   I had to do one or the other. And I had been in the field long enough  that I was ready to slow down a little bit instead of this getting out and  having to recruit and raise money and that kind of thing. And in fact,  Jacy Showers came up to me, I guess probably about the last year and  she said,    Hey, if you   re tired of the basketball, I would take it.    So she  kind of asked for it and I couldn   t do both, because it was a full-time job.  And then of course basketball now is a full-time job. It didn   t take me  long to decide that I had been there and done that. I just didn   t want to  do more. I couldn   t do both. And I   m glad that I went the way that I did,  because I wouldn   t have had time to come over here today, if I were  coaching. But I really believe in women   s sports. I really like it, and I  want to see it played right. I enjoy it, but I know enough about the game  to know when the referees miss something or the action of the coach or  the players. I   m glad to have the opportunity. There are some amazing  athletes out there. Some are going to college because of it that probably  could never have gone.  Now was Coach Showers on the faculty of Health and Physical  Education?  Yes, yes. She hadn   t been there but maybe a year when she told me she  would like to have the team. As I said, actually, the intramurals and  recreation area   and what I did, I also worked with noncredit classes at  the Colvin Center before I retired, and they were actually under Student  Services at that time. So they were making a change. It used to all be in  the academic area, and then after they got the building and so forth over  there that went into a recreation area. In other words, I would have had  different bosses according to what I was doing.  And were you involved with the basketball program after you     17  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Whitley  Nykolaiszyn  Retired?  Yes.  Well, I went to a lot of the games when Judy Bugher came. I took trips  with them some when they traveled. It was just starting, and they needed  all the help they could get. But I did travel with them some then, just for  the fact, I wasn   t helping much, but we happened to become friends and  there was a spare seat on the bus.  I do appreciate your time today, and if there   s anything else you   d like  to say, any final comments?  No, I think that that   s about it.  All right, well thank you very much.  -------  -------
