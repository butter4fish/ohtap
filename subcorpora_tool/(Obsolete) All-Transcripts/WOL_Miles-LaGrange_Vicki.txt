Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Today is November 5, 2007. I am here at the Oklahoma History Center.  My name is Tanya Finchum and this is part of the OSU Library   s oral  history program called Women of the Oklahoma Legislature. I   m here  with Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange, who served in the Senate from    86  until   93, and you only left then to become     The United States Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma.  Appointed by     President Clinton.  Thank you for joining me today.  Thank you for having me. This is a wonderful project.  We   ll start with having you tell a little about your childhood; where you  were born and then we   ll move on up.  I was born here in Oklahoma City. I was born in a then-segregated  hospital in Northeast Oklahoma City. It was called Edwards Hospital.  Now it   s a nursing home. The building is still there   it   s Edwards  Redeemer Nursing Center. I lived in a community east of Interstate-35  around Northeast 23rd Street called Edwards Addition. My parents had  relocated to Oklahoma City right after the birth of my older sister, my  only sister, in 1950. They came to a community, a brand-spanking new  edition, called Edwards Addition. Mr. Edwards had built this edition of  new homes. It was probably one hundred percent occupied by African-  American families, little five-room houses   two bedrooms, one bath, a  living room, dining room and a kitchen, a backyard and a fence. So  that   s where I grew up.  5  I have one sister who is three years older than me. Her name is Gayle  Miles-Scott and she is a retired professor of accounting at the University  of Central Oklahoma. It was my mom, my dad, my sister and I. Life was  great growing up as a kid. My parents are so wonderful, and they are  still living. My mom is eighty-seven and her name is Mary Lou Grenard  Miles and my dad   s name is Charles Clifford Miles. Dad   s eighty-five.  They are both retired educators. My dad is from Fairfax, Oklahoma, and  my mother is from a little town called Buford, Georgia. They met in a  little town called Gainesville, Georgia, when my dad, after the war, had  gone to what used to be called Hampton Institute. It is a historically  black college in Hampton, Virginia. He had gone there in the forties     late thirties, early forties. But his education got interrupted by the war  and he was sent to World War II. Then he came back and finished his  degree at Hampton.  After he graduated, the United States Navy sent him to a little town  called Gainesville, Georgia to run a technical school for quote,    colored  veterans,    in this little town. And this school was next door to a high  school where my mother was a teacher. She was the little girl from  Buford who was down the road at Gainesville. They have some funny  stories about how they met. He was actually trying to ask another  teacher out for a date and the little kid took the note to my mother and  she accepted. They are going on about sixty or so years this year.  They   ve been married for a long, long time. They are in Oklahoma.  My mother was a teacher at Garden Oaks Elementary School which is in  a little edition next to Edwards. It   s farther east than the Edwards  Addition is. And then my dad taught at Douglass. He was an industrial  arts teacher. He started teaching the year before I was born, 1952. As  educators, that  education  was the most important thing to them for my  sister and me. That was the one thing they always preached to us. They  said,    Get that, nobody can take that away from you. Get it for yourself,  nobody has to take care of you. You   ll always be able to be independent  if you can think for yourself and if you have your education.    That is  just what was drilled into our heads, so that   s what we did.  I was born in 1953. Both my parents got their master   s degrees from the  University of Oklahoma in 1955. And you had Brown v. the Board of  Education in    54 in Kansas. The University of Oklahoma had the Sipuel  Case   Ada Louis Sipuel Fisher   s case, and that was 1948. That   s still  kind of a close proximity. So for me they were trailblazers. As I got  older I appreciated all of that. My mother got her master   s in English  and my dad got his master   s in industrial arts. I seem to remember that  whole graduation experience, but I was just two, surely I don   t  remember that. Maybe it   s all the stories they   ve told me, because they  said I was running all around at the graduation and everybody was  6  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  picking me up and stuff (Laughs). I do remember, maybe   And life was good. My parents were always very encouraging to my  sister and myself. There was just absolutely nothing that I thought I  couldn   t do. And I know it was because of them, you know. Whatever  tiny little thing we did they just told us how wonderful it was. If I could  imagine it, my mother always made me believe it could happen. That  was good. That was the Miles household.  How did you get interested in being an attorney then? Early on?  Really early on, probably I was interested in government earlier than  being a lawyer. And then all of these people I held in high regard in  government also happened to be lawyers, so that seemed to me to be the  thing to do, whether I ever practiced or not. In elementary school, I have  a strong recollection of what my favorite classes were. I always would  have one teacher for all the classes in elementary school. But I loved  civics, I loved social studies. And you get up in junior high and they call  it government, history, social studies. But I loved those courses.  And I can remember being at Garden Oaks Elementary School, and this  would have had to been 1960 or 1961. I was in second grade. And John  Kennedy was elected President. I have such a recollection of that. And  for us in our family, because our parents were teachers back then, if they  were home by five o   clock and we were all home, we ate dinner  together. And the TV was always on. We ate dinner and watched the  news together. The news was always on the television as we ate. And I  wrote a letter to President Kennedy and I was telling him how, so this  had to be 1960, he won in 1960. Was it    60? I think. And I wrote him.  Do you remember the paper we used to have in elementary school,  where the lines are at the bottom and you draw a picture at the top? And  I drew a picture of him at the top, (Laughs) I thought it was a picture of  him, that   s what he looked like to me. And I wrote him this letter and I  was telling him how very happy I was that he was elected President.  Now you   ve got to remember what else was going on at the time. You  had the Bull Conners of the world, that stuff, those six o   clock news  were very prominent in the sixties of, you know all the race relations  struggle in America, the civil rights stuff, Dr. King. And I was a  convention kid. I   m a Baptist, a Missionary Baptist, so I grew up as a  convention kid, going to the conventions. Dr. King   s church was in the  same convention that my church was in, so I saw Dr. King as a child, all  the time, at the convention. He was an icon for us, of course.  But I wrote this letter to President Kennedy. Well I got a letter back.  Now of course   and I got that letter on my wall at the courthouse, or it  7  may be at home. It was 1961, so it must have been in 1961 that I wrote  the letter because the election would have been in November of    60. It  says,    The White House,    and the postage stamp on it is four cents. And  of course it   s not signed by President Kennedy, it   s signed by some guy  named John Duggan, Special Assistant to the President, and it   s like  about all of one sentence, you know,    The President received your letter,  he appreciates your ideas, and thank you very much for writing,    so I  took the letter to school and we had an assembly about my letter   (Laughs) I was so excited to hear from the President of the United  States.  And I liked the Kennedy   s. I liked Mrs. Kennedy. As a youngster I liked  him, the President, his family. And I can remember when Robert  Kennedy came to Oklahoma City to dedicate   I don   t know how you  un-dedicate a school, that   s always very curious, but there used to be a  John F. Kennedy Junior High School over here on Martin Luther King.  When Robert Kennedy came to dedicate that school, there was a man  from one of the large paving companies   I used to read the newspaper  as a kid, I   m telling you, I liked the news, I liked the newspaper, I liked  current events. And I remember saying to my mom that Robert Kennedy  was going to be here and did she think I could meet him. And I had  scrapbooks. I mean, I had four scrapbooks of the Kennedy   s that I had  made. A lot of LIFE magazines, you know LIFE magazine was  physically a big large magazine   I had all these cutouts. My mom said,     Well, we   ll see.    It was one of the paving companies here at the time.  But anyway my mother contacted them, because there was a little article  in the paper, and he said,    Well, if you all get the scrapbook here to my  office, I   m going to go and be meeting him in the limousine.    Of course,  he didn   t offer to take me along, darn  (Laughs) So momma and I went  traipsing up there to take the scrapbook and sure enough, he wrote me a  nice little message, and I   ve got that scrapbook today. So that was kind  of my first, I was about seven then.  And then I had a good friend growing up, one of my best friends   a boy  named Charles Atkins. He is the son of Hannah Atkins and the late Dr.  Charles Atkins. I think we were leaving the sixth grade going to the  seventh grade because by then Charles was at Casady and I was at F. D.  Moon Junior High School. My school building is still remaining today.  There is a building just east of Dean A. McGee Eye Institute and that is  the physical building where I went to Moon Junior High School for  seventh, eighth, and ninth grades. And Charles    mother, Hannah Atkins,  she was a librarian and was going to run for the Oklahoma House of  Representatives. And so Mrs. Atkins called me and said,    Vicki, I want  you to put together a group called    Hannah   s Helpers   .    And I said,     Great  What are we to do?    She said,    I want you all to get out there  and campaign for me. And I want you to just do your thing. You can get  8  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  you some little uniforms.    Do you remember that shocking hot sixties  lime green and that blue that was bluer than these curtains, like a hot  blue? We had these blue and green little dresses and they had little fringe  on them and we wore these little top hats with her name on them, we had  bumper stickers around them. And we did, we went door to door  campaigning and when she went places there was a cadre of about ten to  fifteen of Charles    friends, so we were a bunch of sixth and seventh  graders. We would hand out literature, do balloons. It was fun, it was  fun. So when she won, we were just beside ourselves, because we knew  that we were the reason why she won this office.  So that for me was more of the same, putting me further into what I  really love. Because I love people. I love people and I like trying to  convince people of things. And so that   s what that was all really about,  telling why we thought Mrs. Atkins would be good to represent us. And  sure enough she was. She was elected to the  Oklahoma  House of  Representatives, and I believe the first African-American female elected  to the House of Representatives and her career just blossomed from  there. What was the question I was answering? I have just been rambling  on.  You   re right where I   m at, though; you were the first African-American  Senate     State senator. Oh, and in junior high, I ran for the first time for president  of the Student Council, and I won  I was just beside myself. We had  more things going on at F. D. Moon Junior High School that year. I liked  everyone being a part of stuff, you know. Part of my little platform was  to get everyone participating in something extra rather than just  attending school. As you grow older, you wonder why didn   t so-and-so  participate in something, maybe they didn   t have the extra dollar or two  dollars for the fee and you may not have been sensitive to those things  then. But we really had a good student council.  Then I ran for Inner-City Student Council President and that was student  council. There was a student council for all of the junior high schools in  the city. And I won the president of that group and a guy, his name was  Jay Shanker, he   s a lawyer now. Jay was the vice president elected back  then. And I got to go to Girl   s State and was elected Governor of Girl   s  State. And I guess the other big mentor, Hannah was huge,    cause think  about what an impression you have on a young girl. How old are you in  the sixth grade? Eleven, twelve years old. I mean, phew, she was the  cat   s meow  Hannah, as a matter of fact, encouraged me to run for  delegate to the democratic convention. She said,    Vicki, you may have a  chance really of being a delegate at age eighteen.    At that time I was  away. I was a student at Vassar, but I would always come home to  9  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Oklahoma City for the summer.  And my parents were always active just at the precinct level, at their  precinct. They always participated and tried to get their neighbors  involved. So, I   m sure that   s where I got it from. What else would have  piqued that interest than seeing them do that? Not in a large way, they  would do their block. They would always be block captains for  whatever, United Way, Democratic Party, whatever. They would always  be there for their block.  I went to the democratic convention and that was quite a year. George  McGovern was the democratic nominee and Mr. Eagleton was the Vice  Presidential nominee. And that all fell by the wayside. Senator  McGovern had created these guidelines to increase participation of  women, of young people, of minorities   at the convention. And so why  did Hannah direct my eyes to that? So I did my homework and at that  time I lived in Northeast Oklahoma City. By that time my parents had  moved to Wildwood which is over by Sleepy Hollow Restaurant, the old  Sleepy Hollow Restaurant off of Fiftieth and Lincoln.  I remember being at the convention. I think John Jarman was our  Congressman for the Fifth District. And I remember getting down to the  convention and this was the state convention. I was saying I was going  to run for delegate and Mrs. Atkins was supporting me. (Laughs) So the  first slot was an open slot. You had people whispering in the background  that this slot was usually reserved. Well I didn   t have any sense of that at  eighteen. I just knew that there were these McGovern/Frasier guidelines  and they wanted women and they wanted young people and they wanted  minorities. And I was an eighteen year old, young black woman who  was at Vassar College at the time who was indigenous to Oklahoma and  I said I want one of those slots. And I remember when I told the people  in my precinct I was going to run for that spot. They said,    Oh  Well  why don   t you wait?    I said,    No  Because I run on that slot and then if I  don   t win I can win on the woman   s slot and then if I don   t win I   ll run  on the minority slot and I   ll just keep running until I win     And that   s  what I did but I didn   t have to because I won on the first slot. So I was a  delegate. I was the only eighteen year old delegate to the democratic  convention. And at the time   no I wasn   t. What   s the lady   s name     she   s a famous Oklahoma lady. Her husband was a banker. You   d know  if I said her name. She was also an eighteen year old delegate elected.  Cleta Deatherage.  Okay.  Was it Cleta? That   s not right. I   ll have to go look at that picture from  The Oklahoman. I   m trying to tell you how I met Mr. Carl Albert. And I  10  used to always volunteer down at the headquarters too, you know, big  work   licking envelopes, putting stamps on  But it was good. And I  remember David Hall was the Governor. I have some interesting off-camera  stories for that  (Laughs) I won   t make it a part of this interview.  There was a man who was a reporter for The Daily Oklahoman, a  veteran reporter. His name was Jim Young. He   s deceased now, great  guy. And I remember before we went to the convention, before we went  to Miami   and of course Hannah was a delegate   he wanted to do a  story on the youngest delegate to the democratic convention and the  youngest delegate to the republican convention. And so he interviewed  us for the story. Well this story was my life story. He had three big ol     mug shots. That was 1972. I was on the East Coast going to school. I  had a short afro and just really thought I was pretty cool. You know, I  was Ms. Activist.  Anyway, I never met Mr. Albert. When he was not on that stage, the  little giant from above Tulsa, would always come back and sit with our  delegation. He would just sit wherever. It was all noisy and chaotic at  the convention and this was the next to the last night and Mr. Albert saw  Jim Young, everybody knew Jim Young, hand me this article. It was the  article he had interviewed me for before we went, and he said,    Young  lady, I don   t think I   ve met you. Now what   s your name?    And I said,     Oh, my name   s Vicki Miles.    And he said,    You   re an Oklahoma  delegate?    I said,    Yes, sir.    He said,    Where are you from?    I said,     Oklahoma City, but I don   t live there, I go to school.    And he said,     You   re in college?    And I said,    Yes sir. I am at Vassar College.    And  he said,    Wow, that   s pretty impressive. What was that Jim Young just  gave you?    Well, there were these pictures on this article. It was a full  page article   my only full page article in the newspaper, in life   that  was flattering  (Laughs) It has these pictures about this big.  Miles-  LaGrange motions  Three different pictures of me. So it   s just these big  mug shots. He knew the article had to be about me (Laughs) so I handed  him the article and there was my whole life story on that page.  Actually, he invited me to breakfast the next morning. Mr. Albert   I  delivered one of his eulogies. I was one of the four people that gave one  of the eulogies at his funeral. Like Hannah Atkins, for me, Vicki Miles, I  owe such a great debt of gratitude to both of them for letting me be a  shadow at times, to just see and touch and feel what they did. I was still  a kid and Mr. Albert said,    If you go to law school, you want to go to  law school in Washington.    And I said,    I do want to go to law school in  Washington. I want to go to Howard University because that   s where  Justice Thurgood Marshall went to law school.    He said,    You might  look at Georgetown, too.    I said,    I want to go to Howard University  where Justice Marshall went     He said,    That   s fine. If you come to  Washington, look me up, maybe you can come work for me. I have a lot  11  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  of young people working for me.     My whole life and whole wish list of what I wanted to be when I grew  up was on that list in that article. And when I got to D.C. as a freshman  at Howard, it took me about three months to get there because I didn   t  know I could just go up there and say,    Hi, I   m Vicki, I   m here to see  the Speaker.    But I was in the wrong place. I should have started in his  Oklahoma office because in the Oklahoma office, it   s Oklahoma  constituents that take precedent. But in the Speaker   s office, it was a  little bit trickier actually getting to the Speaker, as you can imagine,  even back then. Once I said,    If I can see him I know he   ll remember  what he told me.    My mother encouraged me, she said,    Just drop him a  line, tell him what a pleasure it was to meet him and that you will follow  up next year when you get to Washington.    And I worked   I think it  was a minimum of twelve hours you could work, I worked about twelve  to fifteen hours a week, but it was wonderful   What a good experience.  For someone who loved civics and social studies and government. And  it was an exciting time. It was a very, very exciting time in the United  States.  We are getting around to how you came to run.  For the Senate?  Mm-hmm.  Again, that passion was just there. From the time I was very young, in  Edwards Addition. I loved Edwards Addition. I knew everybody there   In fact I want to be buried in the cemetery. I know everybody in the  cemetery, all my old neighbors. The lady that helped teach me to read at  four and a half. She was two doors down and in fact, she was a retired  teacher then. Her name was Irene McClellan. And I used to have to go  down to have my reading lessons because I was pretty hyper as a kid     imagine that  (Laughs) My mother had me in so many lessons  I used to  take speech and elocution lessons at the Mummer   s Theater, the old  Mummer   s Theater. It is Stage Center now, but it used to be down on  Main Street. I was in a couple of plays.  One time the NAACP Youth Center was bombed so they did a city-wide  fundraiser to rebuild the building over here. The Mummer   s did a  production of this play, it was a documentary called In White America,  and I was in that. As a kid, I was in a couple of adult plays. There  weren   t many good roles   you know what I mean, for African  12  Americans. And I was this little pickininny kid. I stole the show, every  night  Harry Golden   s Only In America, I was this little kid named Ruth  Ella, a little pickininny kid named Ruth Ella. It was a deal with a penny  in her mouth and I stole the show every night, every night. Every night I  got a standing ovation because I   m a ham   My mother put me in all these things to keep me busy. I had ballet  lessons, I had cello lessons. I studied cello at OCU from this man named  Frederick Warner who was first chair at what was then called Oklahoma  City Symphony. And I studied with Mr. Warner from the time I was  seven to the time I graduated from McGuiness. And when I got to be a  varsity cheerleader at McGuiness I didn   t want to play the cello anymore  and my momma said you will play the cello and my daddy   he usually  just said,    Mm-hmm.    And he said,    MM-HMM     Mr. Warner used to  come to our house at seven o   clock on Thursday mornings to give me  cello lessons. That was the only way I could be a cheerleader. She said,     You   re going to give that recital before you graduate, Vicki.     We lived on Seventeenth Street in the twenty-eight hundred block and  Senator E. Melvin Porter lived on Eighteenth Street in the twenty-seven  hundred block. And he was an icon. He was articulate, he was a lawyer,  he was a very effective lawyer, and he was a very effective senator. He  was there for twenty-two years. That   s a long time. I studied his record  when I was running against him. I didn   t run against him, I was running  for his seat that he currently occupied at the time. And he probably was  one of my first lawyer models. And then when we moved into  Wildwood, he and his family moved in right across the street from us on  Fifty-First Street, which is where my parents are still today. And he was  such a great storyteller. He was very charismatic, he was very smart. Did  you know Melvin Porter was the first African-American to graduate  from Vanderbilt Law School in the sixties? I don   t know how much you  know about his personage as a senator. Well, anyway   if you know it,  you know it. But, he was almost like Uncle Remus. He used to always  have an audience around. He was a great storyteller. I paged for him in  junior high school and I paged again for him in high school so I got to be  on the floor of the Oklahoma State Senate and I thought,    This is so  cool      And I would come home, you only get to page for five days a school  year, and I would tell my mom and dad about all the bills that they were  passing and how I wanted to do that. And I used to tell Senator Porter,     Senator Porter, when you don   t want your seat anymore, I   d love it.     And he would say,    Okay, Little Vicki.    When I was in law school I  used to write back to him because he was our neighbor and because we  were friends. Our families were friends and I would tell him all about  what was going on in law school. I found some of those letters because I  13  keep everything  I found some of my kindergarten report cards from my  momma. The only bad thing she said was,    She is a great student, she  just talks too much     (Laughs) So Senator Porter was just   we just  loved him. Kids loved him, young people loved him. He loved to talk.  He was such a great talker and he had good stories to tell. So I had this  kind of expressed interest as early as probably junior high school,     Senator Porter, I would love to do what you do.     Well, I had graduated from Howard Law School. My first job out of law  school, I clerked for a federal judge in Houston, a man named Woodrow  Seals. Judge Seals had been a Kennedy appointee to the branch. He was  from a place called Bogalusa, Mississippi. I clerked for Judge Seals for  two years. After that I went back to Washington, D.C. They have a  program at the Department of Justice for young lawyers called the  Honor Law Graduate Program and you can rotate either through the  criminal division of the Department of Justice or the Civil Division. So I  rotated through the criminal division. I got to prosecute Nazi war  criminals residing in the U.S. They were almost all dead, but there were  still a few of them around   this was the late 1970s and early 1980s. I  worked a little bit on the Demjanjuk case, he was at Treblinka. They  were paper cases. But anyway, I was there at  the Department of  Justice  and then I left D.C. in 1983 because I was ready to come back home.  Well, I tried to get on at the U.S. Attorney   s Office and I did not get on.  That   s totally discretionary hiring on the part of the U.S. Attorney, not  knowing that I would one day be the U.S. Attorney. And I was feeling  pretty rejected when that didn   t work out for me    cause I just knew, now  who else would want to come to Oklahoma except somebody from  Oklahoma? Now how many people could want to come? Because it was  a lateral transfer and that local attorney   s office did not have to use an  FTE  full-time employee  to hire somebody from the department. I just  knew I had that job  And when I didn   t, I was pretty despondent. This  was 1983.  So I walked across the street to the District Attorney   s office and the  District Attorney was this big fellow with a cowboy hat and a string tie  named Bob Macy. I did not have an interview. I just approached with  my resume in hand, rejected. Eventually I got in to see him that day. I  just persisted with the lady, a lovely lady. We became friends later. Her  name was Joanne Bronstad. She probably still lives in Edmond. She was  his assistant and she kept saying,    Well, I don   t know, you don   t have an  interview.    I just kept thinking if I stand here long enough he has got to  come out that door   it   s almost lunchtime. (Laughs) So we talked and  chatted and I asked her if I could leave my papers and she asked,    Well  how long are you here?    And I was leaving that next day because I had  just come home for that interview and I was going to leave the next day.  14  I think it was probably a Monday and I was leaving that Tuesday to go  back, because I had to go back to work in D.C. And what happened, he  came out that door  (Laughs) And she introduced me and said this is  Vicki Miles and she   s a native Oklahoman and she   s a young prosecutor  at the Department of Justice and she   s wanting to come back to  Oklahoma City. And he said,    Well, you got a minute? I   m on my way  to lunch, you got a minute?    I said,    Sure     (Laughs) I cannot believe  that I came out of there with a job offer. And I knew I was ready to  come home, that was my goal. It made sense to try to go to the U.S.  Attorney   s office.  Little did I know how difficult and competitive those jobs are because  they don   t turn over that often. So I went back to D.C., and came back  home a couple of months later. That was 1983 and everybody starts in  misdemeanors. I was a Misdemeanor Assistant District Attorney and  then that office got a big grant from Oklahoma Highway Safety Office,  so I ran the DUI Divisions Office. I finally got out of misdemeanors.  And then I was in sex crimes with a wonderful prosecutor named Barry  Albert. It was then that I really started, once I was back home and  settled, that I really started thinking about what I had told Senator Porter  all of those years ago. One day Senator Porter goes on television, he was  very colorful, and he announced that he wasn   t going to seek his senate  seat anymore. I thought    He didn   t tell me.    Like he had to tell me, like  it was his seat to give me   it belonged to the people. My dad used to  always remind me,    That   s not anybody   s seat, that   s the people   s seat.  And the people decide, Vicki, who   s going to fill that.    By then I was  committed to run. I talked to him and he said,    I   m giving this up.  Twenty-two years is long enough.     I eventually went in and talked to Mr. Macy and said,    Mr. Macy,     against my mother   s counsel, my mother said    Vicki, you just got there.  Don   t go tell the man    I want to go do this and if I don   t make it, can I  come back.       (Laughs) That   s exactly what I asked him. He said,    Of  course you can. I have a feeling, partner, if you do it you   re not going to  be coming back.    I said,    Well, you know more than I know.    And so I  ran in 1986. Senator Porter ran in 1986. I had to quit my job as a sex  crimes prosecutor.  My campaign headquarters was down at the corner of Twenty-Third and  Kelley. You know where the Governor   s Mansion is, and then there   s  the Interstate Oil Compact   s building. And then there was this old  rickety abandoned gas station. It was an old time car wash that was long  and so, we found out who owned that property and we rented it for that  summer. We got in there and painted and cleaned those windows up     put Vicki Miles-LaGrange all on the windows.  15  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  My dad being an industrial arts teacher, he was retired by then, was  loving it because he was into his old groove, you know. And my mother  and her best friend, a lady named Cam Byrd, they were my campaign  managers. And my mom was this retired kindergarten teacher, actually  she retired from the State Department of Education but she   s still like a  kindergarten teacher, even at eighty-seven, she   s this kindergarten  teacher. Everybody has their assignment and you have to sit there until  yours is done. (Laughs) That   s the way she treated people who came into  the headquarters  We   d say    Momma, these people are volunteers.     She   d say,    How long do you have?    And when they would tell her  she   d say,    Now, for the next hour, this is what we need you to do.    She  was great. She and her friend, they were great.  I had no money. I had no organization. And I really didn   t have that  much name recognition. If you grew up in segregated Oklahoma City,  when the schools were segregated, my dad had taught everybody that  had gone through Douglass High School and if you were black, you  went to Douglass. And then during the integration, my dad retired as  assistant principal. He is kind of the disciplinarian sort. He had been at  just about every school in the city, Northwest Classen, Capitol Hill, U.S.  Grant. So people knew our family name that way. But they didn   t know  me from Adam, you know. It was amazing, the whole thing was  amazing.  I followed this little book. I followed a lot of advice from Hannah  Atkins. One of my first political teachers, Mr. Albert, I let him remain  anonymous in all of this. But, I had seen enough. You know, the  opportunity to observe people who did very well what I was trying to do  by running for office and that was to serve in a legislative body and  represent the constituents. It was amazing. Can I tell you one story about  the race?  Sure.  There was a book. I   m Ms. How-To. At any given time, I   m probably  taking some class at some library or some Vo-tech on how to do  something. And so, this book was recommended to me, I don   t even  know who originally told me about it. There was a group in the sixties,  the late sixties, called the Women   s Education Fund. They were out of  Washington, D.C. and their objective was to get women elected to  public office. And they had this book, and I   m looking at this book, and  it   s so funny now, but it   s so basic. It   s called the Campaign Workbook.  It has from A to Z how to run and how to win office as a woman. And it  starts with very simplistic things like, you know, putting your life out  there on a piece of paper and seeing where your little soft spots are. And  how are you going to respond to certain things, and who is your support  16  group going to be, and how are you going to be when everybody   s  talking about you, from the six o   clock news to the paper to whatever.  Are you strong enough to deal with this or are you going to fall apart,  are people around you going to fall apart, how do you raise money, how  do you get out the vote? I mean, it was an A to Z, it was like a primer on  how to, if you   re a woman, run for office.  There was a chapter on incumbents and running against an incumbent,  which I was running against a twenty-two year incumbent. Well, I read  that book from beginning to end. And one of the chapters in this book  was about targeting and how before you even sign up to do this deal, you  need to do your targeting research. What your targeting research is going  to do, you do is   it didn   t work so well for a senate race because it was  every four years, so that   s a longer period of time. It works real well for  a house race, which are two year terms. So let   s say you look at those  election returns for that candidate that you   re running against for two  races. Eight years is almost too much because the demographics can  change so much in an area over an eight year period. So I did Senator  Porter   s. Actually I just did the term   his last voting just four years  before 1986, so that would have been 1982. It was hard then because  stuff wasn   t computerized and I had to go to the county election board  and they would let you buy Xeroxes of the precinct books. They were  available for public viewing but you had to stand there and Xerox them.  I had to do that for thirty-two precincts, so that was a lot of Xeroxing.  Now they can probably just send it to you by email or whatever, for a  cost. It was a cost then.  So for targeting research they gave you this formula and by the time you  did your targeting research you had a snapshot of every precinct of who  supported him, who supported the other people, who didn   t vote. You  had everything you needed. And the targeting research, once it was done  for the total number of precincts, you were supposed to look at where his  strengths were and you were supposed to identify as many strengths that  you had in your opponents strong areas. And you were going to play to  those strengths in those areas. You didn   t have enough time, money,  people resources to spend in every precinct so this targeting research  tells you how to spend your limited resources. So what I found as a  result of my targeting research, there were thirty-two precincts and for  nearly twenty-two years, Senator Porter had won from only eleven of  thirty-two precincts. That is what my targeting research following this  book told me.  So then I zoomed in on those eleven precincts. Well what was his  number one vote-getting precinct? Garden Oaks. That   s where I had  gone to elementary school, that   s where my mother had taught  kindergarten for forty-some-odd years. Bing. The lights went off. You  17  don   t have the same money, people, time as your incumbent opponent  does, so use resources, unconventional resources. I said,    Momma, if  before this race is over you will knock on every door in Garden Oaks           cause what person doesn   t love their kids    kindergarten teacher?  Everybody loves the kindergarten teacher. It took her the whole four  months. I said,    Momma, you have got to stop going in these people   s  houses, don   t get off the porch. Oh, Mrs. Miles, come in     They wanted  to tell the story of where all the kids were.    Oh, you know, little Bobby  didn   t make it, he   s in prison, but Judy did good     She had to hear  everybody   s story. But it paid off. The second vote-getting precinct is  the area that is now the Health Sciences Center. At that time, those were  thriving communities before urban renewal came and dislocated   un-located  all those families. Some of us who have sentimental memories of  all that feel differently about all that.  His second top-vote getting precinct was that JFK area where John F.  Kennedy Junior High School was over on Martin Luther King. It is there  now. The building is there, falling apart. But it   s now Moon, and the old  Moon is something for the medical complex. Well, my dad was the  assistant principal in Moon Junior High School and he had taught there  for years. He had taught at Douglass for hundreds of years  (Laughs)  Then he moved to Moon. So I knew that my dad   people who were  voters in that area, people had a sense of who my dad was because he  loved his kids and he taught usually all boys in industrial arts. I didn   t  get him to knock on doors. He   s not the knocking on door type. And so I  knew, what the Campaign Workbook told me was you just play to your  strengths in those areas because as much as you can break up your  opponents strong haul the better. And what you do with the lion   s share  of your people, of your money, and of your time, is up to you. For me, it  was twenty-two other precincts. That   s where I directed my money and  resources. Whoever put a yard sign up for me, I took it. But I really  concentrated on those areas. And it worked, it worked.  Election night, everybody   s up at headquarters waiting for those returns,  and they said,    God, Vicki, you seem so calm  Aren   t you nervous?     And I said,    No, not yet. I   m just waiting for some precincts to come  in.    And they said,    What are you waiting for?    I said,    Well, I   m  waiting for Garden Oaks to come in.    Because I knew if I could impact  his number one vote-getting precinct for twenty-two years, I had a  feeling that I had a pretty good chance of winning. And so, sure enough,  when Garden Oaks came in, his margin was like less than thirty percent  that he beat me in that precinct, and I was ecstatic  And so as they came  in   they came in as probably I thought they were going to come in from  that, because it was downhill from there.  But that story with my mom is so funny. She was so funny. She and her  18  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  friend Camolia Byrd. And Cam Byrd had retired from Oklahoma City  Board of Education and she was the ESL, English as a second language  coordinator of that board, and they were so funny  They were out there  just organizing their butts off  (Laughs) And it all was for my benefit.  Everybody said    How did you do it?    I said,    Ask Momma and Ma  Byrd.    I said,    Momma and Ma Byrd, they did it, I was just the  beneficiary.    Another thing I did   it was a very grassroots campaign,  and that   s what all that kind of literature says. If the area in which you   re  running is small enough, to do that door-to-door. Campaigns are not won  in offices. They are not won sending out literature. They are won  pressing the flesh and looking people in the eye and answering  questions, even though they might be humiliating. And I got a lot of that.  I mean, he was very revered and respected by many. There was no grey  with this guy, you either loved him or you hated him. He was a big civil  rights activist and very gregarious and very forward on all of that and  sometimes offensive to some. I thought he was funny. I never was  offended by him or afraid of him, and I think that helped, too. But I  worked every day during the daytime. My mom and Ma Byrd were at  the campaign headquarters. I would go there and they would put me to a  task. I would say,    I   m the candidate, do I have to look up phone  numbers?    We didn   t have money to buy lists or any of that. She had us  doing all that stuff manually   Did you have to do it the second time around?  Nope, never had another opponent. It was just one time because 1986-  1990 and then in    90, I didn   t have an opponent and then in    93 I got the  appointment from President Clinton recommended by Senator Boren.  And Senator Boren, I never worked for him, but he   s been another  mentor   I knew him from party politics. I was the Democratic National  Committee  DNC  woman from Oklahoma for probably two terms     well, almost the whole time I was in Senate. Lou Watkins, Wes  Watkins    wife, Hannah was on the DNC. And when Hannah gave up her  seat   and timing wise I don   t know the years. Lou Watkins ran and  there was always a male and female on the DNC from every state, so  there was just one. All this is so kind of fading in my brain   We had better check on your time.  What time is it? I gotta go   We   ll have to do round two another time. Thank you for your time today  and we   ll do it again.  --- End of November 5, 2007 Interview ---  19  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  --- Start of December 17, 2007 Interview ---  Today is December 17, 2007 and this is part two of an interview with  Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange who was a Senator from    86 to    93 here in  Oklahoma and this is part of the OSU Library project called Women of  the Oklahoma Legislature. And my name is Tanya Finchum and last  time Judge Miles-LaGrange told us a little bit about her childhood and  about her early political aspirations and we got up to election. Today we  will start with what she recalls from that night moving forward.  I guess the main thing that I recall about election night is that I was the  victor, and so I liked that a lot. We worked very hard with hardly any  money and very limited organization in terms of the number of  volunteers. My mother was my campaign manager, a former  kindergarten teacher, and her best friend. They were my main volunteers  and we took who we could get. I ran a very grassroots campaign and it  paid off that night.  And for your swearing in ceremony, who all came with you?  Oh, it was all of my family and my then-husband, Jacques LaGrange,  and my niece who was about five or six, Brittany Scott, my mom and  my dad, Charles and Mary Miles, my sister, Gail Miles-Scott, and my  first secretary who is now deceased, Sheila Wiley-Cooper. Jacques     family was there. My Vassar roommate, Marguerite Barkley, and there  were a host of friends and family that were there. Many of my aunts and  uncles who were living in Georgia, Margaret Reed   everybody is  deceased now, it   s kind of sad. They were all there. It was great.  A good crew.  Yes, it was great.  Tell us a little bit about the first time you presented a bill on the floor.  Yes, I was very nervous. And I think the very first bill that I ever  presented was a senate-joint resolution which was a lot easier than a bill.  And the essence of it, as I recall, was to create a literacy task force. I had  been a volunteer through my sorority, through Junior League   I may  have been a provisional at the time, right after election, and I worked at  a literacy center. I volunteered at a literacy center up on Classen and I  was just appalled with the pervasiveness of adult illiteracy in our state.  And so that was my very first effort out there on my maiden voyage. I  did some homework with the people at the State Department of  Education at that time. I worked with the senate staff. They are an  extraordinary bunch, the staffers, the professional staffers then, and I   m  20  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  sure now, on both sides of the aisle. Those men and women are very  gifted researchers and policy writers in their respective substantive  areas. So I went with that and it was successful and I was happy and it  took a lot of deep breaths to get it passed.  I did quite a bit of work over the next couple of years. With hindsight,  you look at how much effort was put in. I don   t know how much, let   s  say, the general populace at large is aware of the kind of work that goes  into any measure in that process of a bill becoming a law. But it   s so  much work and so much effort and so much dynamic. As I grew as a  senator, I certainly grew in my skillfulness of getting measures passed.  And some people are not too complimentary of that process but the  average senator, the average representative   and this may sound self-serving     but I believe they work very hard and they believe in what  they are doing, even if it   s something I don   t agree with. They work very  hard at what they are doing and they do so honorably to get their  measures enacted into law.  Were there other goals that you had in mind as you came in that you  wanted to accomplish?  I did. I had as a lawyer in my career   at that point as a lawyer, as a  prosecutor, I had a lot of concerns. I had been a sex crimes prosecutor in  the Oklahoma County District Attorney   s Office before coming to the  Senate and I had also been a trial attorney for the Department of Justice  in Washington. I was concerned about a lot of issues that affected  women, families and children. And if you kind of look through the  annals of my legislative initiatives, I think you will see a lot of matters.  I can think of one that   I think it was actually a House bill, but I carried  it in the Senate. It was to deal with pre-natal care in the state of  Oklahoma through the Oklahoma State Health Department. The bottom  line was you get out of Oklahoma County and Tulsa County and into  some of the very, very rural counties of our state, there was just a dearth  of counties that had absolutely zero pre-natal care available for pregnant  women. And if you don   t have good care you   re not going to have good  outcomes, a lot of times with those babies. And I found myself doing  everything from literacy to   oh I had a mammogram bill that was quite  colorful that Governor Bellmon finally signed. And, it wasn   t him. I had  attacks from little,    ol na  ve   me, I was just thinking about old Ben  Franklin that,    An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.    Well  that depends on what the proposed cure is. (Laughs) And not  appreciating fully the extent to which the whole other side of the  argument of any kind of mandated coverage from the standpoint of  insurance companies. Obviously that   s not something that they   insurance companies  favor because it   s a real cost issue for them.  21  So I got baptized and I remember my bill dying. It died in committee. I  had all the business interests. It was very interesting. Small business  people obviously don   t like mandated coverage because it costs the  small business person more. So you find yourself giving and taking in  that process. Your bill may not look like it started out looking. You try  to figure out what you   re willing to compromise to get your measure  through. There were things that I abandoned and then there were things  that I compromised. I think that   s just part of the learning process out  there of how things got done. Because by the time I left I started to get  really fairly adept at getting my measures passed. And a lot of times,  lending support to your colleagues on their particular efforts. A lot of  horse trading went on   a lot of horse trading, as you can imagine. And  that   s not a negative it   s just kind of a way of doing business.  I   ve found myself having to convince people whose interests were very  different than mine. Somebody has said, I don   t know to whom this  quote is attributed,    In politics there are no permanent friends, there are  no permanent enemies, there are just permanent interests.    And that kind  of speaks volumes, just about the process. Because I can remember my  mammogram bill, when it was killed in committee, it did not have a  requisite number of votes to be recorded out. I remember it going to  senate staff because I remember having seen measures that died in  committee and the next thing I knew, they were reappearing on the floor.  Well they had been attached procedurally to another bill that had some  germaneness. And I found out that to continue on with my mammogram  bill, which I really believed in   all of the figures, many of which were  from the American Cancer Society, showed just the savings to  everybody involved, that prevention, that early detection, that   s one of  the kinds of cancers that early detection could often times make a  difference for that person involved. I was learning all along the process.  I remember asking the senate staff was there any way that I could  possibly revive my measure. And there was a senate author who had  absolutely no interest in a mammogram bill until I sat and talked to him  and I thought,    Well he has a mother and he has a wife and he even has  daughters.    And that was the vantage point that I went and talked to my  colleague. We basically we are always on polar opposite sides of the  fence and when I spoke to him and shared why I thought that it was so  important and why it made the dollars and cents for Oklahoma insurance  companies. By the time the bill actually was signed by Governor  Bellmon it was not my original bill. It was my bill that had been tacked  on to a funeral home bill. (Laughs) But it was passed and he voted for it  and he told me that if he saw that my measure, which he knew had been  voted unfavorably on in committee was pulling his bill down, that he  was going to detach my amendment which was the bill that I had lost in  committee.  22  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  And I think at that time I got a critical editorial from one of the daily  presses that was entitled,    Another way to legislate.    And it was talking  about that process of doing that was so unfair. It wasn   t like my  colleagues on either side of the aisle did not know upon which they were  voting. It was just that it was the only way I could get it to the floor and I  was determined to get it to the floor because I knew that because we all  have mothers and wives and sisters, that there was a broader interest  there. And there was a more common interest that went beyond the  interest of an insurance company or small business person. There was  something that was common and that was data about what an early  mammogram could do in the fight against breast cancer. And so I found  myself chuckling that I was criticized for doing what I saw as a normal  practice because an author, whether it   s something I agree with or not,  that   s insignificant. But if you want your bill passed, then you will go  through for it in any legitimate or conceivable fashion that you can get it  done. Thank goodness Governor Bellmon felt the same way because  ultimately, as you know, the Governor signs, enacts the bill into law  once it passes both houses, and there were a lot of compromises along  the way but we were able to get that bill passed.  And I had been asked to carry that bill. That was not a senate bill, it was  a house bill. The late Representative Freddie Williams found herself a  victim of breast cancer and asked if I would carry the bill in the Senate.  And I just very affectionately said,    Oh yes.    And naively said,    Yes.     Who knew that breast cancer was not going to be supported by  everyone. And you come with, or at least I came with   I was a lawyer  and I had been a lawyer for some years, but little did I know. Every day  was a growth process for me, and one that I will cherish forever.  Sounds like you learned how to negotiate.  I did.  Better and better each     Every, every, every time with every bill and with people. One thing I  learned, though   your word had to be your bond. That was all you had  with your colleagues was your word. And so don   t over commit, don   t  commit too early, make sure you understand to what you   re committing  because   if you ever found yourself in a situation where you did not  keep your word, I have seen my colleagues on both sides of the aisle,  both parties, being kind of   listed. And that   s not a good thing. And  that   s probably just a life lesson. Let your word be your bond, know to  what you   re committing before you do it.  Do you have to do a lot of reading and studying?  23  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  A lot of reading, a lot of study and know what you   re voting for. I mean,  I was actually a bill reader and people used to tease me about that.  (Laughs) Well how can you vote on this thing if you don   t know what  you   re voting on? I don   t know if that is because I was a lawyer or  because I was me, but I tried to read all the bills. They   d say,    You   re  going to die  You can never read all this stuff.    And I said,    Well at least  read all the headings and know generally what   s there.    Because just as I  put my mammogram bill in a funeral home bill and so it was attached as  an amendment, for someone who was passionately or adamantly  opposed to that for whatever reason, I mean they had a right to know  that. And it   s so fast and furious, the only way you can know that is to  try to do a lot of reading for yourself.  Does not everyone read?  I don   t know, but I know I tried. (Laughs) I   m not going to comment on  others. I know many people who really try hard and it   s a lot to keep up  with. A lot to keep up with.  Then when you   re the chair of a committee you have even more.  You have even more. It was interesting. 1986 was a very interesting year  in the Oklahoma Senate. There had been a very vigorous campaign with  our major press here in Oklahoma City and it was called,    Throw the  Rascals Out.    That was the theme that ran through many of the   and  maybe that wasn   t a theme, maybe I was paying more attention because  I was in that race running for the same seat as a 22-year incumbent. And  maybe my antennas were more perched to everything around me that  pertained to it. A number of the majority of the very long term  incumbent senators were ousted that year. They were not re-elected,  both democrat and republican. There aren   t but 48 senators and there  was a whole class of senators particularly in Oklahoma County that were  not re-elected   very, very tenured senators from both sides of the aisle.  And I recall that those of us who were the victors, the winners of those  seats, we found ourselves very   a lot of times, it would take at least a  decade in a normal environment. And term limits, I think   and initially  when I came there were not term limits but term limits were adopted by  the voters at the beginning of my second term. And there was some  grandfathering in for people sitting at the time. But it did begin to affect  some of those people. But many of my classmates in the freshman senate  class of 1986, we found ourselves getting chairs and co-chairs of very  important senate committees because there were so many incumbents,  long term incumbents, who held those seats who had been defeated. I  think initially, I got a vice-chairmanship of the Senate Government  Operations Committee. And then it may have been the next year or at  24  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  the beginning of my third year that I was named chairman of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, which was just unheard of for   I mean, I was still  considered a rookie senator. And was I ever a rookie. But all of the  legislation that affected the courts of Oklahoma, the employees of the  courts, the judges   all of that legislation came through the Senate  Judiciary Committee. So I had to grow up very quickly in the Senate.  And not just me, I think many of my classmates, for similar reasons,  were kind of thrust into places that    for some, it was their first year,  their first, second or third year being thrust into those kinds of positions  of extraordinary responsibility. There were certainly senate staffers who  were assigned to the Senate Judiciary Committee but then there were all  of the various competing interests who might be on one side or on the  other of various legislation   worker   s compensation which is a very, a  very highly debated issue. And that list is very long with just the topics  that would come through a judiciary committee.  My very first year, I was asked by the then-Pro Tempore of the Senate,  Senator Cullison from Skiatook. Well, actually, Roger Randal from  Tulsa was Pro-Tempore of the Senate and he was finishing up his term  and then Senator Cullison succeeded him as Pro-Tempore of the Senate.  And wow, I was named to the Education Appropriations Committee my  very first year. That   s unheard of  And a number of my colleagues were  named to the Appropriations Committee as well as the various  substantive areas, education and transportation committees. It was large.  And so a lot of us were forced to kind of grow up very quickly in the  Senate.  Your leadership skills had already surfaced a little bit.  They were kind of forced to. And they got refined or they got (Laughs)  squished really quickly.  You had been voted Governor for Girls    State. That was a leadership  role I   m sure.  It was, but Girls    State was a lot different than the Oklahoma Senate.  But that was the beginning.  But it was a good beginning, a beginning that taught me respect and  reverence for the process. And that was an advantage as far as I was  concerned. And that   s why I was so upset with that editorial which  somehow suggested that I had done something inconsistent with the  process in order to get my mammogram bill passed. (Laughs) Maybe it  was not the conventional way of how a bill becomes a law on the    chart  25  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  of instruction 101,    but it certainly was a way to get your measure  passed. But you learn to have thick skin. My skin got really thick during  those years. You couldn   t take any of that personally and as long as you  did your work with integrity, which I think that the majority of the men  and women serve at great peril in the state legislative body.  At the time when you came in    86, how many other women were with  you?  In the Senate at that time, there were less than five. Senator Maxine  Horner of Tulsa was elected in my class, Senator Billie Floyd is a lovely  person and very zealous in her causes, from Ada. And then there was,  from the other side of the aisle there was Senator Helen Cole of Norman.  I think it was around   out in the Moore-Norman area because her son  was also in the Senate, Tom Cole and I think he was from the Yukon  area. Gosh it   s amazing, I should have looked at my chart. Senator  Bernice Shedrick and she was one of the more senior women senators  and very, very effective. She was from Stillwater. I know I   m missing  somebody. She was in the House when I first came into the Senate and  she later moved to the Senate. Senator Penny Williams of Tulsa   a very  effective senator. Oh, Trish Weedn   Senator Trish Weedn from Purcell.  And I think Senator Trish, Senator Maxine, myself and I   m trying to  remember if Senator Billie Floyd was there when I came or did we come  in the same class? She may have been there when I came. It all kind of  runs together. But that was it out of a body of 48.  Did you notice any gender differences then     I think it was very individualized but you just had to educate your male  colleagues real quickly. I can remember my very first day that one of  my   and I don   t wear my    female-ness    on my shoulder. I don   t wear  my    African American-ness    on my shoulders but if somebody gets out  of line, then I don   t have a problem letting them know that that   s off  limits. One of my male colleagues made the most off-color remark  related to my legs, the very first day. And I just kind of let loose and I  told him that you know, well it wasn   t that nice. And I mean, I just  couldn   t believe he had said that in 1986. I mean, I got there, we both     he was in my class, too. We both got there the same way and we never  had a problem after that. And that doesn   t mean that I can   t accept a  compliment. I   m a female, I love a compliment. What female doesn   t  like a compliment? But that compliment was not well received because I  don   t think it was well-intended. And I never had that problem with him  again. I can think about the mammogram bill. Oh, gosh  Just some of the  things that some of my colleagues said about the subject of the bill, I  can   t even say it on the film.  26  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  I can imagine.  It was just   it was like the Neanderthal as far as I was concerned. I just  could not believe that. And so, I thought as I was kind of negotiating  through I said,    Vicki, don   t get hung up. Just don   t take it personally.     Inappropriate characterizations of the bill   if they were going to give  me a green light, because you were always running your votes to see if  you have enough to pass. You just kind of sucked it up. I kind of went  back and tried to do minor education. I don   t think I changed anybody   s  mind. (Laughs) Because they still persisted in referring to that bill in  very derogatory ways.  Same thing about some of the minority-specific legislation that I  sponsored. I had a bill called The Fair Employment Practices Act. It was  really a bill to address   and it became law with much compromise, but  if you looked at the numbers of state employees across the state, if you  looked at certain levels, whether it was the top level or the middle level  or the lower level, you saw the faces of those people. And in the top  levels throughout Oklahoma government, they were predominantly  white men. And you did not see many ethnic minorities. You did not see  many women. And I mean, I worked on this bill for about a year and  then you had the veteran preference, which is a very important  preference for the men and women who have served in our armed forces.  But that would trump that whole class of people and even though they  were equally and probably sometimes more qualified than someone with  that veteran preference just by shear resume to resume   they never even  got the interview. It was discretionary. It created really a fiction to allow,  that was my great compromise because my initial bill was mandatory  and that wasn   t going to pass.  I had some of my colleagues who in their own sincerity came to me and  said,    You know, I don   t have anybody minority in my whole district.    I  said,    Well you   ve got women.    They   d say,    Well yeah, but nobody is  going to care about this where I come from.    And those are the kind of  conversations that you would get.    Well, you   ve got to give me a reason  for supporting this.    It made me refine   some people call it horse  trading   why this was important. Why this makes good sense for  Oklahoma. Why this makes good sense for the Oklahoma State Senate.  And I had to, I always found myself regrouping, which is good. It   s  supposed to be a deliberative body and I learned how to do that very  well. If I couldn   t look my colleague in the eye and really make the case  as to why I deserve their support, I didn   t get it.  And everything was in numbers. If you wanted your measure to become  law it came down to the numbers. I don   t want to say game because it  wasn   t a game but you had to have the numbers to get your bill to  27  become law. But by the time that bill finally became law, it was very  watered down. If one woman or one ethnic minority was hired that  otherwise may not have been because of the kind of chronic nature of  why they were not hired then it was good. I think it   s still the law in  Oklahoma books because I remember having to respond to a U.S.  Senator when I was being considered for the federal bench on that  special emphasis legislation. I remember being in my basement trying to  find the file. I had to remind him that it would not have passed. It would  not have been signed into law by the Governor if it had been  unconstitutional. That   s where the senate staff professionals come into  the process.  It   s very interesting, very interesting. I can remember   I had hearings  with a representative in the House at the time named Vicki White. It  created an advisory task force on child care. At that time the whole  global nature of child care facilities were regulated by the Department of  Human Services. It just took a comprehensive look over about an 8-  month period of many, many hearings. At child care, we were looking at  things like work-site child care facilities, something that the feds had in  1995 when the Murrah Building bomb occurred. That child care center  was a work-site child care facility over in the Murrah Building. Looking  at the reimbursement breaks for child care for women on public  assistance, it took a comprehensive look at child care and people were  like,    As a senator from Oklahoma City that chairs the Senate Judiciary  Committee why would you care about child care issues?    But I was very  concerned and I   m sure it was because of the district that I represented. I  was very concerned about quality of life issues and child care is really  the issue. It   s not an issue if you can afford to pay it and can afford the  best that   s available but most Oklahoma women may not be able to  afford that. And I don   t mean women on public assistance necessarily  but they deserve a quality of child care just like the woman who can  afford to pay for the finest care or care in her home, and bring the child  care provider to their home, which is probably the highest and the best.  Well, the highest and the best would probably be a momma that can  afford to stay home and raise those babies.  But I did care about those quality of life issues because those are the  kinds of issues I believed and still believe affect the quality of little  people that grow into big people and run the country someday. So, I  really cared a lot about those kinds of   in addition to issues involving  the courts and matters of law and justice. I really care a lot about  literacy. Those are kind of fundamental issues. There are many people  who can   t read. How can you do anything   how can you even drive?  You just know the shapes and the signs and red means stop and yellow  means yield. But I loved my service in the Oklahoma Senate.  28  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  What prompted you to leave instead of run again?  Probably an offer of being considered as the Chief Federal Prosecutor  for Oklahoma City in 1994. And I remember just feeling when that  opportunity presented itself   and I had been a career prosecutor, state  and federal, by that point in my life as a lawyer, which was my chosen  profession. I can remember literally almost agonizing about leaving the  Senate. Sure the pay was much better, the responsibility was different,  the branch of government was different. Just being in the executive  branch, the law enforcement branch rather than the branch that is  probably closest to the people   the legislative branch, the law-making  branch. Very, very different kinds of hats. And I pondered and I prayed  and I talked to people who I knew would have my back either way, my  family.  David Walters was the Governor and he was going to set a special  election for my seat because it was in the middle of my term because I  had been re-elected without opposition in 1990 and this was 1993. So I  had a little more than a year left in my term. I can remember he kept  trying to get my resignation letter because he needed to do process-wise  all of the things, which was a lot according to the state election boards,  to set the election up. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. And  that letter, I mean, I think I delivered my letter on the day of my  swearing in. And I kind of wanted to wait until after and they were like,     You can   t hold two. Give us that letter     But for me, that was my life  and I was giving up something that   well obviously, I had decided by  then that was in my best interest to move on but sometimes things  present themselves to you. And it   s not part of any plan that you had for  yourself. I loved representing the state of Oklahoma as a sex crimes  prosecutor, just like I loved representing the people of the United States  as a federal prosecutor.  You were one of the first women to do that, too, weren   t you?  Yes, at the federal level I got the appointment by President Bill Clinton  in 1993 but I loved my Senate service.  While you were in the Senate you went to Dublin, Ireland     I went to Dublin. There was the International Summit of Women and it  was so eye-opening for me. I guess that was my second opportunity to  travel abroad. My first time was as a student at Vassar College and I did  summer abroad at the University of Ghana in West Africa. And so that  was in, circa summer of    74. And so the next time I went abroad I was a  state senator and I went to this International Summit of Women and  there were women from places that I had never heard of. I really did not  29  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  know where those small countries were. And the women were from all  around the globe. And it was such an eye-opener for me because  sometimes we think the issues that consume our own little patch are the  issues of today. And I was so, I think it   s the Children   s Defense Fund,  that motto that says,    The sea is so wide and my boat is so small.    That   s  how I felt at this conference and probably the one issue that was  pervasive   you know what it was? Clean water.  It   s not just a women   s issue.  It   s not just a women   s issue, it   s a human issue. And it   s something that  I take so much for granted and you know, in an industrialized,  modernized nation like the United States of America   water? Come on.  That   s not an issue for me in Oklahoma. But it was, and at the time Mary   Robinson  was the President of Ireland and we got to go to the White  House there in Ireland and meet her and she was very present at that  meeting. It was a long time ago. But it was a phenomenal experience and  I think that would be what later really   that and the Ghana experience  piqued my interest in matters of international concern.  And then you served as a delegate to the Soviet Union?  Right as   I forgot about that. At that same time, as my years in the  Senate. There is a bipartisan group called the American Council of  Young Political Leaders  ACYPL  and it   s a Washington-based group  and that group sponsors exchanges for then   back then, it was  legislative. I don   t know if they did executive branch. I think now  ACYPL is doing some judicial branch exchanges too, between the  Soviet Union and many other countries. But then the push was for the  legislative branch and also appointed officials as well as elected  officials. I remember there were five delegates in my group and there  was me, I was a democratic senator from Oklahoma and there was the  republican representative from somewhere, there was somebody from  the heritage   it   s not called the Heritage Association. It   s a fairly  conservative think tank   policy think tank out of Washington. There  was somebody from California in the group and then there was an  appointed official from Nevada or somewhere. So we all really spanned  the stretch of political thought.  Well how did you get chosen?  I don   t know, I don   t know how they got to me but it was great. It was so  instructive and I found myself in the then-Soviet Union in December of  1990, which was the time   I was in the then-Soviet Union when the  transition occurred from the Soviet Union to the Russian Federation. It  was extraordinary. I could not believe that I had an opportunity   I  30  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  mean, I just felt like I was growing up really fast. Being introduced to a  culture at such a very historic time and that certainly piqued my interest.  We got to meet Boris Yeltsin. It was just, it was phenomenal. It was  three phenomenal weeks   the coldest weeks ever. But it was very  interesting times.  Pinch yourself to see if it was real.  Yes, yes, to be in Russia. I have no idea how I got there.  None at all?  Well there was a man from Oklahoma who was involved. His name was  Danny McDonald. And I think he used to be with the Corporation  Commission. At the time he lived in Washington. He was an Oklahoman  who at that time was very involved in with the affairs of ACYPL and  they are still quite a viable group and have expanded their reach far  beyond what they were doing back in the    90s. But it was   gives me  chills to think about it.  An exciting time.  It was. It really was.  Since leaving the Senate rather, you were a judge     U.S. Attorney first.  That first and then     I was appointed to the bench in   I was U.S. Attorney for less than  twenty-four months because there was a vacancy that occurred. Judge  Lee West was ready to take senior status and his decision created a  vacancy on that bench. And I was encouraged and did put myself  forward. Senator   then United States Senator David Boren was my  sponsoring senator who sponsored my nomination for both Chief  Federal Prosecutor and for the Federal Bench. And for that, of course, I  am forever grateful. I mean I never   some people do things looking for  the next piece. At the time that the Chief Federal Prosecutor, the U.S.  Attorney presented itself as a possible opportunity, it was nothing that I  had particularly thought about. I had had a fairly   well my entire career  I   d been told that. I never practiced privately until I was a senator.  Probably if I could have still been a prosecutor, I would have still been a  prosecutor. I had great training in both the Department of Justice and I  was in non-litigating sections at the Department at a great time. Bob  Macy was the District Attorney that I worked directly under a long time.  31  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Sex crimes prosecutor, Barry Albert, was a phenomenal prosecutor     very skillful, very fair, but very unrelenting. I learned from the best,  learned from the best. He is deceased now. And on the judge score, I had  never thought about either one of those. I mean, I was perfectly satisfied  and was working very hard as a state senator and I was kind of  beginning to move up in the ranks of that body. But it just hadn   t  occurred to me. I   m a big advocate of blooming where you   re planted  and people said I could serve in District 48 and I gave it 150 percent.  And then term limits were     And then term limits came into play.  This is a permanent   your lifetime appointment?  Oh, where I am now? Yes, which is kind of nice. I still pinch myself and  think,    Wow.    It   s quite a     And are there other women in Oklahoma that hold a similar     Our current Chief Judge here in the Western District of Oklahoma is  Judge Robin Cothran. And I will become the Chief Judge next year in  2008. A little soon, but some of the judges   it   s a matter of seniority.  Judge David Russell is our senior, he is still on active status. And two  judges that were in line ahead of me took senior status and did not  become Chief Judge so that   s why I   m probably fourteen years earlier  than I otherwise would have been.  And how long can you hold that position?  Seven years. So I   ll be doing that     So you know what you   ll be doing the next seven years.  I know what I   ll be doing and it   s a wonderful   I love our court here in  the Western District of Oklahoma. As I go to national training meetings  and so forth, the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Center sponsors a  lot of our training and continuing education is made available through  the Federal Judiciary Center out of Washington D.C. And so you get to  know many of your colleagues around the country through training and  other meetings that we attend. I know that our court here in the Western  District is exceptionally collegial, which is not always the case  unfortunately. But you know you are a body joined together by the  narrow confines of your existence. You are constitutional existence and  there are many limitations as there should be and the framers were  probably quite astute when they created a lot of the restrictions. But  32  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  there should be a lot of restrictions. And they make sense and I certainly  understand the reasons why they exist but they kind of narrow your  world. They really do, but as they probably should in a position that a  person can hold for life. The Constitution says it   s a lifetime  appointment or so long as they still have good behavior and it has been  interpreted in the case law. Obviously if somebody commits a crime or  so forth they are not going to get to hold that very coveted position  anymore. But it   s work of tremendous responsibility.  Do you think you would have gotten there without having served time in  the Senate?  Well you see, it   s just not a typical route   it   s not a typical route.  If it   s destiny it would have come anyway, wouldn   t it?  Only the good Lord knows that, from my vantage point. (Laughs) But  you know     So the next step after this is what? What would be the next     I don   t know. I just like to bloom where I   m planted, Dr. Finchum.  (Laughs) I don   t know.  I   d say you   re blooming quite well.  (Laughs) Do good where I am. I   ve had an opportunity   federal courts  are courts of very limited jurisdiction. We do handle both civil and  criminal cases by statute, but one of the exceptional opportunities that  I   ve enjoyed as a member of the federal courts, federal courts govern  themselves through an entity called the Judicial Conference of the  United States and the conference is chaired by the Chief Justice. And  there are a number of committees that make up the Judicial Conference  of the United States. The Criminal Law Committee, the State Federal  Jurisdiction Committee, the Civil Procedure Committee, and the  International Judicial Relations Committee which is a committee of  judges that respond to all kinds of requests, from foreign judiciaries on  matters pertaining to the administration of justice or the rule of law.  You might think,    Oh, that   s going to be traveling.    No, nothing was  ever sexy on that committee. You went to very challenged, developing  countries. I did quite a bit of work with the Law Reform and Law  Revision Committee, Commission of the Republic of Rwanda, post-genocide.  I got to do work in Kenya and South America and we were not  the only judges. Many state court judges also assist our foreign  colleagues. There was nothing sexy about that committee. But it was an  33  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  extraordinary opportunity to be able to   whether that judge is in Brazil,  which is where I   ve had an opportunity to do work, or in China. I   m not  on the committee anymore because you can only serve two three-year  terms because they encourage judges, all of us in the federal judiciary to  do some service on a Judicial Conference Committee. I still get  contacted by the Public Diplomacy section of the State Department to do  work. And I don   t do as much of it as I did during that six-year window.  I think I   m a better judge in America because of the opportunity to do  some of that work around the globe. And you never know kind of what  the request is. And like I said, the federal court is not the only group of  judges responding to those kinds of requests. But a lot is certainly done  through the goodwill of that committee. And the sharing, the exchange  about how we do what we do. Whether it   s in the area of court  administration or another area. You have civil law jurisdictions and  common law jurisdictions. America is obviously a common law  jurisdiction so you   ve got vast differences in kind of doing the day-to-day  depending on the origins of that country   s laws. So it   s been a very  fascinating and interesting aspect of my work during that period of time.  It has kind of piqued some interest in me that I didn   t even know I had.  Your skill set that you have learned on the way is still coming into play.  We   re running out of time for you.  Probably.  One last question. I   ve asked all the other ones, I need to ask you. When  history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  That she served with a passion. Really. That   s why I feel so privileged  and so blessed because I haven   t been anywhere professionally that I just  haven   t   just kind of marveled in and just really cherished the  opportunity to serve because that   s what it is. The voters gave it to me in  those seven and a half years or so in the Oklahoma State Senate and I  think what I was entrusted with is something very sacred, and something  very special. And I worked every day at the Oklahoma Senate like I  believed that it was something that was very precious to me   that trust.  And it didn   t mean everybody liked me because they didn   t. (Laughs)  My grandmother used to say, just read the paper everyday and think,     Oh, gosh, that doesn   t look very nice.    That horrible person they were  making me out to be. And sometimes you just had to say well today, my  grandmother used to say,    Today   s headlines are tomorrow   s fish  wrappings.    That   s just part of it. Everybody signed on the line for you  and I grew some very big skin during that period of time. I mean, if you  take it personally, you don   t need to be in any kind of elected position  because most of what it was   was not about who you were, but about  34  Finchum  Miles-LaGrange  what you were advocating. It kind of goes back to that interest. What is  the interest being advocated here?  And as U.S. Attorney, that was an awesome job with awesome  responsibility, the decision to charge or to not charge a person. The  discretion involved in that was very   again, a very sacred kind of trust  that requires the deliberation, that requires good evidence   that requires  a whole different set of skills. I think in all of my professional career, the  public trust that has been entrusted because I   ve had a very public  career. I   m not a wealthy person by any means. I mean, anybody that  wants to be rich, I tell them, I tell young people,    If you want to make a  lot of money, government is not your venue.    It   s just not. And now the  courts, the federal courts   the trust. The oath that I took to honor the  constitution, to follow the law   that   s an awesome   it doesn   t matter  what I think, what Vicki thinks. Each one of these positions, what Vicki  thinks becomes less and less important in the scheme of things. But  what   s entrusted is overwhelming. And when you really think about it,  when I really think about it, sometimes I think,    Whoa, it   s a lot.    It   s a  big load   it   s a big load but I honor it, I cherish it, I respect it, and I  revere it. I just hope that that   s what I will be remembered for, is being  passionate about my service, my public service.  I   d say you   ve accomplished it. Thank you for your time.  Okay, thank you.  --- End of December 17, 2007 Interview ---
