Speaker 1: Now, before we get into depth, there are five People Magazine-ish type questions--that we always ask, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Probably--it's a draw; either sushi or fried chicken, either one.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring; my birthday's around--March 24th, and I like that time of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I'm just learning about vacations; didn't take very many of 'em growing up, and I'm, I'm, I'm into my second marriage now, and my wife likes vacations, so I'm getting accustomed to Jamaica.  We've been there several times; in fact, we were married in Jamaica, so I'm learning to like Jamaica, but never--never had a preference for vacations; never went on very many of 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying--I've got a lot of favorite phrases or sayings; let me think of one that, that I really like.  I'll get back to you; I can't--I can't think of any that really jumps out.  I'm a great reader of the life and philosophy of soldiers, and I especially like eastern philosophy, and eastern war; I like the readings of Miyamoto Musashi, and so some of the things that Musashi wrote in his Book of Five Rings are very important to me, so I, I read that kinda stuff a lot, and all of that is very useful to me.  I also pay attention to Machiavelli; he is a very important philosopher, and people--people denigrate the name Machiavelli and, and, and refer to the syndrome of Machiavellianism as if it's a mean and rotten thing, but this Machiavelli had his head on straight in terms of his knowledge of people, and I thought that reading some of his stuff, having to do with whether it's better be--for you to loved--very, very important.  And of course he said, you know, it's--you know, although it would be best to be feared and loved, it is--it is probably best to be feared if you want to be prince.  And I, I thought that--I thought that some of that was, was very good.  He also said that--I mean he was living in a different era, and so his perspective about women was much different than our perspective would be today, but one of the things he said was that "Good fortune is like a woman and sometimes you must take her by force."  Now, that has absolutely no application to today, but it gave you a perception of, of, of his approach to life.  You make your own luck; you don't wait until somebody blesses you with good fortune, you take good fortune.  So some of that stuff seeps into the way I operate on a day-in and day-out basis.  I was also very impressed with Malcolm X; he was a great hero of mine, and I grew up watching and reading and following everything he did or said, and I have several of the albums--the Message to the Grassroots, and the Ballot or the Bullets and, you know, the things he said about integration for example.  I remember him saying that when they integrated the March on Washington, they--they watered it down; they, they, they added so many people who were not black that it, it lost its fervor and it lost its, its, its tension, and it lost its urgency.  And he gave the example that it's like you have black coffee and if it's too dark and it's too strong, what do you do?  You integrate it with cream.  And he said, "It used to be strong, it becomes weak, it used to be dark it becomes light, it used to wake you up and now it'll put you to sleep."  And I, I remember that.  So there are several--there are several favorite sayings that I have and they run through my mind at all times; I'm, I'm always aware of all of those, all of those philosophers and all of those great leaders and, and I have great respect for all of what they've brought to my life, and it's very important.

Speaker 1: Let's talk about your background.  Can you give me the names of your parents and their birthdates, and please spell their names for us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I can give you my mother's.  My mother was Edith Marie Crawley, and she was born on September 16th, 1927.  She passed three years ago, but my father, his name was Joseph McHerrin, and I don't know when he was born.  And I think that he may still be alive, but he didn't play a very big role in my life.  He would come around periodically to see me.  My mother and father weren't married, and he would come around periodically, and I remember that I felt my name was Cutty 'cause I guess that was a slang term that, that people used back in those days, and when he would see me, he would say, "Hey, Cutty, how are you doing?"  And I, I, I thought my name was Cutty; I didn't know it was a slang term, like young people say dawg, and how we used to say cat, but he said Cutty, and that's as much as I know about him.  I knew he lived in West Philadelphia, and I knew that he was involved in some nefarious activities, but don't know him at all.  And, as I said, I saw him on the street about six months ago, we didn't speak; we looked at each other, I went my way and he went his.
Speaker 1: Do you think he recognized you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I'm sure he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, hmm.  That's deep.
Speaker 2: I remember, I remember he was somewhat of a loan shark, and when I was in college my senior year, I was running short of money.  I was in college with National Defense student loans and state grants and, you know, the whole mosaic of monies that you patch together to go to college, and I remember calling my mother from the fraternity house and I said, "Ma, I need another $500.00.  What can I do?"  And she said, "I don't have it; why don't you ask your father?"  And I said, "Well, I don't have his number."  And she gave me his phone number, and I called him and I said, "You know, I really do need $500.00 to finish this last year at St. Joseph's University."  He said, "Well, you know, if I loan you the money, then that money's not on the street and I'm not makin' money on it, and so I'm gonna have to charge you some rates."  And I said, "That's okay, thanks," and hung up on him.  And that was the last conversation we had.  So--no, I don't know his birthdate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How does that relationship of him--how did it affect you for the future?  I mean did you make any resolution about what kind of a father that you would be one day, based on that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, for one thing, I grew up with other male role models; I mean the male role models were Martin Luther King [Jr.] and Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael, and all those people whose voices I heard and whose images I saw growing up in the '60s [1960s]; they, they were the people who shaped me, so--and, and I grew up in public housing, and in the public housing complex that I lived in, that was not an unusual situation, and so most of my friends also didn't have fathers who lived with them.  The guy who lived upstairs from me--I lived in 710, Apartment A, and he lived in 710, Apartment C, and his mother had three children; my mother eventually had six, but his mother had three children and there was no father there, and so it was perfectly natural for us not to have a man who lived in the house.  And, more often than not, with, with the other people who lived in public housing, that was a situation of--female heads of household were the norm, so we, we didn't feel in any way put out by it or about it, it just was the way things were.
Story_ID: 67393
Speaker 1: It's interesting--what's running through my mind is when I came in and looked at the photos and stuff; there's a lot of photos of you and your son--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and the young lady was showing us the photos and said that "They're like twins, they're always together" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)----He's in Georgia now, so we're not together --
Speaker 1: Okay, but--
Speaker 2: --he's at Georgia Tech.
Speaker 1: --the way she put it, I mean you have a commitment, you know, a strong commitment to your son, apparently, and from what I can see in the photos and what she said; I mean the way she said it and the way she smiled when she said it, you know, so--you apparently have a different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, I had a, I had a very strong upbringing; there wasn't a father there, but my mother was, was very strong, and my grandmother was equally, if not stronger and I, I learned a lot about child rearing from them, and his mother and I are not together; I've been re-married, but I, I thought it was the most important thing in the world to make my son a responsible young man, to give him what he needed to be strong, to be able to cope with--with this environment, to be aware of the challenges, the special challenges that the world holds for African American men; I thought it was very important, and I remember takin' him down--when he was seven, we went to the Reenactment of the Freedom Ride 'cause I was about--his mother wanted him to go to a school that I wasn't especially pleased about; it was a prep school, and I said, "Whatever the school is, I'll pay for it, you know; nothing can be too good for my son.  The only school I don't want him to go to is Chestnut Hill Academy."  I'd seen other African American young men go to Chestnut Hill Academy and get confused culturally and not know who they were and, and come out frustrated and, and, and so I didn't want that to happen to him.  And so, of course, she called me back a couple of weeks later and said, "Well, I just enrolled him in Chestnut Hill Academy." So I, I, I thought that we needed a crash program to make sure that he was gonna be okay.  So we signed up for the Reenactment of the Freedom Ride the Martin Luther King Association does, so we got on the train--he was seven; we got on the train and we went down to Birmingham and to Montgomery and rode the bus to Selma and marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and we made him take pictures and write captions under each photo and, you know, we--an, an ongoing process of one, making him aware of who he was, and letting him know that, that he would always have somebody in his corner, but that he also had responsibility as a young man; it wasn't always peaches and cream.  And sometimes my son and I had harsh words about--young people often, when their mothers or fathers aren't together, they try to play one parent against the other, and that's a special challenge for both parents, so we had words about that from time to time.  But he's a good son, a strong young man, and down in his fourth year at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] has a full track scholarship, and had 1390 SATs, so I'm very proud of him.
Story_ID: 67394
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother.  What did she do for a living, and what was she like?
Speaker 2: My mother was a great woman; she was a school crossing guard.  She had six kids--four boys and two girls, and she raised them essentially by herself.  She was married to Morris Jenkins, and Morris was a person who had a chemical dependency--alcoholic beverages, but he couldn't drink alcohol; he couldn't do it, and he worked for the YWCA; he was a maintenance man, and so he would work during the day, work hard hours, wasn't a very highly educated man; I don't know if he ever graduated from high school.  But on the weekends, on that Friday, he would get paid in cash and go to the bar--this bar called the Village Bar around the corner from where we lived.  We could look out our back window in the projects and see the Village Bar, and he would go there, and all it took was a quart of beer or so, and Morris, whose nickname was Chiz [ph.]--Chiz would go berserk and he would come in and be very, very abusive.  My mother was strong, and she, she dealt with that until--until I became fourteen and we put him outta the house, but--but up until that point, she, she went through a lot to raise those six kids.  She, on the other hand, was a school crossing guard.  I remember finding one of her old paystubs not too long ago; it was $55.00 a week and I'm thinkin', 'How do you raise six children, even back then, on $55.00 a week?'  And she did it, she taught us values, she--I remember her getting her big promotion; she went from being a school crossing guard to a meter maid.  When the City of Philadelphia introduced meter maids, she was one of the first ten, and they had her picture in the paper with the new meter maid uniform on, and they had her working down in the Italian market; she was a great woman and a firm disciplinarian and taught each of us to be responsible and to move out when you were eighteen, so one by one, every one of us--I thought it was just me--I was the oldest, but when each of her children got to be a certain age, they had to have had enough sense of a responsibility to, to go out and make it on their own.  I remember I had one brother--still have that brother, brother Wendell, who's right behind me, and Wendell was very resistant; she was probably most kind to him, so he was the one who got the message more slowly than the others, and when she went out in the morning to go to write tickets on her job, Wendell would go outta the house, pretend he was going to West Philadelphia High School, 'cause we had moved to West Philadelphia at that time, and he would come back into the house and stay around the house all day and not go to school; and my mother found out, and I remember one morning--we had those old wooden bunk beds and you separate 'em and you have two twins, and Wendell was asleep in the bed and my mother had her full uniform on, and she was about to leave the house but I guess she got fed up with this Wendell behavior, and he felt the bed shaking--that morning the bed was shaking, and he opened his eyes and he looked, and there was my mother in her meter maid uniform with a hatchet in her hand; she was chopping the legs off the bed, and she said, "You won't sleep here anymore, young man" .  My brother got up, went to school, joined the army, got his GED, and he has been working at least two jobs ever since.  But that was the kind of disciplinarian she was, and that's how she was so well able to, to raise six kids.
Speaker 1: Now, were both your mother and father from Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother was from Philadelphia, my father lived in West Philadelphia.  My mother was originally in West Philadelphia, too; she had gone up through the 11th grade to West Philadelphia High School, and my father lived out in West Philadelphia, but my mother's mother, Nana, moved to Richard Allen Housing Projects, and my mother moved with her to North Philadelphia, and so I, I don't remember having lived in West Philadelphia in the early stages.  My mother eventually moved back to West Philadelphia when I was nineteen, but I grew up entirely in North Central Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 67395
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother or your grandmother let you know about where their side of the family came from?   (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, yeah--no, no, we, we've gone through--you know, with the roots and the genealogy studies, we've been through a lot of that and we've got family on my mother's side that trace back to parts of Virginia.  My grandfather, my grandmother's husband, his name was Theodore Roosevelt Crawley and, you know, there was the era when a lot of African Americans were named after presidents, so Theodore Roosevelt Crawley was a resident of Smithfield, Virginia, and then on the, on the--on my mother's side of the family, their family traces back to Winston Salem, North Carolina, and Tobacco, and those plantations, and that kind of thing, that's how far back we got.  We haven't gotten back any further than that, but we've got all of that information.  There are some Carey's in our family, too; I was shocked to find out, in the past couple of years, as we've looked through that material, there was a woman, Julia Etta Carey, who was one of my mother's ancestors, and she had a brother named Lott Carey, and I, I, I didn't know who Lott Carey was, and we were raised Catholic so I didn't know about the Baptist experience; and I found out that Lott Carey was a missionary who went to Liberia in the 1830s and we're still trying to follow up on that connection, but he's in the family tree.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I heard of Lott Carey (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, yeah.  I've been amazed at how much he has done, and we just--our firm just did a project for the Foreign Mission Board of the National Baptist Convention, and in there was a whole treatment of Lott Cary's contribution to the Foreign Mission Board in Liberia, so it was especially important to me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think he's related to Mary Ann Shadd Carey--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm
Speaker 1: --who was from--who was raised in New England, lived in Canada, was the editor of the Provincial Freeman of Canada, and then later became the first black woman lawyer in the United States, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--that's the--that was a relative of Mary Ann Shadd Cary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--There's a lot of information--just been a book written about her, yeah.  It's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So did you know anything about where your father's people were from?
Speaker 2: No; I know nothing at all about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Tell me, did they have a story behind--I mean did your mother ever talk about how she met your father in the first place?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't talk about it a lot; I assume that they met each other at West Philadelphia High School, and I never asked very many questions about it and she didn't volunteer very much information, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, he didn't really play a role in my life, so it wasn't an issue.
Story_ID: 67396
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in--say, the Richard Allen Projects.
Speaker 2: It was, it was fun; I mean we didn't know we were poor; we had no concept of how the rest of the world lived, so we thought this was it, and we, we, we thoroughly enjoyed everything we did.  We played games--many of the games were created by us; I mean we didn't have games that you purchased , but we did play baseball, it was with a broom handle and a pimple ball, but we didn't have a lot of equipment but we enjoyed playing together.  I guess, I guess the big issue for us was that over time, as we began to, to grow, gangs became to be more and more prevalent in the housing project, and the city stopped investing in the quality of maintenance in the projects.  I remember when we grew up, the housing projects had grass--plots of grass, and they would come up once a year with seeds, and in spring you would dig and plant your grass seeds and people would put flowers in, and this was in public housing and it wasn't bad.  But over time, I guess as we tried to seek efficiencies, they stopped doing that; they, they came around and put cement over all the places that had the grass, and we used to play marbles when you couldn't play marbles anymore 'cause it was cement.  And there was a place--a nice place where you, you put trash and garbage, you know, if you had to do that, but it was in a place we used to call the Trash House and another one called the Garbage House.  And there were cans there, and you'd go in and you would drop your things and move on.  In trying to be more efficient and to save money over time, they removed those things and put in dumpsters, and the dumpsters didn't get picked up very frequently, and so you couldn't get to the dumpster to dump off your trash so people started throwing their trash in the general direction of the dumpster because there was trash all around.  And so the neighborhood started to look really bad; they didn't clean it the way they used to, and it wasn't preserved as well, and then here came drugs, so we had gangs, drugs, dilapidated conditions and--and I'm sure this is a phenomenon that happened all over the country with public housing but, but it happened in Richard Allen.  And there were, there were 1400 units--1400 families living in Richard Allen Housing Project, in a very dense area; it went from Fairmount to Poplar.  There was Fairmount, Brown, Parish, Poplar, and it went from Ninth Street to 12th; so three blocks square, 1300 families live in that area, so it was very dense.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(Unclear).
Speaker 2: There were some--mid-rise--four-stories was the highest they went, but most of 'em were low-rise, three units to each, to each complex; to each front door, there were three units, one on the first floor and two upstairs.  But, you know, we enjoyed it, we didn't--and it wasn't until I grew up and started to go out of the neighborhood to go to parties in, in better neighborhoods that I realized that this was a bad place; I had no sense of that.  I would go to parties in, in Germantown and Mount Airy and the girls would say, "Well, you guys really are nice, you dance real well, I like the way you dress; where are you from?"  We'd say, "North Philadelphia."  And they would go upstairs and tell their parents and the parents would come down and say--I remember clearly, one day the parents came down and said, "Boys and girls, the party is over." And we said, "Okay," and we left and the door shut behind us and the music came back on.  We didn't realize that, that our neighborhood had such a bad reputation; people were being shot, there was a--you know, I guess at some level, you know, relative to other communities, it was, it was considered dangerous but for us, it was all we knew, and--good friends there, and even 'til today, we have reunions.  My firm does the PR [Public Relations] for the Annual Richard Allen Picnic; we have that every year in August, in Fairmount Park, and it's always good to see the people I grew up with, and we stay in very close contact.  We had a, a demonstration today in front of the Philadelphia Daily News because we were concerned, I'm chairman of the African American Chamber of Commerce--and we've been concerned about the anti-Philadelphia and racially divisive news coverage in the Philadelphia Daily News, and one of the first calls I got when we put out the word that we were forming a coalition to address the issue was from people in Richard Allen who said, "Bruce, you know--hey, if you're gonna do something, we're with you; give me the information."  And, of course, out there this morning was Billy Brown and Warren Boo Boo Summers [ph.] and--you know, so these are good friends; they will always be friends.
Story_ID: 67397
Speaker 1: What kind of a youngster were you when you were small?  What were you interested in?
Speaker 2: I, I was, I was--I guess, a standard issue Richard Allen youngster except that I was a Catholic and I didn't know I was Catholic.  When I was born, my mother's best friend--my mother went to West Philadelphia High School, and her best friend was a woman by the name of--young lady by the name of Gloria Dixon, and Gloria went to West Catholic School for Girls and she was a Catholic, and when I was born, my mother wanted to have me christened and Gloria, her friend, who obviously was very persuasive, said, "Well, why don't you have him baptized Catholic," and my mother's--"Okay."  So that was it; I was baptized a Catholic, and I knew nothing at all about that until it was time to go to the first grade, and when all of my friends went to the first grade, I ran in the house and said, "Ma, it's time to go to school, where's my clothes?  When do I go to school?  Everybody's in the first grade."  She said, "No, you're Catholic, you don't go to that school."  I said, "Well, what school do I go to?"  She said, "I'll take you tomorrow."  And she walked me up three blocks away to Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament, which was a school that was taught by missionary nuns.  The--Mother Catherine Drexel, who was just made a Saint by the Catholic Church, was a founder of that order and they taught in Tanzania and Arizona, the Pueblo Indians, and in North Philly, so they rotated .  So we, we were a part of their mission and they were saving our heathen souls.  So I went up to that school and I found out I was Catholic and I was in the first grade and--you know, it's funny how I reflect on that.  You hear people talking about public schools today and how there shouldn't be no more than twenty-some odd kids per class, and an ideal class is maybe twelve to fifteen; we had seventy-two kids in the first grade -seventy-two.  We had a tremendous (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(Inaudible response).
Speaker 2: Seventy-Two kids; and the drop-out rate was horrendous (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I was in school--it was probably the same generation--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --baby boomer generation--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and where I was, we had like a--over forty, and then we were told that that was really crowded.  Seventy-Two (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Seventy-Two, seventy-two kids; I'll never forget that.  And by the time I got--it was first through eighth; by the time I got to the eighth grade, when I graduated from Our Lady of Blessed Sacrament, there were eight of us--six boys and two girls.  And, and, and you can get an education in the Catholic school because if they didn't like you, they'd put you out , and so sixty-four people, knowing that, were bounced from that school, and six boys and two girls graduated, you know; weren't always the same eight, but there were eight on that--at the end of the, the eight-year period.  So it was an interesting experience.
Story_ID: 67398
Speaker 1: I was talking about the, the Catholic school, and I guess the, the big impact in my life was a sister--the nun in the first grade, her name was Sister Mary Anna; I'll never forget her because part-way through the school year, we had to read from the primer and in the Catholic school we had David and Ann, and--see David, see Ann, see Spot, see Spot run, go, go David--you know, that kind of stuff.  And part-way through the school year, Sister Mary Anna came to me after class one day and said, "You know, you read very well and I want you to take home this second grade reading book and practice with it and bring it back and let me know how well you can do, and I'll work with you privately."  I said to myself, "She must be crazy, I'm havin' a tough time with this See Spot Run thing; this is very difficult. She thinks I can read this second grade book--no way."  And I took it home and I told my mother, I said, "She wants me to read this second grade book."  She said, "Well, she must think you can do it; go read the second grade book."  And I went home and I went in my room and I cried; I said, "I can't do this stuff, she's crazy."  And, you know, I struggled through it, came back to school and went haltingly through all these words, and she said, "That's great; you can read, you're a really good reader."  And I started looking at comic books in a whole different way 'cause we used to have comic books and we used to look at the pictures, my friends and I, and I started reading what was in these little boxes and these little clouds over the characters' heads, and my friends started saying, "Bruce, you know what they're saying to each other?"  And I said "Yeah."  And I would come outside and we'd sit on the big step in the project and I would read the comic books to my friends, and, and some of the older kids would come around, too, and they would say, "Bruce, read this" and I would read Superman and Donald Duck.  It was a really strange thing, and, and, and I think back to that because it was just that woman saying, "You can read this book," and I had no concept that I could, and now I--you know, I have a real clear sense of how important it is to give young people motivation, to let them have a sense of their potential because that made all the difference in my life.  At that point, I began to believe that I knew how to do things--that I had some skill, and started winning spelling bees and getting good grades and, you know, it was, it was fun.  I had a good time doing that.
Story_ID: 67399
Speaker 1: I was on the CYO [Catholic Youth Organization] Basketball Team and the track team; I won the citywide broad jump competition in the seventh grade.  It's funny, I, I didn't do long jump in high school--I was on the track team, but I went away from long jump after I did the citywide broad jump championship, and my son wound up years later, when he was at Chestnut Hill Academy, he said, "Dad, I'm going out for the track team," and I said, "Well, now, that's great, you know who ran track?"  He said, "No."  I said, "I ran track."  He said, "Yeah, well, I think I wanna go out and be a jumper."  I said, "You know who used to jump?"  I used to. He wound up being a high school All-American jumping.  So, you know, it, it, it's really strange how those things all tie together, but that, that, that school experience really opened my eyes and, and pointed me off in a good direction.  Wound up going from there to take a scholarship exam at St. Joseph's Preparatory School which is a Jesuit school, and I had no interest in going there; I wanted to go to the school with my friends at Roman Catholic, which was the neighborhood Catholic school, or to Ben Franklin, the neighborhood public high school, and my mother knew that she couldn't win an argument with me over that, and so she said, "I'll give you $15.00 if you pass the test and get the scholarship," and that was a lotta money; you remember my mother made $55.00 a week.  And I think I aced that exam; they gave me the scholarship and, to the day she died, my mother never paid me that $15.00.  But it was, it was, it was a good motivator , and I wound up, again, going through an educational experience that wasn't exactly pleasant for me because there were, there were all these really bright young white boys in this school; it was a all-male school, taught by Jesuits, who are known as disciplinarians in the Catholic church.  The head of the Jesuits is called the Father General; I mean these guys are tough guys and, and I went into the first grade--into the ninth grade and there were all these white kids and four blacks, including myself, and two of them flunked out after the first semester of ninth grade, and the guy who was left had a mother and father who both had master's degrees and he was very light-complected and they thought--his name was Romero, so they never knew he was black .  So I didn't speak to him for the first three years that we were in high school 'cause I, I tried to talk to him one day and he talked entirely differently than I did; I mean I, I could spell and I could read and, you know, I could write great paragraphs and, you know, I did all that stuff, but I couldn't speak English 'cause I never had to.  Outside of the classroom, I spoke what people in Richard Allen spoke, and so when I tried to speak to these young white boys, it didn't come out straight, and I could see them looking at me and thinking, 'Boy, you must really be stupid,' and it was just that I didn't speak English.  And, again, it was a great experience to go to that school and to watch and hear people actually speak conversational English to each other 'cause nobody in my neighborhood ever did.  I mean we spoke--communicated with each other very well, but it was slang, it was patois; it wasn't the English that they spoke in St. Joseph's Prep, so by the time I got out in the fourth--after four years there, I could speak English, but I was not an English speaker when I went to that school. And this guy Tony Romero was an English speaker in the ninth grade, and so when I tried to speak to him and said, "You must be from somewhere else, and so I can't relate to you."  And he finally wound up going out for the track team when I was on the track team, and we began to speak and turned out to be a great guy; he's a doctor out in Seattle [Washington].  He's one of the nicest, the most dedicated people I've ever met in my life.  One day--when we graduated from college--we went to the same college, he went down to Raymondville, Texas to be a physician, and I asked him, "Why Raymondville, Texas, Tony?  What are you thinking?"  He said--he looked on a, on, on some kind of a demographic profile of all the cities and towns in the country, and he looked for the place that had the lowest ratio of doctors to people who were residents, and that was Raymondville, Texas, so he went there to do that; this guy was a missionary.  I didn't speak to him for three years.  I, I really have great respect for him.

Speaker 1: Now, did you ever have any trouble with gangs?
Speaker 2: No.  You know, when I was in--when I was in--I could always fight.  My--one thing that my father did when I was very young, when I was about four or five years old--five or six years old, I told you he would come by on weekends and, "Hey, Cutty," and take me out every now and then, but he introduced me to his cousin, a guy named Dorsey Lay; Dorsey Lay was the number one lightweight contender in the world; he wound up being blinded in the ring--detached retinas--but he was a very good fighter, and as a kid, he would show me how to box and all that stuff.  So I never had any problems with, with, with defending myself in that way.  And then, when I was in the sixth grade, the, the guy who ran the biggest gang in the projects, the 12th and Poplar Street Gang, a guy named Louis Tyler Brown--we called him Lou T.  Lou T began--was transferred to the Catholic school, and I remember I was like the pretty influential person in that Catholic school and--you know, you had to come through me if you wanted to be important.  So Lou T --Lou T said, "Who's the toughest guy in this school?"  And they said, "Well, you have to talk to Bruce."  And I remember Lou T challenged me to a fight, and this guy could really fight; I mean it wasn't something he learned at five or six; he was the War Lord of the 12th and Poplar Street Gang.  And, and he was slapping because, you know, we were boxing in the school yard with open hand slaps and he was very, very good.  And all of my friends broke in and said, "Look, Bruce, we'll help you."  And he beat them to a pulp; this guy was so strong; he became my, my best friend in school.  Lou T wound up--when we, when we left Our Lady of Blessed Sacrament at the age of 16, he'd gotten tired of high school and lied about his age and joined the U.S. Army and became a tail gunner in the Airborne--in the 82nd Airborne Division; all kinds of purple hearts, bronze stars--war hero.  Interesting story about Lou T I can tell you later, but wound up not being able to support his family when he came home from the war because, you know, at that time, if you were a Vietnam War vet, people thought you were crazy and didn't wanna give you a job, and I remember Lou T said--called me up and said, "Bruce, you know I--can you help me get a job?  You know, I've got my kids and my wife," and I called a guy that I knew who had a business down at Ten Pen Center around 16th and Market, and he said he had a job in the mail room.  I said, "Lou T"--he said, "Any job, fine--mail room, I'll do that."  And he called me up six months into the job and said, "Bruce,"--I was at the bank at the time; I was working with First Pennsylvania Bank.  He said, "Bruce, look, I don't wanna disrespect you and I don't want you to get upset or angry, but there's a guy here who's really getting on my nerves and he's disrespecting me and talking down to me as a black man, and I'm gonna have to knock him out" .  He said, "I'll probably lose my job."  I said, "Well, Lou T, you have to do what you have to do." And he knocked the guy out and he got fired, and he couldn't get re-employment.  He wound up in desperation, getting a gun and going into this supermarket at 10th and Brown, which was across the street from the projects.  A guy, Max, who we all knew--we grew up going to Max's Supermarket; Lou T walked in with a pistol and said, "Max, give it up."  And Max pulled out his pistol and shot Lou T and Lou T went to Holmesburg [Prison]; came out after a couple of years and got a job--we helped him get a job in the school district, and he's maintenance supervisor, runs several schools, and he's responsible for that and always was a bright guy, always was a smart guy.  But, you know, the Vietnam War put him in a very bad situation.  But he was my best friend and, and, and as we got into seventh, eighth grade at Our Lady of Blessed Sacrament--so I hung out with Lou T and wherever I went after school, where, where, wherever the gang went, wherever the 12th and Poplar went, when 12th and Poplar went to the movies, we all went together, when we went downtown, we all went together, and I never had any problems with gangs; they were my best friends.

Speaker 1: So what other activities were you involved in in high school?
Speaker 2: I was in a band until I got put out in junior year for insubordination; I was a trumpet player and--I was first trumpet, and I was in the marching band, the dance band, concert band, and on one day, I remember the priest, Father Pickla [ph.], saying to me that we had to, as a band, go to a parade in a predominantly white community and it was on a holiday, it was on Memorial Day, and we all had to wear our marching uniforms and go to the parade.  I said, "Father, you don't understand, I can't do that; every Memorial Day, everybody in the projects goes to Willow Grove Amusement Park--a standing commitment; I go every year, my friends go, I'm going to Willow Grove."  And he said, "Well, if you don't go, if you don't come to the parade, I'm putting you outta the band."  And so I thought, 'He can't put me out; I'm first trumpet' they won't have a trumpet section, the band will collapse without me.  And, you know, I went to Willow Grove and I came back and they kicked me outta the band and I started my own band; we called ourselves the Jamaica Rums, and we played little gigs at the high schools.  We, we, we stayed together for a while; it was a good little group but--so I was in a band and I ran track cross country.  That's pretty much what I did, you know, played schoolyard basketball and that kinda stuff, but always working.  My mother--it was, it was important to work, and when I was ten, eleven, started selling shopping bags; would go downtown with a nickel, go to the Reading Terminal, it's a farmer's market, and they had a paper goods place there; with a nickel you could buy one double-handled shopping bag, and you would get that shopping bag, you go out on the corner of Market Street where the shoppers were, sell that bag for a dime, and you go back and buy two, you sell those, come back and buy four.  That was my first real serious hustle.  And then my mother got me a job working at Raisman's, it was a toy store on the outskirts of the projects, and every Christmas, the families in the housing projects bought all their toys from Raisman's and my mother bought so many toys when she had no money; I don't know--she stayed in debt all year long; she was so good to her children, but we had to have a good Christmas; she made sure that we had a good Christmas, and so one year, I guess when I was twelve, she said, "Mr. Raisman, can my son work here in preparation for the Christmas holiday?"  And so, two weeks out, every Christmas, I worked at Raisman's; I was a stock boy, I assembled the bicycles, I did--and as we got closer and closer to Christmas, we delivered the toys to the houses of the projects and every year, the last delivery was my mom's house so it was, it was fun; it was a good job.  But--always working; had to work.  My mother wouldn't accept anything other than that.
Story_ID: 67402
Speaker 1: Now, were you thinking about what--did you have any career ideas in high school?  What did you think you'd be--you know--
Speaker 2: I had, I had absolutely no career ideas; I had no sense of what I wanted to be.  I knew I didn't wanna be a maintenance man at the YWCA, and I didn't wanna be a loan shark, so I, I didn't have any real sense; I certainly didn't wanna be a meter maid, so--there weren't very many male role models in the housing projects that had careers that you could emulate, or that you wanted to emulate, so when I went to this prep school, ninety-eight percent of the graduates had gone to college, but I never thought about going to college; I just thought I would graduate from the school and get a job or that my mother would force me to get a job, and the way I wound up applying to college at St. Joseph's College was that this Tony Romero who, by now, is on the track team; he was in the 12th grade, I was in the 12th grade--we sat next to each other in homeroom, and he came in one day and I heard the other guys talkin' among themselves about being accepted into college.  People were saying they were accepted into Princeton [University], accepted into Harvard [University], accepted into Villanova [University]; so I asked Tony, "What is this accepted thing"?  You know.  'Cause when I would talk to the school guidance counselor, he would only ask me about racial relations.  He would say, "How are you getting along with the other kids, Anthony?"  I mean he didn't know I hated that name; we never spoke.  "Anthony, how are you getting along with the other kids?"  "It's fine."  "Okay, goodbye."  I mean he didn't talk to me about career.  So, I said to Tony, "What are they talking about?"   And he said, "Well, you know, you fill out this application and you send it to the registrar's office at the university and they get a copy of your SAT scores and you're all"--everybody had to take the SAT at St. Joe's.  "And they take your SAT scores and you get accepted into the freshman class."  And I said, "Well, I can be accepted" He said, "Yeah, well, why don't you?"  And I said, "You have any of those applications?"  And he happened to have one; he had applied at Villanova [University] and St. Joe's [University].  He happened to have an extra St. Joseph's application, and I took it and I filled it out, and you had to have a picture, and it was a guy named Mack, who lived in the housing projects, who was an amateur photographer and he had a Polaroid camera and used to walk around.  I said, "Mr. Mack, take my picture," and he said, "You owe me $2.00."  I don't think I ever paid Mr. Mack.  He gave me the picture and I pasted it on the application and I sent it in.  And you had to check off, you know, what your area of interest was, and alphabetically the first was business and accounting, so I put accounting, business, and I applied for the freshman class.  And I got a letter back saying, "You're accepted" 'cause they got my board scores and so I said to Tony, "I'm accepted"  He said, "Well, good."  I had no money, I had no plan, I didn't know what accounting was --I had no idea; but, you know, when, when I got outta school--I remember at graduation, my mother gave me a gift and, you know, I was, I was hearin' all these other kids talkin' about what there were gonna get; they were getting cars, they were gonna get trips to Europe, you know, they were prep school kids, and I was--I started to get confused and I started thinking, 'Well, maybe my family's gonna get me something really nice.'  And my mom gave me a suitcase .  She said, "Here's your gift," and I said, "Well, what is this for?"  And she said, "You will either get a job, in which case you'll need this because you have to move, you know, you get a full eight-hour a day job, or you will join the army in which case you'll have to move, so either way you're gonna need this" .  I said, "Well, suppose I don't wanna go to Vietnam?"  She said, "Well, you know, you're gonna move one way or the other."  So, now I followed up on that acceptance letter ; I went up to the school and I said, "I don't have any money but I wanna go to this school; you accepted me."  And they explained about National Defense student loans and state grants and all that stuff, and I took the package home and, after a couple of weeks, my mother agreed to sign it, and I wound up going to St. Joseph's University.  And I was, I was an accounting major for the first year and a-half, until I found out what accountants actually do, and I told the professor that I wanted to do something where you had some impact on, on business planning and, and, and persuasion and those kinds of things, and he referred me to a book called Hidden Persuaders by Vance Packard, and told me about marketing, and I switched my major to marketing.  But that's how I got into college and stayed there primarily because I didn't want to go into the war, you know, so I, I maintained sufficient cumulative average to stay outta the draft, and I, and I prayed that the draft would be over before I graduated; that did not happen, and wound up having to go in to the service and I went into the army reserves and, matter of fact, the Jersey National Guard, and I was an artillery (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--When did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in 1963--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and from the--St. Joseph's in '67 [1967].
Story_ID: 67403
Speaker 1: And wound up going in up--I got a job at First Pennsylvania Bank.  I had told them that I was already in the reserves 'cause back then they, they weren't hiring people who were able-bodied male who, who were draft eligible; so I told 'em I was in the reserves already, and so they put me in the management training program and then I got this letter, after having taken my pre-induction physical; they sent a letter to my mother's house and said that, you know--'cause I had gotten a little apartment and they said that, "Greetings, you are now inducted in the U.S. Army," and I got into a reserve unit over in Jersey and wound up staying in the reserves for six years; got out in '74 [1974]--but, was interesting.  You know, it turned out to be a good experience there, being in the--on, on active duty for six months, you know.  You know you're not gonna be in Vietnam and so it wasn't the worst experience that people could have, but it was a good experience to be able to compare yourself and to compete with people from all over the country--people from Idaho and West Virginia; it was, it was--I, I really liked it, I really liked it.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you worked in the bank and--
Speaker 1: Emm-hmm (ph.).
Speaker 2: --what was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, I was a management trainee; started as a teller in the management training program, and at that time, the management training program was a five-year program which included work for a brief period of time in most of the major departments of the bank, and if you were any good, then over time they separated the best people out and put 'em in credit training for commercial credit, and the people who were marginal, they left in branch administration, so they became branch managers and that kinda thing.  The people who had more talent were brought into the commercial credit training program; commercial credit trainees were on a path to top management--senior management at least.  So I was in the credit department and wound up being in main office commercial loans as a--as an entry-level officer, and put all the time begging to get into the marketing function because that was my undergraduate degree.  And they finally let me in to do branch marketing; I went back to school, eventually went to professional school, took ten courses in journalism, in advertising, marketing and then I went back and got a master's degree in journalism and became ad director of the bank, became PR [Public Relations] director and senior vice president, and then left to start my own firm.  But--so for most of the time I was in the bank, I focused on marketing communications, but I had that, that one boot camp period when I had to learn how to be a banker and know how loans were made, and so it was, it was a good experience also; it was like another degree.
Story_ID: 67404
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any mentors (unclear), I mean people that really looked out for you and--
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I--you know--and, and I, I think it, it went two ways--one, I didn't have anybody volunteering to be a mentor, and two, you know, having read Machiavelli and all those other things, I was leery of being too closely attached to somebody who, of their own volition, for something that they had done wrong themselves, could get eliminated and I would be carried along with them simply because I was associated, so I was always a person who tried to establish his own career path, and I didn't necessarily want to be known as Joe's guy or Harry's guy or Mary's guy; I wanted to be a self-contained entity because I saw how vicious people could be in--in corporate life, and I saw people get fired and then they laid off everybody in their department, and I, and I wanted to be a person who, who they knew would work for anybody as long as--as long as I could work in my chosen profession, my allegiance was to the company and not to any one of the managers, so I didn't seek mentorship and, and, and I didn't think that I'd missed too much not having done that.  The people who had mentors got a guiding hand up to lower middle-management; beyond that, when you started to seek the kind of position that the mentor had, you got no help, and so it didn't help you very much anyway.  I, I had--my greatest challenges--at entry level in the bank where most people get mentors, it was easy because they were proud of you and they wanted to see you advance and here's our little black management trainee and look at him, isn't he good?  But then when you want the vice president's job and somebody already has that, then the mentors disappear; nobody wants to give away their own job or to see you be a real competitor for the next meaningful assignment.  So, mentorship, I think, is over-played; it gets too much credit, and I never think I missed it.  I, I left the bank as a senior vice president; it was 6,000 people in the corporation.  There were thirty-five people with senior vice president titles, and I was head of PR and Investor Relations and reported directly to the CEO.  So I, I, I didn't miss anything not having a mentor.  I think he trusted me more, knowing that I didn't have the agenda of some other ambitious person in my pocket, so it was, it was fun.
Story_ID: 67405
Speaker 1: Had you been involved in martial arts at this point?
Speaker 2: I, I started martial arts in 1970; I had gotten outta college in '67 [1967] and was working at the bank, but I was still going back and forth to the housing project 'cause that's where my friends were.  And we formed a club--we had a high school fraternity, Alpha Lambda Phi, and we partied a lot; that's what we did.  We had parties and we would raise money and sell dance tickets, and at the end of the year, we would go to Atlantic City and blow all the money--that's what we did; that was the philosophy of Alpha Lambda Phi.  But then when I got outta college, my friends had all gone to the service and they had started to get home from the service at the time that I finished college.  My service career started in '68 [1968]; they were out already because they didn't go to college.  But we started a group called Cacamayuja [ph.]--Brothers of Unity; we changed the name, we were more Afrocentric at that time, and we gave the same kinds of dances, but then we would give money and buy food for the poorest people in the projects; I mean we were poor ourselves, but there were people poorer than us and so we, we did these fundraising dances and, and, and we would follow what was happening in housing projects and, and, and you know that that was the period when, when services or resources were starting to be denied to public housing residents and, and when the windows were broken, nobody fixed 'em right away, and when the doors were hanging off the hinges, nobody fixed them right away, and we began to think that there was going to be some absorption of our neighborhood into what was an expanding Center City, and that everybody would be gentrified, moved out of the community and we, the young men of the community, said we would have to stand and stop this from happening, and we wouldn't let the people in our neighborhood be pushed out, so one day I said to them, "Let's all take martial arts  so that when this happens, we'll be able to defend our neighbors."  And so I took twelve guys out on that Monday; we used to meet on Sunday.  That Monday, I had seen this karate school--when I lived in my apartment before I went into the service, I'd seen this karate school; looked in the window and it looked interesting, so I told my friends, "Let's go."  So twelve of us signed up on that day and, and ten of 'em dropped out after the first two weeks  and, and--but I stayed in; I became a fourth degree black belt and was--fought in national competition, was in the world championships in '76 [1976] and '85 [1985], took--between '79 [1979] and '83 [1983], I was--I cut back on the martial arts 'cause I went back to get the master's degree in journalism and I came back and resumed my martial arts training and went back to the world championships again so--I really love it; it's, it's a great thing.  I had my son in it from the age of seven to fourteen, and it's very important to him, too.
Story_ID: 67406
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the black organization that you all started (unclear), what informed the organization?  I mean how did you--was there somebody in the community that was teaching like cultural stuff?
Speaker 2: A lotta that came from our barber; there was a barber--and impacted my studies at St. Joseph's [University], too.  His name was Roland, and he was a member of the Nation of Islam, and his Muslim name was Daud and in fact, Daud was a martial artist.  He, he was a black belt at that karate school; that's when I got my first exposure to that school; I looked in the window and I saw Daud in there and I asked him about it later.  But he went to Tuskegee and was a barber in the neighborhood, and when we would go in, he would always have somethin' to say; it was always a great learning experience, and so we would be happy if one of us--and we hung out eight or ten at a time, and if one of us needed a haircut, we were delighted because all ten of us then went to the barber shop and waited while that one guy got a haircut while Daud talked to us about life and about everything around us, and I remember him saying to us, "Why do you always wanna get your hair cut off?"  You know, 'cause we got our--we used to have our--real short haircut called the hustler--it was barely a fuzz, and shaped up all the way around.  I mean soon as our hair got to be long enough to really notice, we wanted it off because it was nappy, and Daud would say, "Well, why are you ashamed of your hair?  I'll cut it if you want me to but--but that's, that's your crown, that's the hair that you were born with."  He said that, "Your African ancestors have had that hair for years, and if people from Ireland are proud of their hair, and people from Italy are proud of their hair, why should people from Africa be ashamed of theirs; that's your nat"--and we would sit there and say, "What is this guy talkin' about?"  But it was, it was so good to have a different perspective, and that's when we started to get involved with the Civil Rights Movement and listening to what was going on with great attention to all of the detail because of Daud.
Story_ID: 67407
Speaker 1: So I remember one--I was, I was taking a course at St. Joseph's [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and the course was rational psychology and we had this many-degree Jesuit teaching the course, and this guy was so arrogant that he thought that you didn't have to take a test to learn in his classroom; all you had to do was to be exposed to him.  It was a five-credit course.  Every single day we had that course, and all you had to do was be exposed to him, and through osmosis you would learn enough to have an A as long as you didn't miss any classes.  If you missed two classes you got a B, if you missed four you got a C, and so on; no quizzes, no test--just be exposed to me.  You also couldn't ask any questions, you also couldn't disagree with him because he knew everything, and so one day he was in there talking about the greatest period in the history of man as to the pursuit of education and knowledge, and he said that that was during the period--the Golden age of Greece--Socrates, Plato, Aristotle; and he said that there was no time in history where man was more fond of, of gaining knowledge and, and that was the center of all knowledge on the face of the earth.  And I raised my hand and I said, "You know, I don't know; people will seem to be doing pretty well now; somebody just invented a polio vaccine that--and people are sending satellites up; I mean what are you talking about?  I mean these guys were all right, but I mean they must have gotten their information from somebody, I mean"--he said, "Sit down; you don't know what you're talkin' about."  So I, I was really upset and I went to get a haircut that day, and Daud was cutting my hair and he said, "Well, Bruce, what's wrong?  You seem like there's something wrong."  And I told him about this experience and he gave me a book.  He went in the back, you know, and, and pulled out a book called The Stolen Legacy, and that book talked about why Socrates showed up mysteriously at the age of forty already with information and knowledge intact, and, and how the information that he had was so foreign to the people in Greece that they made him take hemlock, and detailed how he had actually been in Northern Africa and learning from the priest in Egypt and that's where he got most of his information.  So I took this book back to school and--and I, and I, and I gave it to the professor after the class the next day and he said, "What is this?"  And I said, "Well, you know, I read it maybe you should read it and we can discuss it."  And he came in two days later and said, "We're not gonna have a normal class; we're gonna devote the whole class to this book that Mr. Crawley bought in; it's honestly nonsense.  The publisher says that the Egyptians were a race of black and brown people, and we know how ridiculous that is."  And everybody started laughing; I was the only black person in the class.  He went through and he eviscerated this book, he, he destroyed the publisher, he talked about everything in it and said it was all lies, and at the end of the class, he said, "And that's it."  And I said, "Well, you know, if that's true, if Greece was the center of all knowledge, why did they make Socrates take hemlock?  Why did they send Aristotle into exile?  Explain that to me--if they wanted knowledge and information so much and nobody else in Greece had this information, and yet they had that information in Northern Africa.  And he said, "Class dismissed."  And he gave me a C for the five-credit course, and I never saw him again; he went off to Europe to learn, again, some more misinformation.  But, but Daud was very important to all of us. I mean we, we would go to the barber to get information about our heritage.  And I just saw him at the Richard Allen Reunion Picnic a month ago; he's had a great impact on all of our lives.
Story_ID: 67408
Speaker 1: What's ironic is that, you know, Richard Allen himself even, you know, tried to find that kind of information--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Richard Allen and Martin Delany and other people--Prince Hall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--You know, the amazing thing to me is, as a young man, when I finally found out that there was a real person name Richard Allen and there was a real person name Absalom Jones, I was so shocked because I thought that Richard Allen was simply the name of a housing project; I had no--they never taught us that in Catholic grade school nor in St. Joseph's Preparatory School.  There was no way that I could know who Richard Allen was, and, and--you know, and I realized that Mother Bethel Church was right here in Philadelphia and it was an eye-opening experience.  But it, but it--again, it tells you that, that as an African American, you have to supplement your education; you have to do continuous reading, and I tried to impress that on my son, and he's--he has done that and he still does, and my brothers all do the same but--and my sisters--they all do the same, and it is, it is vitally important because all of the story is not gonna be presented to you--unfortunately; and I think that over time we can get closer to that.  I hear that the governor of New Jersey, [James] McGreevey, is just moving some, some bills through the Jersey legislature that will make it mandatory that all of the schools teach African American history and incorporate that, not as a sidebar to the education, but as a primary component of the education, and so I think over time that will change, but--when we had to learn on the margins, unfortunately, and some people didn't get the opportunity.
Speaker 1: It's such a struggle--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean that was going in the 19--well, from the 19--early 1900s all the way through the '60's [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm (ph.).
Speaker 1: --when Bill Cosby, a Philadelphia [Pennsylvania--you know, produced a special about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Who, who, who lived in Richard Allen projects; did you know that?
Speaker 1: No, I did not.
Speaker 2: He, he moved out as a young man, but he, he grew up in Richard Allen projects.
Speaker 1: A lot of--there've been a lot of great book collectors out of Philadelphia, and people are teaching this--you know, trying to teach black history and culture for years, and it's been a struggle for a long, long time (unclear).
Speaker 2: It's taught, unfortunately, as a diversion or as something that's not critically important to education, but--we just had a big issue here in Philadelphia about the discovery that when George Washington lived here, there were slaves that he kept at his residence at Sixth and Market, and when they talked about building a new Liberty Bell Pavilion and having a monument to George Washington, there was great outcry from the community because some historian found out specifically about the existence of those slaves and the community came together and insisted that there be an appropriate exhibition--an appropriate remembrance of what those people did, what they contributed, who they were--not just the fact that they were seven slaves but, but who they were as people and what they contributed to George Washington and to the history of the United States.  So that's gonna happen, and Congressman Chaka Fattah got $10 million appropriated through the Appropriations Committee and the Congress, so that--again, things that we never knew, that we never even thought about, were deprived of, and it caused us not to be as proud of we should have been about who we were and, hopefully, our kids won't have to go through that.

Speaker 1: Now, you met your first wife in--was it in college, or--
Speaker 2: I met her originally in college, but we never really spent any time together in college; she was an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] and I was a Kappa [Alpha Psi], but I was--she was at Cheyney [University], an all-black campus, and I was at St. Joseph's [University], an all-white campus, and I would go back and forth to Cheyney whenever I possibly could.  And so I met her there but we never had a relationship; and then, years later, a friend of mine who had an advertising agency here in town, George Beech [ph.], African American agency owner, introduced me to her and I said, "I know you; I remember you from school."  And we eventually got married and, and had my son Christopher.
Speaker 1: As we said earlier, you know, you've made a point to have a strong relationship with your son, you know, in spite of the fact that the marriage, you know--
Speaker 2: Didn't work out.
Speaker 1: --didn't work out; I understand.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Story_ID: 67410
Speaker 1: How did you get the idea of starting your own business?  A lot of people are satisfied with being an executive in a major corporation; they think they have it made and everything.  How did you get that idea?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I really got a little tired of working for new managers, none of whom knew anything about corporate communications, none of whom had degrees in journalism or marketing or advertising, but who had the responsibility of doing my annual performance review, and I thought that was kinda silly.  And, and, and I also got a little put off by, by their insecurity.  I remember when I was a vice president, and the person I worked for was an executive vice president with senior vice president between us, he gave me fair reviews; but then when I became a senior vice president and there was no level of management, I was the next step below him, he started to give me reviews that said, "Well, he's just a fair performer."  And I said, "You know, I've never been a fair performer; you go back over my twenty years at this bank, look at all my reviews.  Why did I start to become a fair performer now that I'm one step behind you?  I don't want your job; I don't wanna do what you do."  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Machiavelli (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, yeah; you know--and it, it became obvious that it was time to go, and I was not a good soldier once I realized what his motivation was.  So I got a guy who used to work with me, Mike Haskins and said to Mike and, and a woman who was in the Public Relations Society with me--I didn't know her very well but she did a lot of non-profit PR, and I called the two of them together and said, "Let's start a business; I'm ready to get outta here."  And so Mike and I and her, we started meeting after work and on weekends for about four months; we put together a business plan, pooled our capital--didn't take very much capital--rented a space over in the, in the Bourse Building a couple blocks from here.  And I remember when we signed a lease and the lease became effective on May 19th, and so it was time for us to resign and we had everything in place, and I called Mike and I said--Mike was now working upstairs for another manager.  I said, "Mike, you know it's time for us to resign because the clock is ticking, and as of May 19th, we're paying rent at this new place."  I said, "So we'll both resign today at 4:00 and then, you know, we'll talk about it later."  And Mike said, "Okay, I'll resign to my guy and you resign to yours."  And so he went off to do his thing and I called the guy I was working for.  At this time, I was reporting to the vice chairman of the board, and I called him and he was out and his secretary said, "He won't be back today."  And I said, "When is he getting back?"  She said, "Well, he'll be in in the morning."  I said, "Well, put me on the first thing in the morning with him."  Said, "What's the subject?"  "I can't tell you what the subject is; put me on with him first thing in the morning."  She said, "Okay, Bruce, I'll put you on."  So I hang up the phone and so then Mike calls me about 4:20, says, "I did it" "What did you do?" He said, "I resigned; how did you do?"  I said, "I didn't get a chance to talk to him."  And it was a dead silence on the other end of the phone. He thought I didn't have the nerve to quit and, and, you know, I could imagine that he was a little distraught and I explained it to him.  The first thing the next day, I went in and I resigned too, but we just, we just had--had enough; it was time to move, it was time to, to see whether we could do what we told everybody was so easy to do.  And, and most African Americans that you talk to in corporate America, in corporate life, will say, "In order to be competitive, we have to be twice as good as our white peers," and I said to Mike, "Well, we're twice as good, we shouldn't have a problem unless maybe we're not, and we'll find that out; we'll find out if we're twice as good."  And so with that philosophy we, we decided to step away and never looked back.
Story_ID: 67411
Speaker 1: I think, I think one of the best things for me--my son was seven or eight at the time, and when we would drive around the city, he would look out the windows of the car and he knew the logo of the bank; he would say, "Daddy's bank," you know, "First Pennsylvania, First Pennsylvania."  And he was very proud of that.  And right after we set up our new office--we had a logo sign on the wall with Crawley, Haskins and Rodgers, and Chris saw the sign--he was about eight years old, and I was talking to him later on 'cause he would always talk about wanting to grow up and work at a bank.  And he said, "Well, Dad, you know, when I grow up and start the Christopher Crawley Company then"--I said, "Wow," you know.  It was all that he knew; he said he saw his father start a business and name it after himself; I guess that's what you do.  And that was the most rewarding aspect of starting a business; that it freed him to think about entrepreneurship as if it was a perfectly normal thing to do.  But no, we've never looked back.  I was worried about paying that tuition at that private school, but--but we never looked back.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How has Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] been for you as a place to start up a business?  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.  You know, I think that--it, it was the best place for me to start a business because I had spent a lot of time in corporate Philadelphia and I knew a lot of the principal decision-makers, had served on boards, I had done a lot of volunteer work and always been involved in civic activities, community activities, and, and our first marketing plan consisted of us coming up with a list of companies that we thought needed the services of a PR firm, but also winnowing that list down to places where we knew a principal decision-maker.  So, even though there were some companies--some large companies that could probably have used our service, we knew that it wasn't an easy decision for somebody to leave a firm that they already had, so we thought we'd be able to get a shot with companies that were managed or headed, or whose PR function was headed by somebody that I had a relationship with.  So that's how we made up our primary list; it wouldn't have been quite so easy in New York [New York] or Chicago [Illinois] and some of the other places.  We had a built-in advantage here and we knew that, and we used that to put together our prospect list, and all we wanted to do was get in the door, have a meaningful conversation, and get a project.  And we thought that over time, we could convert a project into a retainer.  But I think, you know, having invested all those years and all of that work, it wasn't that difficult; it was a pretty straight line kind of a process; I mean it was, it was what you would recommend to somebody who wanted to start a business, and it worked because of the relationships; if you don't have those relationships, I think it's very difficult.  There are people who are in the PR business and the advertising business who only know other PR and advertising professionals; they go to all those professional association meetings and they, they have great peer relationships, but they never establish relationships with CEOs and line department heads and, and people who have budgetary responsibility beyond staff and, you know, I've worked in a--you know, I was, I was always involved with, with non-profit organizations and seated next to CEOs and people who, who, who are primary decision-makers and they knew me from that, and so I was able to get the entree.  So I think, I think Philadelphia in that regard was a, was a, was a, was the perfect place for me to start my business and maybe I could have gone to LA and over time had success, but this was the easy straight line way because the relationships were there  03:20:22:22 And we, we, we opted not to focus on small businesses as prospects; we didn't wanna be in a tussle with people for their receivables, you know. Small businesses have challenges, and we didn't want to be a small business working with other small businesses, so we focused on large corporate entities and, and, and to the extent that we wanted to do work in the community, we picked a number of non-profit groups for which we did pro bono work; we didn't wanna work with these small non-profits and charge them because we didn't wanna be in a position where we had to send the collector out after some non-profit group that we wanted to help.  So every year we select some non-profits--events the Richard Allen Picnic and the Odunde African Festival, and we never charge them a dime but, you know, they need the support, they need the communications assistance.  So, you know, with what we are able to generate from large corporate work, we are able to do that kind of work.  And I guess the big issue for us--you know, Philadelphia is not an ideal place for black businesses.  We had a, we had a, a, a fair experience, I think, but in the main--contracts are hard to come by.
Story_ID: 67412
Speaker 1: Large corporate entities do business with African American consultants, lawyers, marketing firms, communications firms, primarily when they're in trouble in the African American community; if they have a crisis they call us, if things are running smoothly they don't even think about using us--not even when it's, when it's in their best interest to do so from a marketing perspective; they don't proactively seek us out, so when they have a, when they have a problem they come to us.  So realizing that, we wanted to start, my partner and I talked about starting an African American Chamber of Commerce here in Philadelphia at some point but, you know, the first three or four years was a little tough 'cause we were tryin' to generate our own cash flow, but after we got that up and running in, in '83 [1983]--in '93 [1993], we got together with a number, about thirty, of the black businesses and pulled 'em in, did a presentation and said, "You know, we oughta have an African American Chamber here," and that's been running--I've been chairman of that organization since its inception; probably time for me to move on, but it's a, it's a good group and, and it's directed at, at your question, how is it--you know, how easy, how comfortable is it, generally speaking, for African Americans to start a business?  It's damn difficult, it's very tough; our contracts are hard to come by both in the public sector and the private sector, and we're constantly fighting that battle, not just for ourselves but, but through the organization for, for the member groups.
Speaker 2: What kinds of things do you all do as an organization to make things better?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, one of the things that we do is have what we call a Business Opportunity Breakfast, and we'll bring in corporate procurement officers who claim they want to do business with diverse service providers but they just don't know where to find them, so we, we, we invite 125 people in and we bring the, the chief procurement officer in and we say, "Talk to them about what you want to buy.  And then after the meeting, you guys sit down and talk about how we're going to work together to establish opportunities for them to have one-on-one conversations with other people in your department so they can really identify the work that ought to be done."  So we do that as a standard thing we do.  One of the things that we're working on now is to put together a loan pool; as a matter of fact, when I leave here I have to talk to one of the lending officers at Citizens Bank, a guy by the name of Chris Talizzi [ph.], who happens to have worked at First Pennsylvania Bank when I was there, and now he's an executive vice president at this Citizens Bank, this, this monster institution; but we, we wanted to--because African American businesses, contractors primarily, have a difficult time getting lines of credit even when they're secured lines; they have a difficult time getting advances on their receivables so they can't pay their people even though the work has been done and somebody owes them money, they--so, so we did a survey of the members of the Chamber and found that sixty-five percent of 'em thought that the number one banking service they needed was a line of credit, they just didn't have it; so we pulled together the eight largest banks in the city--at the Chamber, had the mayor sit in on the meeting 'cause we've been working with the mayor since he was president of city council.  So we, we had him sit in on a meeting, had the finance director of the city sitting there--the eight largest banks and the one African American commercial bank in town.  And we talked about the concept of having a loan pool.  We hope that will be a minimum $20 million that will be accessible for secured lines of credit.  The, the ultimate objective is to have relationships between the, the, the black business owner and the bank, but in the short-term, the objective is to ensure that they can get advances on their receivables for cash flow purposes or working capital purposes.  I talked to the, the bankers on Friday; they left an email--they left a voicemail for me saying that they've finished the first draft--'cause we've gone through a number of meetings and now there's a draft on the working document; that'll be done, and we hope before the end of September, there'll be an announcement where the mayor will attend and all the banks will stand there and we'll kick this thing off.  You know, African Americans will participate certainly, but--and Hispanics, Asians, women's businesses will also be able to access this in a way that they haven't been able to access working capital needs before so--the kinda thing that the Chamber does.
Story_ID: 67413
Speaker 1: We've been very active in trying to get people involved with, with contracts to the new stadiums; the, the, the, the Eagles and the Phillies are both building stadiums and ballparks, respectively, and the Phillies have agreed to allocate $100 million for minority contractor participation, and we've been very aggressive in ensuring that that actually occurs. We got the commitment, now we wanna make sure it actually happens.  But we're also fighting Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, the SEPTA, the mass transit agency in town, because they just did a contract in West Philadelphia, a predominantly black community, and in that community they let a $41 million contract, and of that $41 million, less than one percent was allocated to African American businesses; that's unacceptable--wholly, totally unacceptable.  And they tell us it's politics, they tell us it's a Republican-dominated board; we don't care what the reason is, it's unacceptable.  And so on September the 16th, the Chamber [African American Chamber of Congress] will have its third meeting with the mayor and the board and general manager of SEPTA, to ensure that nothing like that ever happens again.  You know, you know, Malcolm [X] used to say, "You cut off my legs and criticize me for not being able to walk," and how do you expect African Americans to participate in the economy when this kind of economic discrimination and segregation is still going on?  It's unacceptable, can't happen.  And until people are able to do that, they can't maintain their neighborhoods, they can't create employment, so this is all vitally important, and the Chamber tries to play a role in all of that.  We also do a Buy Black program every year, Christmas time especially--Christmas-Kwanzaa; we've done that since right after the Million Man March.  We came back from the Million Man March with a new commitment to do that, you know; we find that African Americans spend about $15 billion a year in the Greater Philadelphia area and, regrettably, 93 cents out of every one of those dollars is spent in a business that's not owned by African Americans.  So we, we, we, we don't want them to discriminate against white businesses, Korean businesses, but we went them to start to spend at least 50 percent of their money with African Americans so that they can contribute to the community, they can fix up their house, they can buy a nice car, you know, and send their kids to a good school, and as long as we don't understand that part of the equation, we will always live in, in rundown neighborhoods and ghettos, and be marginalized in this society.  So it begins with that, and we try to tell people that every purchase decision they make is an economic decision, you know.  It makes a difference where you buy their grape soda and that bag of potato chips; you might not think it's important but it's an economic decision that you're making.  So, yeah, that's what the Chamber does, and it's, it's very time-consuming but it's, it's, it's fun.
Speaker 2: You know it sounds like very important work.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is, it is, it really is.
Story_ID: 67414
Speaker 1: Okay.  What have been some of the challenges and triumphs of running your own business here?
Speaker 2: I, I guess the thing that makes us most proud about this business is that we can impact issues that probably couldn't have been impacted unless there was an African American PR firm and ad agency in town, and one of the most obvious examples of that was the work we did with United Bank of Philadelphia.  About a year and a-half after we opened the firm, we were approached by the people who were trying to form United Bank of Philadelphia, and it was to be the first African American commercial bank in the city since 1956; we've had thrift institutions but no commercial bank in Philadelphia, and there had been seven or eight aborted attempts to start a commercial bank in Philly.  I remember when I was working at First Pennsylvania Bank; I sat and watched all that take place.  And these people approached us and said, "Look, we've been at this for a year and a-half, we can't get it right, we can't get the kind of support we need from the large corporate community, we're not getting support from the African American community.  Can you put together a communications plan to help us get this bank funded?  And by the way, our largest investor is about to leave next week."  And we said, "Okay."  And so we sat down with them and we were very comfortable in that arena because I had been in the banking business for twenty years and I knew the founding president, a woman named Emma Chappell, and I knew, I knew her from my days as part of the Urban Bankers Association.  So we began to put together a marketing plan for that--and a communications plan to form United Bank; they needed $5 million in capital; they had about $200,000 in capital, and the state said if they don't raise $5 million, the deal is done, it's over, pack your bags and go home.  And then one of the first people that I reached out to was a guy who was a former president of First Pennsylvania Bank, a patrician white man, who is--who I felt was always ultimately fair, his name was James Bodine and I called him up and I said, "Jim, they're about to lose their biggest investor; he's about to take his money back and we don't want this to be public until they have somebody to replace that money, and could you lend your name at least?  You don't have to make an investment but, you know, we need somebody who has great credibility in the banking community 'cause we're goin' after the banking community to ask them to make investments and we need to show that there's some credible banking experience in the mix."  And Jim said, "Well, yeah, sure."  He had retired from First Pennsylvania [Bank], he'd, he'd become the secretary of state for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and was doing some other things in the civic arena.  But he said, "Oh, sure, I'd be glad to do it."  And I put him together with Emma and not only did he agree to go on their board, but he put in $100,000 of his own money.
Story_ID: 67415
Speaker 1: And then we put together this plan--put together a communications plan that involved bringing down other African American bank CEOs because this city had not seen an African American commercial bank president since 1956, so everybody who would have been familiar with that concept was gone.  And so when we said--when they said, "We're gonna start a bank and we're gonna have a black president," people said, "This is impossible;" even black people said it was impossible.  So I invited down Bernard West who had been the president of a bank in Boston; he originally lived in Philly but he was president of a bank up in Boston called the Coolidge Bank.  I invited down a guy named George Russell who was president of Freedom National Bank, and invited Homer, who was the president of Commerce Bank in Boston--Ron Homer and, and sat Emma [Chappell] on the same podium with them, and so I had 'em all give presentations, and invited media and invited community leaders and, and then we had separate meetings with potential investor groups with that same panel so that people could get a comfort level, and then we did--we changed the name from the United People's Bank to United Bank of Philadelphia; we thought United People's Bank sounded like a movement rather than a bank.  And so we began to do the kinds of things that were necessary, and they raised $6 million, and the bank was opened.  We had Patty LaBelle doing public service announcements--they were great.  And we had Calvin Butts come down one night from Abyssinian Baptist to do a--an investment seminar.  We were--we were trying to convince black folks to invest in a bank where they had never invested in anything, so, so we had him as the draw to talk about the concept and the need for an African American bank, and then we had investment professionals where people went into their breakout sessions to talk about all the kinds of investment vehicles that, that could be available to them, and the advantage to them of investing, and the advantage to the community in ownership, and then we got the churches involved. We had, we had two Black Bank Sundays in the church, and we asked the minister, "If you pass the plate three times, do it four times now; on the fourth time, let that be the capital that your church puts into the bank."  And, and it worked, and we're very proud of that.  I mean we don't think that that would have happened if our firm wasn't in existence.
Story_ID: 67416
Speaker 1: We also are very pleased with the work we were able to do with, with the guy who is now the mayor but at the time, he was a president--he was a district councilman, and he had been targeted by some of his colleagues and by Bill Gray, and been targeted because they were afraid that if he got re-elected in the next cycle, he might run for president of council, and the guy who was running for mayor, Ed Rendell, did not like him, thought he was too outspoken, and so Rendell and Gray got together, put some funds together, found a candidate, and decided that they were gonna run John Street out of his district council seat.  And I called him up and said, "You know, can we be helpful?  I mean I don't know you that well but, you know, you look like you can stand some help."  And he said, "Yeah, I'll come by the office."  And we sat down and we talked, and we began to work virtually pro bono for him.  When there was stuff that had to be done, of a political nature, he had to pay us, but when he became elected, we did a lot of pro bono government consultancy for him because I didn't wanna be tied to working for him every day.  But he, he decided not to even have a communications department while he was president of city--he became--he won the seat, became president of city council; he ran that campaign and all the communications for that campaign in '91 [1991]; he ran again in '95 [1995], and then when he was re-elected in '95 [1995], we said, "Now, let's start to get positioned for the mayor's seat."  And he resigned three years into his second term as president of the council, announced for mayor, we did--we got a, a pollster in, in October of '97 [1997] to do his first city-wide poll and found out that he was electable city-wide, and we brought in--what's that guy's name?  It's on the tip of my tongue--from Chicago--David--
Speaker 2: Axelrod?
Speaker 1: Axelrod--we brought Axelrod in to help us out 'cause Axelrod has won a lot of mayor's races, and so we had Axelrod, and we had Ron Lester in to do the polling.  Lester was doing work for a good friend of mine in Atlanta [Georgia], bow legs, Marvin Arrington, and when Marvin was running against his opponent in, in Atlanta and I, and I called Marvin and I said, "Look, I got a guy who wants to run for mayor in Philadelphia; who's doing your numbers?"  And he said, "A guy name Ron Lester."  I said, "Well, gimme his name."  And I called Lester and Lester came up, and Lester has been doing polling for Street ever since.  But we think that, that we played some role in all of that and--and again, I mean, had it not been for my ability to have my own business.  I wouldn't have been able to do this if I was still workin' for First Pennsylvania Corporation; I'd be able to volunteer, be on the finance committee but, but the kind of work we were able to do was, was wholly dependent on having your own business, your own operation.  And so it's been, it's been very rewarding (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--There's a political aspect of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--very satisfying.
Speaker 2: --business ownership that people don't--a lot of people are not really fully aware of.
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely important.
Story_ID: 67417
Speaker 1: Now, I know plenty of people who've been fired for their political activities--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, sure.  And yet business owners, owners of large professional corporations in Philadelphia--law firms, engineers, architects, contracting firms--people who benefit by city contracts, are, and have been, forever, large supporters of the political process and, and as we start our own businesses, we need to be there, too; if not, we, we deserve everything that happens to us.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there seems to be a tendency among certain established black businesses to support the status quo--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --hoping that the system will leave 'em alone.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that's sad; and the system does.  And, and some people are, are perfectly happy and successful doing that; I don't know how they sleep at night but, but, but, but they're economically viable and, and, and they have some success.  But I think that, I think that, that politics and the direction of your city, the direction of your state, is something that you ought to impact.  If, if you live in the city and if you live in the state, if you live in the country, you ought to have some input, and not just take somebody else's agenda because somebody else's agenda is never gonna serve you fully, and unless you're a part of structuring the platform, chances are you're gonna be left on the margin and, and if you're happy with being on the margin, if, if money is sufficient, that's, that's okay, but I, I couldn't live like that; I couldn't, I couldn't be that way.  And, and fortunately, through the African American Chamber of Commerce we, we started to see a whole generation of, of new businesses who also feel the same way.  Large white businesses have never stayed away from political process; this country was formed by business owners, and the structure of this government was, was put together by business owners, you know.  The, the, the congressional representative has to run every two years, the senator has a much longer term; he, he tends more often to be a millionaire and a business person, or at least a high-ranking professional, and tends more to be the millionaire; they, they stay in office longer than the president. I mean all of this was struc--and, and we have things called PACs--it's Political Action Committees--are designed for businesses to play a meaningful and, and directive role in, in, in the nature of our political process.  And if, and if it wasn't designed to do that, we wouldn't have Political Action Committees.  And so to tell businesses--fledgling businesses, aspiring businesses--that they shouldn't be involved in the process, I think they're being derelict in their responsibility to their children.  This is the way this country runs; businesses make contributions which dictate platforms, which allow people to buy media, and allow people to be elected--that's the way it works.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Story_ID: 67418
Speaker 1: Is there a national network of black ad agencies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, there, there is; and as a matter of fact, we're gonna be meeting in Washington, D.C. in the next couple of weeks.  There's an organization called the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the 4A's, and there are about--I guess they're an estimated 20 to 25,000 ad agencies in the country; about 700 of 'em are member of 4A's.  In order to join 4A's, you have to submit your work to a panel; you have to submit your financials to a panel, you have to get peer acceptance, and if there are 4A's representative firms in your market area, they ask them to give an opinion of the quality of work that your firm does so that they won't let people in who simply can afford to pay the dues.  So there are about twelve or thirteen African American firms in the country that are members of 4A's, and we have an African American committee of the 4A's and we'll, we'll be meeting in a couple of weeks in Washington [D.C.] to discuss the challenge of, of growing our firms, the challenge of, of, of penetrating government contracts.  It's no secret that, that the federal government does less than three percent of its advertising through African American agencies--nowhere near commensurate with the, the population.  And, again, I mean we're shut out of the economic access and expect it to be able to feed people, employ people, and pay taxes, so--so, that's, that's gonna be one of the major agenda items when we go down to Washington [D.C.].  But, but we, we keep this network among us; we talk to each other all the time, and they're good people.  They're, they're competitors, but they're good people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 67419
Speaker 1: Now, what's the biggest thing that you're working on right now, and what do you project yourself doing in the future, I mean, in terms of growth?
Speaker 2: The biggest thing from a business perspective?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that you're working on (unclear).
Speaker 2: The biggest contract.
Speaker 1: Well, the most important one, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I, I guess the biggest has been, for years, two relationships--one with Keystone Mercy Health Plan which is a, a, a component of Independence Blue Cross, then we've got a, a really strong relationship with Marriott at the national level and we, we do crisis communications and advertising, and we started off doing work with their franchise development group that's very important because of the name prestige of the company and the work that we're able to do; it's very important to us.  But we just landed a participation in a, in a state contract which is a three-year contract, and a substantial one, with the Health Department, and it will have implications for addressing the issue of tobacco usage in the state, and other kinds of health problems state-wide.  There was a time when we came out of the banking business that we wanted to focus solely on the private sector 'cause we thought the private sector was where the stable revenues were, and government was shaky.  Nowadays, the most unstable revenue sources are private corporations.  Imagine small businesses that had the receivables sitting on their desk from Enron and WorldCom and, you know, those guys are hurting, and, and, and management turnover is such that if you form a relationship and, and, and in a communications business you want a high-placed relationship; you form a relationship and the CEO is gone in six months to a year.  It's a very unstable environment; it's more stable now--I never thought I'd be able to say this; government work is more stable, and so that was a real shift for me to, to, to focus on government work.  Even all the time when we were working with the president of city council and over the past two and a-half years we were working with the mayor, we never really sought out very many city contracts because our preference was the private sector; but the, the state contract is gonna be important, and we would like to land some federal-level contracts because, again, they're more projectable, they're more secure, and you don't have the scandal right now that you have in the private sector, so--I never thought I'd say that but that's where we are.
Story_ID: 67420
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many people do you employ right now, and how big an operation (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We've got fourteen people right now, and they include all self-contained work; we, we, we go out to produce TV spots because we don't keep an, an internal production capability but, but graphics and, and writing and, and all strategic planning--everything else happens inside the shop, and we're very proud of what we do here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you all are rated as the 20th largest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, well, we've been, over the past three years, 18th and 19th and 20th largest; last year, we were not on the list, and the problem is that African American agencies aren't always African American agencies anymore.  There's been a chal--and then one of the things that we're gonna discuss clearly, when we get down to Washington [D.C.], is this whole incursion into the African American agency business by the large corporate players.  For years, they denied the existence of an African American market and the need to communicate separately to that audience, but then the market grew to 600 billions (ph.) of dollars, and clients started to say, "Well, we need to make sure we're tapping that market appropriately."  It's no longer enough to say, "Well, they read the Wall Street Journal, they read the New York Times, and they read the mainstream papers and watch TV, so we're getting them anyway."  They, they started to recognize that there is some specific expertise that must be brought to bear if you're gonna really maximize your return on those, on those markets.  So what they've begun to do over the past several years is to buy the largest African American ad agencies and create new ones with their capital.  So the, the, the firm that is now the 20th largest is billing fourteen millions of dollars; they didn't exist a year and a-half ago, but they're a part of Omnicom which is one of the three large--there are three large global advertising agency ownership groups--Omnicom, PPG and, and Interpublic Group--WPP and Interpublic Group, and they are all now buying; they, they bought Burrell, they bought Don Coleman, they bought UniWorld.  Spike Lee is Spike DDB, which is Doyle Dane Bernbach, which is part of the Omnicom Group.  So if you look at that list, there are precious few that are still African American-owned, so their capital is not self-generated; they didn't--and, and they, they don't have to pitch accounts the way we do.  We still have to go out as an African American firm and convince somebody on the other side of the desk that we are capable and qualified to do the work; they'll get a major account and break off a piece and give it to their African American department.  So that list is no longer the list of African American-owned agencies.
Speaker 1: If you look at Burrell, for example--Tom Burrell (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--And Burrell used to be the largest in the United States, right?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Used to be--but he, he, he did a, a, a strategic relationship with Publicis, which is a France-based advertising agency PR firm; and, and people were excited because Publicis did not take fifty-one percent, they took 49 percent of Burrell; so the assumption was that Tom Burrell had 51--no, he has forty-three; somebody else has eight, so Publicis doesn't have fifty-one, but they have the controlling interest, and that's what we're up against more and more, and so that we're starting to have a, a, a class system, a tiering system, inside the advertising agency business.  Those people who first denied that the, that the African American market was important and that it existed now have bought it; and they're doing the same thing with Hispanic agencies.  And so they wanna be self-contained so that, so that their clients never come to them and say, "Well, I wanna take a piece of this work and give it to this minority firm."  You don't have to do that anymore, we have it in-house; and that's what's happened to UniWorld.  In fact, they just changed the name of Don Coleman to GlobalHue, H-U-E, GlobalHue; so if Don Coleman decides to leave, they don't even have the embarrassment of, of the name partner leaving.  So it's, it's a very sad day for African American agency business.  We thought that, that when everybody fully understood the potential of the market, it would be a golden day.  They understand the potential of the market and they bought it.  So, yeah, we, we were, we were listed among the top twenty over those years; I don't know where we are now, I guess we're twentyone, I'm, I'm not sure.  But this, this group that moved us out is a part of Omnicom.  We, we did this with our own capital.  We--all of the, all of the equity that went into this, and is still in this, is the equity of the three partners.
Story_ID: 67421
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any other concerns you wanna share with us about the ad business here?
Speaker 2: Not especially; I, I think that the advertising agency business and, and, and the PR business though, for African Americans is, is extremely difficult because there is an inherent assumption that we don't understand the King's English, that we can't write, that we can't communicate, and so they're, they're gonna get an inferior product from us.  That's a, a faulty assumption, but it's somethin' that's a part of the society that we live in; so there's a special challenge for African American PR firms, special challenge for people who are writing copy in African American ad agencies.  It's a very difficult thing; they, they don't believe that, that we can deliver, and so we take great pride in being able to deliver for our clients in, in that regard. We don't think the competition is that stiff; we think the competition is better capitalized.  They have better connections, they have more access, but when it comes down to delivering a product of service, we think that we hang right in there with 'em.
Story_ID: 67422
Speaker 1: Sir, now, we've--you've talked all, you know, throughout this discussion, about your hopes and concerns for the black community but I always ask this question anyway.  What are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: My primary hope for the black community is that we become aware of the importance of, of economic integration; we, we, we have not really fully absorbed that concept and, and, and when we fully absorb that concept, we will then understand how important it is to focus our expenditures, $600 billion a year, and just like the problem we have in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], getting people to focus on a buy black campaign, not because we wanna discriminate with--against anybody else, but that we wanna keep some of that capital inside our community long enough for us to benefit by it.  And when we don't benefit by our own capital, we put ourself at a, at an ongoing disadvantage, and I would hope that over time, we begin to see the value of that.  I, I was very disappointed one year--about four or five years ago, I was out speaking at the Wharton School [of the University of Pennsylvania] to some black students who were seniors at Wharton and I was talkin' to them about this concept, and they said, "Well, Mr. Crawley, we don't understand what you mean.  You mean we should buy a hamburger from a black hamburger stand and walk past a white hamburger stand with a better hamburger, just because a person is black."  I said, "Why did you make the assumption that the white hamburger was better?  --that's your problem."  We, we, we still, at this late date, believe, unfortunately, that white folks' ice is colder and their sugar is sweeter, and until we get past that, we will be at economic disadvantage.  When, when, when we have people who have to get repairs on their home done and they say, "I won't use a black contractor because I had a bad experience with a black contractor one time twenty years ago," we're at a, we're at an economic disadvantage because we're not keeping that money in our own community.  I think that's the, that's the last hurdle for the African American community. We've got people who have graduated from college who have gone to the best business schools on earth and, and even those people, when they come out, don't patronize black businesses, and, and they're fairly oblivious of, of a need to do so while they're working in a large corporate setting.  I, I, think if, if I have any hope, if I have any dream, any ambition for this community, it's that we begin to understand, as other communities do.  I was, I was--I went to a store once, when my son was very young, it's called Boyd's, it's a major men's store in Philadelphia, and my son needed some shoes and, and I was on the street and I was in front of Boyd's and I looked--I walked in the door and said, "Do you carry shoes in his size?"  And they said, "No, we don't."  And I was on 18th and Market and they said--18th and Chestnut--and they said, "We don't have 'em, but my cousin has 'em, and my cousin is two miles away, and I'll show you how to get there."  We need to be like that; we need to keep that money in the family, in the, in the community; we're not there yet.  And as long as they have that advantage over that--over us, we will be at a, a working disadvantage.  We will be at a working disadvantage as, as far as the education of our children is concerned, as far as the, the, the, the content and, and structure of our community is concerned, the quality of the housing is concerned, and the choice of elected officials is concerned.  All of this--it begins in, unfortunately, in America; it begins and ends with your ability to control your economic circumstances.  We've gotten civil rights, but we don't have that vital component, and until we get that--and I think that we've got a shot; I think--I, I see young people coming out in the music industry--we got young kids coming out in the music industry that, that would not think about giving up the rights to their music or, or, or having somebody else produce their songs; that's a far cry from, you know, the doo wop era; and, and even the Berry Gordy era, when people gave up the rights to their music, gave up all rights to that which, which could protect their, their, their livelihood into their old age because they didn't know; they weren't sophisticated, they didn't understand that they had to control not just the creative content, but they had to control the economic component.  Young kids, I think, give me some hope.  These, these hip-hoppers that everybody have so much disdain for--I think these hip-hoppers understand that part of the business better than, than musicians of my era ever did.  So that gives me some hope, and I think that other people can, can also begin to turn that corner.
Story_ID: 67423
Speaker 1: You're still active, you have a lot to do, but looking back on the body of work that you've accumulated so far, what do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't know; I, I, I really don't know.  I, I think that one of the things that I've always wanted to be involved with is, is self-determination efforts in the community.  When I was Chairman of the Board of the Philadelphia Urban League, we started a thing called the Leadership Institute and, and, and the, and the reason we wanted to start that, it--there was a thing in Philadelphia called Leadership, Inc., and all of the, the large white corporate executives would come into town or, or, or be assigned from their upwardly mobile management position into Leadership, Inc., and they would learn about how the city worked and how the state worked and who was making economic and political decisions and, and basically, what they were learning was how to maintain the status quo, and I, I went through that program; the bank put me in that program early on--I was like there for two years, and they put me in the program and I sat around and all these guys were talking about what they were doing to maintain the status quo, and I would raise my hand and say, "Well, how do we relate this back to the black community?"  And they would look at me like I was from Mars.  And I say, "Well, I'm not supposed to ask questions like that?"  And so I always wanted to start something for people who also were upwardly mobile but who wanted to change the status quo.  So when we came into the Urban League's chairmanship, we started something called the Leadership Institute, and we put together a class--I mean they used to have a class every year of fifty people, and one or two would be black.  Well, you know, there are almost 700,000 black people in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]; one or two leaders made each year is not gonna get us there.
Story_ID: 67424
Speaker 1: So we, we started the thing called the Leadership Institute, and with the Leadership Institute, we had fifty people every year--some Hispanic, some Asian, but primarily African American leaders--public sector, private sector.  One of our first class--we had a guy, Michael Nutter, who's now a city councilperson; a second class we had another woman, Blondell Reynolds Brown, who's now a city councilperson; the woman who's now head of the United Way, an African American woman who's head of the United Way in Philadelphia--was in the first class; my partner Mike Haskins was in the first class.  A guy who's a, a state senator, Vincent Hughes, out in West Philadelphia--great man, I have great respect for him; we flunked him outta the first class because he would do his work.  He said he was too important, he had much that he had to do in the general assembly, and he didn't have time to do his assignments, so we flunked him and he didn't graduate with his class.  And he came back, to his credit, and put in the full effort the second time around and graduated.  We did that because whenever the Urban League would go out to do something, anything, there would always be phone calls from people who would say, "You know, it's nice that you're doin' this, but how about these other three things?  Why aren't you doing this and why aren't you doing that?"  And so we said, "Why don't you do it?"  "You don't have to have the logo of the Urban; start your own organization, create your own logo, create your own stationery and fix it."  And so the idea of the Leadership Institute was to do that, and we've graduated about 500 people now, many of whom are very influential, and who are very networked in this city.  We tried to give that concept to the National Urban League; they weren't interested in it, but I think it would be a great national model because we do need to do that.  Leaders can be created, and people simply have to know what buttons to push, you know, who makes the economic decisions, who makes the political decisions, how do you organize, how do you get capital from banks--and they can do it; it's not rocket science.  They just have to be reminded that they can do it, and we think the Leadership Institute does that and, and it puts them out, not only with the tools, but with the network, and a network across generational lines, so people who graduated ten years ago talk to people who graduated this year and, and so it's, it's a good thing, and and, and, and hopefully, that has made some contribution and I'm really proud of having been a part of starting that thing.  It was--ever since I went into Leadership, Inc., I thought that we needed to have something geared to people who wanted to change the status quo.  It does us no good to go through Leadership, Inc. and to come out wanting to keep things the way they are when things the way they are have not been necessarily good for us.  We don't wanna destroy the system, we just want to manipulate it just a bit so that it's workable for us and them, and, and I think people who graduate from the Leadership Institute come out with those tools.
Story_ID: 67425
Speaker 1: That makes sense.  How did your mother feel about your success, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was, she was very proud; my mother was--she was always very happy about that.  I'll tell you a story about my mother.  On my mother's death bed--my mother had three sisters; one passed, two still alive.  Her oldest sister is Catherine.  Catherine lived in New York and was the oldest and was always self-described as the most sophisticated, the most worldly, the most well-traveled; my mother lived in the projects, had six kids--Catherine had no children and Catherine was sharp; she--and she never let anybody forget it.  And there was always this sibling rivalry between my mother and her big sister Catherine.  I love Catherine; she lives here now in the place that mother used to--we bought my mother a condo a few years ago, right before she passed--three years before she passed, and when she passed, we let Catherine move in there; my brother and I own that place.  But I remember--my mother knew she was gonna pass; she was in Jefferson Hospital on her death bed.  She looked at me and said, "You know, when I die, I know you're gonna let Catherine move into my place."  And I said, "Well, yeah, mom, I probably will."  She said, "You don't give her the same deal you gave me."  I said, "We'll make her pay; she has to pay something."  That was my mom.  Even--and she was laughing at the time that she said it, but I think she was really serious, and so we functioned accordingly.  We love our Aunt Catherine, but we can't love her as much as we loved mom; she wouldn't permit it.  So--she was a great woman.
Story_ID: 67426
Speaker 1: And this is the last question.  It's slightly different from the one about legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As somebody who never forgot where he came from, who was fair, and who was not intimidated by anything in this society, who would speak out if, if necessary, to right a wrong, and as somebody who was able to provide for himself and his family.  That's--if, if I could be remembered that way, I'd be absolutely delighted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you, sir; thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Thank you.

Speaker 1: That's a picture of my son Chris and me; we are at my sister's house over the Christmas holidays, and we are a family that takes a lot of photos and, you know--six--I have six members of my family--three brothers, two sisters and me, and we, we are big at photo-taking.  And all of the kids, all the nephews and nieces, are always taking pictures with the parents, and this is a picture of me and my son Chris, who is now twenty-one and in his fourth year at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology].
Speaker 2: This is, I'm sorry, approximately what year?
Speaker 1: This was this past Christmas, 2001--Christmas.
Speaker 2: All right.  Next photo--and describe this photograph for me.
Speaker 1: That's me holding my son Christopher as, as an infant; I was living at the time at--in Center City, Philadelphia, and the family was over to, to visit and to see Chris, and we were having a staring contest, I guess.  I was amazed that I had a son.
Speaker 2: Approximately what year?
Speaker 1: That was approximately 1981.
Speaker 2: Next photo?  And describe this photograph for me.
Speaker 1: That's a photo taken about 1977, '78 [1978]; that is me and my Martial Arts instructor, Teruyuki Okazaki. Master Okazaki is Chairman of the International Shotokan Karate Federation and I studied with him for thirty years in the Martial Arts and, and if I have anybody that I look up to, it is Mr. Okazaki.
Speaker 2: Could you spell his name for us?
Speaker 1: O-K-A-Z-A-K-I, Okazaki.
Speaker 2: His first name?
Speaker 1: Teruyuki, T-E-R-U-Y-U-K-I, Teruyuki Okazaki.
Speaker 2: All right, next photo?
Speaker 1: That's a photo of me, I guess, taken about six, eight years ago, and--when my wife met me, I was dressed that way; I met my wife about six years ago and she told me that I looked like Orville Redenbacher, and so I stopped wearing bow ties.  I used to wear bow ties--I used to wear bow ties everywhere and I thought I was pretty sharp, and she said, "No, you look like Orville Redenbacher," and so I--I still have the bow ties, I just don't wear 'em as much as I used to.
Speaker 2: What year, approximately, was this?
Speaker 1: That was about seven years ago; what's that--in 1995.
Speaker 2: This one--hold on a second.  Okay, describe this photograph?
Speaker 1: That is my grandfather--my, my mother's father.  I never actually met him; he died at a very young age, of tuberculosis; his name was Theodore Roosevelt Crawley.  He was of that age when African Americans were inclined to name their sons after presidents of the United States, and seated on his lap is my oldest aunt, my Aunt Catherine, my mother's oldest sister.  And I, I believe that was in, in West Philadelphia where they lived.
Speaker 2: And you would--happen to know, maybe the approximate year, or his age?
Speaker 1: That, that photo is probably late '20s [1920s], early '30's [1930s]--1929, 1930.
Speaker 2: Okay, next photo?  Please describe this photo.
Speaker 1: That's a photo of me as a five year-old, looks like, with my uncle, Arthur Clifford Welch.  It's my grandmother's brother; my grandmother had two brothers, one I never had the pleasure of meeting--he passed before I was born, but my uncle Arthur, in addition to having a job working for the state liquor store, was also an amateur photographer, and every time we went to Uncle Arthur's house, he would take our pictures and this is one he set with a timer and he ran around and, and posed with me in the photo.
Speaker 2: How old were you, approximately?
Speaker 1: About five years old, looks like.
Speaker 2: Next photo?  And describe this photo?
Speaker 1: This is another photo at Uncle Arthur's house; it's a backdrop that he created in his living room, and that's me in the center, and those are some of my brothers and sisters, and a family friend and a cousin.  To the far left is my brother Mike, who was the youngest of the boys, my sister Terri was an infant at the time; she was not in the photo.  To the right of Mike is Tony George, whose mother and my mother were best friends; their family also lived in Richard Allen Housing Projects.  To the right of Tony is my aunt Sara Marilyn Crawley; to her right is my sister, Patty--Patricia--Patricia Jenkins; to her right is Diane Smith, who was a cousin on my step-father's side.  To Diane's right is my brother Wendell, who's right below in age.  Wendell was frequently distracted and, as my brother Morris, who has his father's name and we called him Boobie (ph.); he's now a psychologist up at East Side High in Patterson, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: And what year, approximately, was your age?
Speaker 1: Ooh, I guess I was about ten, eleven at that time, so it must have been middle '50s [1950s]--'55 [1955], '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: You still call him Boobie?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: He demands to be called Boobie.
Speaker 2: Next photo?  Describe this photograph for me?
Speaker 1: This is me being posed by Uncle Arthur, with shorts and spectators and--I guess, again, I was about five years old at that time.
Speaker 2: That's good lighting.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he, he, he was a--amateur photographer, but he was very serious about it (laughter).  Couldn't get outta the house without having your picture taken.
Speaker 2: Did he develop his own?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Next photograph?  And please describe this photograph?
Speaker 1: This is an official photo; when I started to turn gray, I thought I needed a, a grayer photo; I probably need another grayer--more gray photo now, but that, that's the official photo I've been using for about the past three years.  I guess that picture's about three years old--1999, thereabouts.  You see the bow tie is gone.
Speaker 2: Next photo?  And, describe this photo, please.
Speaker 1: That's my son Chris and I, we are at Clementon Lake Park on an, on an outing; I had just won that big feathered creature on my shoulder for him, and we were on a day-long outing at Clementon Lake Park, which is an amusement park in South Jersey, and he is about, I guess, three or four there; so that must be around '84 [1984], '85 [1985], maybe.
Speaker 2: This photograph, please?
Speaker 1: That is me as an Altar boy; I'm the one with his hands at his tie.  To my left in the photo is Rogers Lucky James, who is one of my best friends in the projects; to my right is David Thompson, who went on to be a member of a musical group called the People's Choice; David used to sit in the back room and play drums with his hands; he became a professional drummer.  And there's Jerome Patterson behind David, and to Lucky's right, within the photo, is a guy name Carl George, and Carl was a friend of my brother Wendell's.  But this summer, Carl's sixteen year-old son was an intern at our firm--Kyle, K-Y-L-E; but--yeah, he called me up one day and said, you know, "Do you have any internships for kids who are still in high school at sixteen?"  I said "Who is it?"  "My son"--great young man.  I mean his son has already been to Ghana for two years, to go to school.  I mean, you know, the experiences that young people get today is amazing.  But we were Altar boys at Our Lady of the Blessed Sacrament.
Speaker 2: Next photo?
Speaker 1: That's me on the right, and those are my three brothers.  We all decided that we were gonna treat ourselves to berets for Christmas (laughter).  That's the favorite beret shot.  To my immediate right is my brother Mike, and my brother Boobie and my brother Wendell.
Speaker 2: Once again, what's Boobie's real name?
Speaker 1: Morris
Speaker 2: And spell that please?
Speaker 1: M-O-R-R-I-S.
Speaker 2: Oh, Morris.
Speaker 1: Morris.
Speaker 2: Next photograph?  And describe this photograph?
Speaker 1: That is a picture of the seventh--no, that's not the seventh, he has a seventh shirt on, but that, that was from a previous year; it's probably the eighth or ninth annual Richard Allen Annual Reunion Picnic out in Fairmount Park, and those are all people who we grew up with in Richard Allen Projects.  To my right here is Brad Henson, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--He's on the far left of the photograph?
Speaker 1: The far left of the photo, and Brad Henson lived upstairs with my friend Wally Henson, and he went into the marines; he's an electrician now.  The guy in the middle is Richard DeBreast (ph.); his, his mother and father had five sons, and, and this is one of the twins--the young twins, and then--

Speaker 1: Ahh.
Speaker 2: Kinda hard to describe everyone in this photo.
Speaker 1: Yeah, won't be--won't be able to do that; those are all kids who are in a special program at the Stoddart Fleisher Junior High School, it's a middle school here in Philadelphia.  And when I lived in public housing, if I had not gone to Catholic school that would have been my middle school.  All of my friends--when I was in the seventh and eighth grade, all of my friends went to that school, and now, friends that I grew up with are teaching at that school and, and are administrators at that school, and they asked me to come back and talk to the kids--it was a special program.  And I came back and they took a photo and we wound up creating a logo for the kids and giving 'em their own shirt, and they formed an organization.  My, my, my partners and art director did a real nice design job for them.

My instructor was Okazaki Sensei; this is Master Nakiyama who was Okazaki Sensei's instructor, and he was in Philadelphia from Japan for a one-week special intensive training course, and we were at Valley Forge Military Academy which the karate organization rented out during the summer because of--for that week during the summer because the place--all the students were gone.  But that--Mr. Nakiyama died about three or four years ago; he was a legend in martial arts.  I was very nervous sitting there.  He was the head of the Supan (ph.) Karate Association in Tokyo.

And we announced the formation of the African American Public Relations Alliance at the NAACP Convention, and this was about three years ago, I guess, '99 [1999]?  And so that's why we had Kweisi Mfume there, and Reverend Al Sharpton; and the other people in the photo are owners of PR firms across the country.  There's a Chicago woman in there--right over my shoulder; she used to work at Burrell, now she has her own--Michelle Flowers.  Yeah, she has her own agency now.  But those are not advertising people, those are PR people.
