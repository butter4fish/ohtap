Speaker 1: [Off-Camera Interruption]
Speaker 2: I want to start by asking about your mother's parents, her mother, her name, and anything you know about her.
Speaker 1: My mother's parent--my mother--I knew my grandmother.  Her name was Trudy Bowers.  And she actually died when I was the age of four.  It was between three and four.  What I remember about my grandmother is she was a, a beautiful woman.  Actually she was part mix.  I'm not sure with what, but she was a tall statute of a woman--and I could have been because I four and looking up--but curly hair.  And she would wear it in this Billie Holliday sort of hairstyle, sort of what we call a pompadour.  She was a very sickly lady.  I remember that.  She, she came to stay with us in Fort Lauderdale [Florida] for my original area of Malone [Florida] because of her illness.  He illness at that time was diabetes.  And because she was not a well lady, she would babysit me when my parents were working.  Actually, she was the first person that I remember sort of gave me an inkling of loving interior designing.  She took this box--it was just a regular crate box--and showed me how to make a bed.  She took a piece of fabric and spread the fabric over the box.  And then she took some stuffing and made the part of the pillow at the top of the bed, and it looked so much like a real bed.  And I was so proud of it until I sat up a playroom into a storage room, a utility room, of the apartment building.  When she found out about it, she was pretty upset because it had electrical danger within this utility room.  My grandmother, as I said, died when I was four.  She died simply because she wasn't correctly diagnosed as being a diabetic.  Part of this was because of the conditions back in those days of being available to go to hospitals where you needed to go.  But I remember being able to see her before she died.  And she was very ill later, but I remember her being very sweet.  My grandfather, Ed Bowers, I'd never met him.  He died when my mother was 14 years old.  And--but what I heard about him was that he was a wonderful man.
Story_ID: 53862
Speaker 1: The legacy of the Bowers' family, which is from my grandfather's side, carry a legacy that many people to this day know about.
Speaker 2: What is that legacy?
Speaker 1: Well, the legacy, we--our, the Bowers' side of--has been having reunions since--family reunions--for 87 years.  So for all of my life I have been hearing about the legacy of these Bowers boys from I think about four generations.  And with the number that there was of the boys from the grandchildren to the grandfathers, it was always that of men of strength, men that loved their families, men that made sure that there--that, that the family knew where they came from.  So I think the legacy has been one to empower us to become better people.
Story_ID: 53863
Speaker 1: Your father's mother, do you--did you know anything or anything stories in regards to her?
Speaker 2: Yes, Grandmother Nita, I--and you know it's--my grand--both grandmothers I knew.  Unfortunately, both grandfathers had passed before I became--was born actually.  But my grandmother would still remained in Malone, Florida until the day she died.  My grandmother on my father's [John Hayes] side actually died the two years after I finished college, so I suppose I was about 21 years old.  I remember her as being like the lady on the pancake box.  She was always a heavy--she was a heavyset lady that wore an apron constantly.  We would--we were raised in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  Now Fort Lauderdale was like night and day of Malone.  And we would cross over that time zone line every summer to go to grandmother's house.  In other words, we would leave from cars and roads being driven, electrical lights, running water into a time zone where it was still candle lights, kerosene lights; there was horse and buggy, and, and cows, and, and vegetables you picked.  It was a lot of fun because I didn't--did not look at it as an inconvenience.  I--it was like going to Disney World when I was a child.  It was so different, and it was so foreign.  I even remember the slot buckets (laughter).  But my grandmother made her own mattresses.  I mean her--she made her mattress.  She'd, she'd, she'd stuff these, these casings with feathers.  And the, the, the truth of it is, is that you would have to stack maybe 10 to 20 to get the height.  So the height for us was at--three, four years old was literally up to our neck.  And it was three of us that will have to draw straws to decide which one would sleep with grandmother for that night.  It was always about come get something to eat to teat (ph.); it wasn't to eat, to teat (laughter).  And I, I learned how to care for animals.  I learned how care for myself by farming.  So I have very fond memories of my grandmother and the old shanty house that gave us a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 53864
Speaker 1: Are there any specific stories that you specially shared with your [paternal] grandmother that you too had a--in your relationship with her?
Speaker 2: I think the thing that I loved about my grandmother, it wasn't a story.  It was just something that she always said that when I would--when I would arrive.  I, I was the chocolate child of the three (laughter), and I had this thick uncontrollable hair.  It was thick and it was, it was--the, the braids would literally protrude away from my face.  You couldn't comb--it wouldn't lie down.  And when I would appear, she said oh, this is just like me.  She looks just like me, my big chocolate baby with all that hair, just as thick as a coal.  And she always related to my appearances as being as hers, which made me very proud because back in the '60's [1960s], or in, in, in, in the '50's [1950s], when I was coming up as a young child and as a teenager, being black as a coal wasn't something that made you smile.  But grandmother made me smile and feel very proud that I looked just like her.
Speaker 1: So she was--this was like one of the first nurturing experiences of your color that you experienced?
Speaker 2: Yes, and, and it wasn't as if my mom [Edna Hayes] and dad [John Hayes] made a big deal out of it one way or the other.  They just let it be.  I was who I was, so--because she recognized it, and she said it, and it was.
Story_ID: 53865
Speaker 1: Now did you hear any stories about your grandfather on your father's [John Hayes] side?  Any stories about what type of man he was?
Speaker 2: I, I heard the same stories.  You know, I, I, I didn't hear many stories, but I knew because they had stayed together and raised these children.  And my [paternal] grandmother [Nita] was still speaking of her husband as if he was still alive.  And for all of my life he was not.  So from that I knew that he was a man that was--that loved his family and, and stayed with his family.  I, I--my grandmother remembers when her grandmother--when they crossed over from slavery.  So I would try to remember to get stories from her.  She--my grand--my grandmother will tell me the story about her grandmother; that she would tell her about when they remember coming over to, to Florida because Florida was not a heavy slave area.  And a lot of people that settled in Florida as actually escaping from Georgia.  And that's one of the things that happened on both sides of the family.  The interesting part about our family is that we have not been able to trace the male lineage, the wem--the female side has been more traceable than the actual male side.
Speaker 1: What type of stories did you tell in regards to the slave crossing over (unclear) share that?
Speaker 2: She just sort of remembers crossing--her grandmother telling her about, you know, sneaking over the border.  And, and she didn't get into great detail.  And at the time when I was hearing these stories, I, I wasn't as interested as I am now, so I didn't really question as, as much as I would do so--as I would do now.  But she certainly remembered the time crossing her--where her family came from Georgia to Florida.
Story_ID: 53866
Speaker 1: Now, about your mother [Edna Hayes], did she ever tell you what it was like as a child for herself growing up in Malone, Florida?
Speaker 2: Yes, both parents, because both of my parents are from Malone and you know, it's, it's an interesting part of--about the family.  As I said, we went back to Malone every year like it was going to Paris (laughter).  We would pack up in that car, and we would, we would leave to go there.  And it was all good stories; you know, it was good stories.  And later on I started to realize about my mom growing up.  My mom--my mom's father [Ed Bowers] I told you died at 14, which left her with a mother [Trudy Bowers] that wasn't well at that time either.  My mother starts to work at 10.  My mother was a very good student.  It's three of them, three daughters.  My mother was very sophisticated, very well educated for the period of time she was able to go to school, but a fine woman.  And she was in a situation where she had to work.  So she started to wash and clean for people in Malone.  I didn't realize the stories, and I, I can't quite figure out people were able to do this.  She actually had to drop out of school by I think it was seventh grade because the next school--the school of the next level was not in her immediate area, and you had to have means to get there on your own, nothing provided by the state or, or the county. So to help support the family she dropped out of school.  She married when she was 16 to my father [John Hayes].  And they celebrate now their 63rd anniversary in good health, and, and spirit.  So I, I knew about her plight, but she never spoke of it as being a plight.  She never spoke of it as being something that was horrible.  She--they saw it as a way of surviving.
Story_ID: 53867
Speaker 1: And the least of the things that they did, they made fun, you know, from going to--oh, I know a good story.  When they got married, my mom [Edna Hayes] and my dad [John Hayes], they had a, a simple wedding in the backyard.  But they moved in with my grandparents on my father's side, you see.  And they walked through the wood path on their honeymoon night to go to my grandmother's house.  And, and that path (unclear) it was probably about four or five miles to get there.  So they loved talking about the woods, and the travels, and what was there, and, and the joy.  I realized on the 75th reunion of the Bowers--we had a very special reunion that year because we went back to the family land.  They kept the family land.  And it's a, a, a house still there that no one obviously can live in, but they cleared the land so that we could walk the grounds.  It was about four or five hundred of us.  And it was a lot of history in that year.  And the--my father, we were riding down the streets of Malone [Florida] in the car together, and my father pointed and said, "That's the tree that Old George was hung in; and you know, right down that road is where they dragged this"--I forget the name of the man--"behind the wagon."  And I said "Wait, wait a minute.  What are you talking about?"  And he started to tell me.  The amazing thing to me, and it was like it blew me away, is that you had to learn to accept it so much that it became a by-the-way conversation.  You understand what I'm saying?  And, and so what they suffered and what they saw there was probably some--something similar to the movie like "Cybil," where you had to have four or five personalities to escape, to survive, because I do believe hate will kill you and eat you up.  So these stories that they were telling me, I was like: you saw that?  He said, "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."  And this was the first time, and this was pretty much about 10, 15 years ago, that I heard this story.  So I know from that it wasn't all good times; it was some difficult times as well.
Story_ID: 53868
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--your mother[Edna Hayes] at the age--so the at the age of 10, so at an early age, she became like probably the person in the household who was really running the household.
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother [Trudy Bowers] was still able to run the household - cook the meals, and make their clothes, and wash their clothes.  But as far as bringing money in for the family, because my grandfather [Ed Bowers] on my mother's side was not a farmer, so he did not have any, any food and things of that nature to leave his children and his wife.  He worked out for other people, so fortunately, there was a lot of brothers that took care and helped my mom's side of the family because of the absence of a father.  So they, they, they survived from relatives that surround them, because that was the Bowers' clan, you know, you'd, you--it was as if all the people lived on the same land, so they took care of each other.  But my mother did work to help to subsidize to the family income.
Story_ID: 53869
Speaker 1: So at the age of 16 your mother [Edna Hayes] gets married.  Did she ever tell you about anything besides about the size of that family and that situation, of what it was like to be that age growing up in that area and not having I guess the things you need just regularly growing up as a person, giving up school and those sacrifices that she made?  Did she ever speak to that?
Speaker 2: She spoke of giving up school because she had a passion for school.  She had a true passion for school, and I, I, I know that she really wanted to continue.  I never heard her complain, and she never complained about anything, she nor my father [John Hayes], because he did not finish as well.  I think they saw it as what I--what do I do next?  So what she did, and she and my father both, is they transferred what they didn't have into their three children.  And, and that has been her career, and that has been satisfying to them.  They worked all of their lives; they managed to send three children to, to college.  My mother made $45 a week as a made when I went--was in--at A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], and my brother at the same time.  My father was a porter at a hotel, living off of tips washing cars, doing whatever he had to do.  And, and we never worked.  My, my parents would not allow the children to work until they completely finished college.  We never borrowed any money to go to school.  That was their mission, and, and they would not let anything stop that.  So, you see, life is, is not a--in my opinion, and I, I guess I get this from my parents--if you think of life, you can't think of one period as being life.  Life in--is until the time you come into the world until the time you die.  So when think, did something in life, you have to put it all into--roll it up in one.  Maybe you missed getting your own education, but fulfilling and giving three of your children an education so offsets and, and more than equalize what you didn't get.  So for my mother's life, what she missed, I think she's more than a hundred times gained.
Story_ID: 53870
Speaker 1: What type of woman was your mother [Edna Hayes] would you say?
Speaker 2: Strong, didn't play the radio (laughter).  She didn't play anything.  My mother is--she--everything had to be just right.  It, it was nothing, nothing that I could think of hat, that, that could not be right.  She was homecoming mother for the school; she was Ms. PTA [Parent-Teacher Association]; she worked; she made all of our clothes.  She could go into the, the, the finest of a store, and look at a very expensive garment and remember it in her mind, make the pattern, make the dress, and you could not tell that it was something that was not from an expensive store.  She always believed do not buy cheap.  Save until you could buy the best and then make it last, and you won't have to replace it, accumulate, okay, save.  She's an excellent cook.  She cooked all types of food.  As a matter of fact she eventually went into catering and was very successful at it.  She was a woman that kept an impeccable home, and you had to make sure that it was that.  Our punishments came mostly from not doing what we had to do around the house.  So she, she was very much into presentation.  Presentation to her set what you were about.  And that, that did not stop with one thing.  It was from the way that you carried yourself; and the way--what you carried on your body; the way your home looked; the way you kept your home, presentation; the, the way you presented your food, the way you set your table.  It was all about presentation.  I--what I did learn from her and this--probably she would never remember that sh--this, this particular incident, but it set a pattern for me that if I ever pick up my hand to do something and promise you something, it's gonna be the best I can give you.  So therefore, I don't promise too much, because I can't give but so many bests within a certain period of time.  But I was folding clothes.  I just--we, we--that was a simple task, to fold the clothes that was to be fold.  And I fold her nightgown, one of her nightgowns, and I just fold it, and it was on the wrong side.  And when she took it out of the drawer and saw it was on the wrong side, she says how could you do that?  How could you not realize that you were doing a job that was so important and fold it on the wrong side?  You, you--if you ever de--if you're gonna do something for me, you must always do it the right way.  And I, I, I couldn't figure it out at first, like what is the big deal about the nightgown (laughter) being on the wrong side?  But it wasn't about the nightgown; it was the attitude that was taken in doing the job.  And, and that probably happened to me when I was about 12.  Now, all of the, the, the whippings, the beatings, the, the whatever, may have gone away, but that, that never went away from my mind because to me it was such a small thing, but she made such a big thing out of it.  You, you see what I'm saying?  And so it impacted me greatly.
Story_ID: 53871
Speaker 1: Now do you think that was an extension of the Bowers' family tradition?
Speaker 2: I think everything is.  I, I, I think that it's so much strength in the world tradition and family, and it just goes on and on and on.  And, and you certainly just don't pick it up and start from nowhere.  You know, it, it--it's, it's not a one-generation experience in most cases, so I think so.
Speaker 1: Now about your family's mother, the Bowers--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who was--that you know of in your knowledge that what your mother [Edna Hayes] might have told you--who was the one who was keeping that information and keeping the records for the family about the traditions of the family?  How did it pass on from generation to generation?
Speaker 2: The matriarch that's passed away in my--I, I guess in the last eight years was Frank Bowers; he passed away at 90.  And we always had one of his lin--you know, of that age, and it was a verbal history within the--it was the oldest one of the family.  And as I said, in my lifespan it was Frank Bowers, and he had 13 children that he educated all of them as well that was my mother's age.  So that's pretty much--and, and this family is kind of--is confusing because they kept naming their children after the other one, the brothers, the uncles.  So you, you have a, a field of the same names.  And, and sometime you wonder well, which one was my great grandfather.  If you had one Frank, you may have ten Franks; if you had one Nora Bowers, you had ten.  You, you see what I mean?  It was just that much power in the way they felt about passing their name on.
Story_ID: 53872
Speaker 1: And through that oral tradition, did--and it being passed down, did they ever--is there ever any one name or one story that transcends of like the person who really started it going, or the person who made sure of how that was gonna last forever, or a person who said I'm determined to make this family tradition?
Speaker 2: Yes, my Great-Great-Great Uncle No--Nolyar Bowers. And Nolyar Bowers (laughter)--I have to laugh every time I tell the story because my husband [Arzell Powell], who, which he started to go to the reunions with me 21 years ago.  We've been married now 18 years.  After going the first five times, he said oh my God, are they gonna tell the same story again?  Ha, I know the story (laughter), and it's a story that we have to repeat every year.  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's part of our, our, our reunion.  It's, it's starting off the getting the family together and with two bags of groceries in the backyard of Nolyar Bowers, pulling his family together.  And he was the one that set, which was probably a little over 80--we're now at 87 years.  So I think that his may have gone back to 90, before it started to be recorded three years.  But what they said is that he was the one that pulled everyone together and said this family will always remember who they are and where they came from.  So the three bags of groceries is a very important part of our, of our history, because this is what he started it with.  He, he started, you see, with a dinner.  And that--that's something that we've learned in our family, is that--we're not very fancy--I have to back up.  We go to hotels now (laughter), okay, and we, we have these, these things that at banquet halls and so forth.  But when we started off, we, we started off with what we could afford; it was food.  And I'm going back 90 years ago or 87 years ago.  And you know, we used to take that for granted, that it was just potato salad and chicken, but it wasn't about that.  It wasn't about the chicken and the potato salad.  It was about the, the, the, the, the, the, the spirit that was in the house and socializing with whatever you had to bring to the table.  Because for many years they had it like potluck; you know, you bring whatever you could.  But it, it, it was, it was, it was kind of like the movie "Soul Food"--you, you--and the, and the meaning behind that dinner.  That's what the reunions were about, because we didn't span out to a weekend like we do now.  It was that day that they got together, and they sat around and they talked.  And the talk may have been light talk; could have been about what this brother did or that brother did, but it passed on, and it kept going, and it kept going and going.  So, that--that's the part that we remember most, is, is the three bags of groceries.  But look what those three bags did?
Speaker 1: And how did your mother pass these stories on to you?
Speaker 2: She really didn't have to because they--she made sure that every year that was built--our vacation time was built around the second week of July, so we--that was the first weekend.  And we would stay to Malone [Florida] in the coming part of, of the rest of the week.  So the stories, I heard it from everyone, you know, for once--and, and that's really what, what the meaning of taking us.  Now you know what's interesting?  I've, I've been running this company for 28 years, and no one here has a choice.  The entire office and plant shuts down the second week of July.  You know why, right (laughter)?  And, and we've been doing that now for the dur--for the entire time of the company.  It's, it's no question.  If you wanted to, you take a vacation; that's the vacation time.
Story_ID: 53873
Speaker 1: Now I'd like to talk about your mother [Edna Hayes] and father [John Hayes] meeting in Malone [Florida].  Explain how they met each other.
Speaker 2: Whose side you want, my mom's or dad (laughter)?
Speaker 1: You can give us both versions of the story.
Speaker 2: Well, of course, my moth--my mother talks about my father, that he obviously was in hot pursuit.  And he was a very talkative guy, talked too much, but she really did like him.  He, he--the romance was a romance of about five or ten--six miles apart, so the, the courtship meant that he would have to literally walk to, to see her.  Her mother--and you know, he was very much into being a part of her life, so this didn't really mean anything.  And so and her mother obviously, she was--well, not obviously, but her mother [Trudy Bowers] was very strict, so the, the, the courting had to be within the presence of--in eyesight of my grandmother.  Now, my father on the other hand, they called him Jack for jackrabbit.  He was a sport, always has been, always will be.  He had a dog named Buster, and he talks about how him and Buster would take that long trail walk to go visit my mother, okay; that Buster was his best friend.  And when they got married--so my father managed to sway her to marriage.  Not really because they were ready at 16 and 18, but my grandmother had remarried, from my understanding, and she married a minister, and this minister wasn't a, a very kind person.  He was a, a very strict person and, and caused my mother a lot of grief, and she just thought he was not a fair person.  So she, my, my grandmother separated from him for other reasons and decided to take her back in her life.  And my mother said that she said if you take him back, I can't stay here.  And my father then said, well then you'll marry me, and you can move away from here.  And that's really the, the, the marriage story (laughter). It, it stounds--sounds like an escape story, but obviously it was more than that 'cause they're still together, right.  And so--but that's, that's pretty much how they, they tell the story of the marriage and the courtship.
Story_ID: 53874
Speaker 1: Your father [John Hayes], what type of--talk about his childhood and what type of--
Speaker 2: My father's childhood, what do I know?  Obviously my mom [Edna Hayes] talks more than my father--(unclear)--just as the knowledge of thing that were talking about.
Speaker 1: Pause here or a moment, pause.
Speaker 2: Oh, father's childhood, okay.  My father's childhood was with both of his parents for most of his, you know, childhood, and was raised on a farm.  They did have a, a lot of farmland.  So his lifestyle was one of working pretty much all of his life, you know, as a farm child.  He--there is five of them.  My father is the youngest of, of the five children.  It's four boys and one girl.  And I think the only thing that I've heard a lot about my father's childhood is from people that still lives in Malone, because my father is, he's like a happy, fun-loving, laughing kind of guy.  And it seems that that's been his personal throughout of his li--his life.  He got his name Jack--his name is John, but the word Jack came from the word jackrabbit because he was always bouncing about.  Even at the age of they tell it six months he jumped out of the bed and didn't hurt (laughter) himself.  So his childhood was like it, it, it--from what I understand and what I get from it is this happy, happy-go-lucky person that understood where he was but was determined to have a ball with it at the same time.  He dressed nice regardless of the situation that he was in.  All of the photographs, you know, his shoes were always shined; he had on really nice clothes.  And he loved to dance.  He probably, if he hadn't met my mother, could have been a gigolo (laughter).  I am my father's child.  That's what everyone tells me.  I love to joke; I love to have a good time.  I've--my mother says to my father, John, you should stop lying.  I says mom, he's joking; he's telling a joke.  But there you are, the straight one and then the other one.  So my father is--he, he's, he's a, he's very--you asked me about his childhood, and I know I'm skipping to his adult life.  I just--I didn't realize what a man this was until, you know, like most of us, until we're, we're adults.

Speaker 1: But you can't have a family like ours with just one person.  And that's why I, if I had any wish, I wish that people would get married, stay married, and raise their children, because I can attest to such an important part of having both there--one, a no-nonsense person.  My mother [Edna Hayes] was a no-nonsense person in a lot of ways, but my father [John Hayes] was a person of few words.  So if you made a promise to him, you had to keep it.  And I learned that if you make a promise to my mother, if you cry long enough and sad face, she'll hug you and say okay, baby, we'll make it work.  So with my father, I'm, I'm so proud that I had someone that loved us.  When you saw the Hayes family, you saw the Hayes family.  When, when they drove to church, you saw the Hayes family, okay.  When they went on vacation, you saw the Hayes family with my daddy sitting there at the hem.  When you sat at the dinner table, which was every night, you saw the Hayes family, and he sat at the head of the table.  He wasn't trying to rule the family; he just had a huge sense of presence there.  So for me, I, I know that having a man of, of any type in a life in a family is very important.
Story_ID: 53876
Speaker 1: And with your father [John Hayes] and these characteristics you've described, where did he ever tell you in part where he learned these things from?
Speaker 2: I would say from his father and his--and, and a lot from his mother.  One thing that, that I've heard.  The difference when you're, when you're a farm boy and you're raised on a farm versus a city, you learn the sense of importance of time, because when you're farming time does not wait on you.  If it's time to pick the corn, it's time to pick the corn.  If it's time to plant the corn, it's time to plant the corn.  If it's time to do whatever, it's do it at that moment, and he's like that.  It, it's like a time to do everything, and he learned that from farming.  Whereas, now a lot of people you see don't get where they need to be because they say I'll put that off tomorrow-- till tomorrow: I'll do that paperwork tomorrow.  And you and I know the problems with that, okay.  But being a farm boy, you bring to the table a timely order and a sense that you don't half do it because the crop wouldn't be right.  You must do it the right way to get the best result of the vegetable and, and, and, and, and, and the things that you're raising, so his experience that, that I see.  And, and what he did is when we were coming up as children we always had one of the best looking homes in the neighborhood, not that my--we never--they never hired anyone to do anything, okay.  My father was--he was the outside; my mother [Edna Hayes] was the inside.  My father's lawn was in--was beautifully manicured; it was totally green.  The house got painted.  He took all of his farm labor and, and, and understanding.  It was a time to paint; there was a time to plant; there was a time to mow the grass; there was a time to do all of these things and, and, and put us in an environment that we were proud to be in.
Story_ID: 53877
Speaker 1: So you've just explained that your mother [Edna Hayes] has one personality.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your father [John Hayes] another.  So during that courtship how did that work?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I, I'm, I'm not sure of too much during the courtship.  And that, that part, only thing that they shared with us that I remember was the wedding, and how they get met, why they got married, and, and the walk from the, from, from the--where they had the reception to the house.  I think it's been a lot of fire and water over the years (laughter).  I've seen some of it once I got to be older that, you know, that it wasn't--my father will laugh--back off and laugh, and my mother would keep going, and--but--and that's the balance; that's the balance.
Speaker 1: So now your parents got married, and they live in Malone [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What brings them from Malone to where they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was--good.  My--there was no work.  My mother said--remember, my mother was, was not a farm girl, okay, and she didn't intend to be a farm girl.  So when my mother and father got married, they went to stay with my grandmother--my father.  And she was a farm woman; you know, you, you, you do farm work.  And my mother was whispering in his ear every night: "We have to get out of here (laughter); we have to get out of here.  I'm not a farm girl.  I don't like this."  She didn't mind cooking, and she didn't mind doing.  So when my father left from the deep woods--now you have to understand my grandmother's house was in the middle of the deep woods--they went then to the City of Malone and, and had their little home with my grandmother waving by his (unclear) and telling my father: "You're gonna starve trying to eat out of a paper bag," which simply meant going to the grocery store (laughter).  And--but they settled, and they had this little house within the city, which meant that my father had to find city work or a town.  I should say town; it's still not a city.  And from my understanding, it was not work there, so he started to move about driving trucks, doing various things, and coming home when he got a chance to be with his family.  Float--Fort Lauderdale [Florida] was part of, of that voyage of trying to find a, a place to work and make money.  So he was here, I understand, for about six months, found a job, found a one-room place, sent for his family, and here we've been since.
Story_ID: 53878
Speaker 1: I wanna ask your relationship with your mother [Edna Hayes].  What type of relationship did you two have?
Speaker 2: The relationship with my mother is, is, is loving.  It's more observing her, okay.  I grew up in many ways afraid of my mother, not, not, not in a loving way.  But she would say things to make me really think that she would do what she was saying; I really mean that.  She, she would say I'll kill you about something.  I really felt that she would.  I don't know.  I just felt that.  I think I had so many rules in my own head, not that--it was three of us, so each one of us looked at it differently.  But I was always concerned about making her happy, you know, if I would do the right thing, say the right thing, and present myself in the right way.  I was not like my sister, so therefore sometime that bother me because I knew the way my sister [Almedia Bannerman] was, was more like my mother.  Until today that's still true.  I had my own agenda.  Like, I, I wanted to do things the right way, and I wanted to do 'em very well, like ironing clothes or if it was my time to cook a meal.  But I didn't see--understand why I had to get up and do it right then, (laughter) okay.  I didn't understand that when it was my turn to iron my clothes--and I would come home-- get home from school at 2:00, and I only had to iron my school blouses--why I had to start on it as soon as I put my books down.  It's--it, it--I, I thought it was only important if I did it before the day was over, but my mother was about time.  So we had a rough go of it because I--she was working, and things that I, I would put off, I would hide, like wet clothes (laughter).  And they were mildew.  I mean I would literally hide them so she would not know that I had not did them.  So eventually she would find them.  That woman could find anything (laughter), and she could sniff out a room.  And she would find them, and of course you know I was, I was history; I was meat, dead meat.  And, and that was--it was, it was like that.  But I never understood, and it, it made me all--I, I was never a person that you tell me something and I accepted it.  I, I, I can't do that; I've tried.  It has to be proven to my, to my thoughts.  You understand?  It's--and my mother was--her way of raising is to just tell you and then you was to do it, so I had many problems with that.  Now, obviously, it's not a problem because I realize that we can't be the same.  It is the way she looks at things and the way I look at things.  But my, my, my closeness to her was a closeness in love but was a great distance in understanding.  And for me, dist--understanding was more important than anything else.  I just wanted to understand.  And my mother's word for understanding was just do it (laughter).
Story_ID: 53879
Speaker 1: Now you said on one hand, your sister [Almedia Bannerman] was more like your mother [Edna Hayes].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you desire to, or did you have a fear, of disappointing your mother?
Speaker 2: I--not disappointing her.  I use the word disappointed--not disappointing her but wanting to--wanting her to see that I was similar to her; that I was gonna get the job done; that, that to have her to know that I was going to get the job done, and I didn't want to be judged by when I did it, okay.  So that was pretty much wanting to be more like--my, my sister, on the other hand, if you told her to do something, she got up and she did it right away.  She understood the rules.  She understood don't question it, just get it done.  Why start trouble?  I, I--and I, I couldn't do that in, in good faith.
Speaker 1: So that distance an understanding between your mother and you as a child.  What types of problem did that cause?  How did those problems manifest themselves in your relationship at that age?
Speaker 2: From a child's eye, it was totally different than my mother's 'cause we've talk about it briefly, not in length, because my, my parents didn't grow up on psychology (laughter).  So, you don't start a conversation about psychological and psychology, those kind of things.  But it, it, it distanced it because there was so many things in my head I wanted to tell her, and so many secrets, and so many like casual conversations, you know, just girl talk that I wanted to, to, to talk about.  But because I had her so on this pedestal, you see, we never had girl talk.  I didn't know how to come to her and do girl talk.  And, and, and for me that was like I, I think we should be doing that; I think that we should just be just talking about non--you know, things of nonsense.  But--and, and, and so it has restricted our conversation even to this day, because you just don't come up and start talking about it.  Like, I would never talk to my mother about sex, never; even now I would never talk to my mother about sex.  I, I would never talk to her about certain issues or my beliefs, because she would say to me--she thought for the longest (unclear) time that I didn't like white people.  And I would tell her: no, I never told you I--and she still says that by the way (laughter): "You know, Cecil never..."  I said no, it wasn't that.  I was--it was I get--I'll tell you want it was: My mother did maid's work, right.  And she, she talked--when she sent us to college, she and my father [John Hayes], they worked very hard.  And she would talk about--she was--but she wasn't always treated the best.  And she would come home, and she would complain about certain things that she was doing that she wasn't hired to do.  And when I would say things, she would say: Well, you know, you sh--yeah, well, that's right, but you have to appreciative, because if it wasn't for the fact that people hired me, I wouldn't be able to do x, y, and z.  And I said, but they're, they're getting their work out of you.  It's, it's not about being appreciative; it's about doing--you're doing your job, you're doing it well and--but you still can ask for people to respect what you need to do.  So, in that vein, she had an opinion that I realize some of my far-fetched ideas was best to be quiet because it would be misunderstood.
Story_ID: 53880
Speaker 1: So your relation--what was your relationship like with your father [John Hayes]?
Speaker 2: In--oh, my father?  Fun; we didn't talk about serious thing, you know.  We, we would play a lot, laugh a lot.  I can, I can--we can make jokes and realize (laughter) it was, it was only a joke.  So the relationship was, was laughter and fun when I was coming up.  My mother [Edna Hayes] would say to him--the, the children still riding his back, and he's trying to dump us off and we're about 10 or 12-- that, you know, we were making too much noise, okay.  That was my relationship with my father.  I always knew that my mother ran the house now.  I mean in her own way, she, she, she ran that house.  And my father was the silent one, but when he said something, he meant it.  If he hit you, he hit you once, and you remembered it forever, okay.  So he didn't take anything for granted.  I, I was always afraid to present any man in my life to my father, because I, I was--it was very important to me that it was the right person.  'Cause although he may not say anything to me, but I knew what he expected of me; you know, I know what he expected me to bring home.  So if it wasn't right, I sort of just dated outside (laughter) of that.  And you know, my life was, was really controlled a lot by images, I gotta tell you.  Now that I look back, it was--and it wasn't--it was what I wanted them to see of me rather than what I saw of them.  And I don't mind that, because I think it made me a better person.
Story_ID: 53881
Speaker 1: In my adult life now what was my father [John Hayes] like?  What I found out about my father and what I love about him: My mother [Edna Hayes] always made sure that we understood that she was there to make things happen for us, you understand, like: I worked hard so you all can go to college; I worked hard so you all can have nice clothes and these amenities of life, all right.  But, if we got into any problems, she would come and say: Oh, well, here; I'll do this for you, and you, you pay it back whenever you can.  When I first started the company, I got into straits about two years later, and I had to go to my parents and borrow $10,000.  And they we'll talk it over with each other, and they did.  And they--so my father says: Fine, when are you gonna pay it back?  And I thought, dang, I thought I'd bast--bypassed the bank.  And I, I gave him date (laughter), okay, a, a date.  He says fine.  Now, as I was--and I was staying with them.  Now that's what makes it hard, see.  So I was staying with them, and some of my times of payment wasn't right on time.  And my mother would say baby, I understand; you know, you're working hard; you're trying to work it out.  My father will look at you like: When you gon' pay it back?  You gave us a date.  I literally hated my father at a moment (laughter) for that.  I thought, doesn't he see that I'm trying, you know.  And he, he, he just let me know by his face that he expected of me to do what I said regardless.  What I learned from that, because from--you know, I have had to go to institutions; I've had to deal with things much different in life than people that work for other people.  I've been working for myself for most of my adult life.  My mother taught me the love, which is great; my father taught me the world, which was great too, that the world expects you to do what you say you're gonna do.  And I--that, that's what I learned from my father, and, and I, I shouldn't hate the world because I gave a promise.  So, he, he was good for me in that, that, that, that way.
Story_ID: 53882
Speaker 1: Now I want you to describe to me the household and how it worked, mother [Edna Hayes], father [John Hayes], the three siblings, how the interaction and how the process of the responsibilities in the household worked.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  My father--my mother took care of the interior from deco--designing, decorating, to washing, to making sure that the clothes was--anything involved inside of our home my mother took full charge of it.  My father took full charge of anything was outside the house or small mechanical things inside the house that had to be repaired.  If he could do it in--he would try, okay.  My father - cars, his car, and at one point cars were always shined and cleaned on Sunday; and, and anything, the lawn, as I--the painting of the exterior of the house.  Literally, when my parents would get home, you wouldn't see my house--my father in the house until it was dinnertime.  He was outside doing something outside of our home, keeping it up and taking care of it, okay.
Story_ID: 53883
Speaker 1: Once you got inside of the house, the three of us, we were all so close together in age until responsibility was pretty much the same.  But, the one thing is that we had--the girls always get more work than the boys.  My brother [John Hayes, Jr.] had less work to do on the inside, and that's a terrible thing.  It's still going on I think (laughter), separation in the sex.  But when--I think by the time I was 10, I was certainly washing dishes.  We had turns to do that; we had a week.  It was a week from Almedia, a week for John, and a week for Cecil, to keep down the confusion, you see.  We were givin' a--our 25 cent allowance--I remember that--a week, when we were little kids, okay, to do whatever we wanted.  I started to cook probably--I had a day--a week--to cook.  My sister had a week to cook, during the week.  My mom always cooked on Sunday and Saturday, on the weekend.  But she would not get home from work before we get from school, so she taught us to cook.  So I think about 12 or somewhere about there I started to cook simple meals.  My, my--the responsibility in the house was not to take advantage of the children, because my mother pretty much had a clock that you did everything at a certain time.  So cleaning the house was touching it up.  But on Saturday, our day was spent cleaning the house, okay, and cleaning.  I don't mean wiping over.  We scrubbed pots outside in the sand, so she'd get all the black off.  That was--they had to be shiny (laughter), okay.  We, we only ironed our clothes that we wore to school, and my mom would take care of all the rest, the, the, the dressy clothes as well.  And we, we sat down to dinner every night at the dinner table and we talked, some good talks, so not so good talks.  But that was our gathering.  Every Sunday we, we went to church together.
Story_ID: 53884
Speaker 1: We--well, what we knew to be a vacation--my parents [John and Edna Hayes] were involved in everything we did, school or what have you.  I think they kept a lot of things away from us that they felt like wasn't good for us to know.  Racism was one of the things.  I didn't realize things that we couldn't do because of racism until I was an adult, because they made the surroundings so that we didn't know.  We knew we were going to segregated schools but other things.  One interesting thing that I didn't know was: We would go on this vacation.  And we would get in the car and drive to Malone [Florida], which was approximately a nine-hour drive.  And it was a caravan, my cousin, their children, and, and, and my aunt and her children, and us.  And we--I thought we were going on a family picnic--because they would make these huge baskets of food, potato salad, chicken (unclear)--and we would stop at this park halfway and eat lunch.  For the children it was great.  You know, we thought this was a family outing.  Then on some occasions we would travel to a place called Perry, Florida, and go to this little restaurant in the back where this huge, charming, wonderful black woman, big lady, will come and serve the largest, most spectacular hamburgers in the world; didn't realize the reason we were eating out of a basket with the chicken and the browns was because we couldn't stop and eat at restaurants, okay.  It was our parents' way of saying we're having a good time.  When we went to this place in the back, I didn't realize it was a huge restaurant in the front where all the whites were served, and the blacks were literally served in the kitchen.  But the--so these things we did not know, and my parents sort of didn't make a big deal of saying: "Look at that that.  They're there and we're here."  It was still about how can I make my family enjoy this, what we call vacation?
Speaker 2: And do you think that was best--the best (unclear) for them to do that, do it that way, to make you insular to it or secure you from it?
Speaker 1: Well, for me it worked.  I mean you, you can--God, I can't imagine having a young mind being taught hate, because you don't have a way to discern it.  So if I was--when I was young and they had pointed it all out, and I didn't really understand it and discern it, I, I would probably be very hateful.  But for me, I think it worked better for me to start to find out things as I got older, and, and certainly I wasn't my age now before I found out.  I was in my--about 18 to 20, early twenties, you see.  So for me it was better because there are issues now that I'm finding out that I have to be careful not to get into an area of hate versus trying to understand.
Story_ID: 53885
Speaker 1: What's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory was when I was about three years old.  And what I remember about it is that this--we were staying, stay--living on--in, in a shotgun duplex area.  It was our first space that we--second space we lived in when we came to Fort, Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  But I started--I think I started to come into my own of thinking things out for myself, three or four.  And all the kids in the neighborhood play, and I would like to be a loner.  I, I was--I loved being alone.  And I was playing and making food in a little can, and I was talking to myself.  And I was just--I was having the best fun.  And I remember those days very fondly and very well, and I loved them so much.  And I reflected back on 'em just talking to myself.  And I said why did you have so much fun talking to yourself?  That's kind of next to crazy, ain't it (laughter)?  But I, I know now that I had a, a joyful time trying to find out who I was.  And by talking to myself, I imagined a lot of things.  I was able to use my imagination.  I didn't have to explain it to the other kids.  I didn't have to--so I, I finally remember those days that I created all of these things in my head.  And, and that was about when I was three years or--three or four.
Story_ID: 53886
Speaker 1: In the Fort Lauderdale [Florida] community that you were growing up in (unclear), explain what that community was like in your--during your childhood.
Speaker 2: Well, this was--where you're staying now in Coconut Creek [Florida], this was farmland.  Fort, Fort Lauderdale, as I was growing up, stopped at 441 - tremendous growth, tremendous growth.  When I away to teach school in Georgia and came back in a four-year period, I was--I had to have my mother [Edna Hayes] to show me around.  I, I couldn't figure out how to get around here.  There was--what it was like when--one high school--one--started off with one school, Dillard Walker Elementary, okay.  Everyone went to the same school.   Remember that school; it's school here.  It's, it's a historical site, but I do remember it.  Then I was one of the first students to go to the first built Dillard Elementary School, the first elementary school that was built separate from high school and, and what they call middle school.  So I remember that; I remember the first school, you see.  We obviously was all--it was segregated.
Story_ID: 53887
Speaker 1: But Florida was a very special area especially South Florida.  Segregation wasn't hardcore in South Florida like it was many places because it was a tourist area.  So they didn't want any rioting, marching 'cause we depended upon tourist dollars.  So everything here was a lot easier.  It, it was separate but no lynching and calling people nigger.  It, it wasn't like that.  You knew where you were supposed to be, but it was no hostility in the air like it was in, in the Deep South, you see, and, and even as it was in Malone [Florida].  But it wasn't because of any other reason.  It was a tourist area, so we didn't have all of the rioting and so forth.  We marched in '60' [1960].  I think it was 1960 because there were separate beaches.  A1A [Fort Lauderdale Beach] was the white beach.  And Dania [Dania Beach] was the black beach, and you caught the ferry.  And we--they orchestrated a march.  And halfway down the street marching the counselors came out and said what are you all doing?  Said, we're marching to go to the beach.  They said just, just go to the beach already (laughter).  They didn't want any, any bad press going on here.  But it was, it was fun.  I remember the three homes we lived in.  I remember the first apartment building that was built in the black neighborhood.  I remember that very well.  We lived in the first duplex area that was built on 10th Avenue right behind Bast (ph.) Brothers.  And when we moved to our home on 10th Street, it was because my father got that house as--it was a veteran type of home.  And it was in the prestigious area, little homes and every one lived there; there were teachers, and doctors, and there we were, okay.
Story_ID: 53888
Speaker 1: In your neighborhood that you grew up in on 10th Street in Fort Lauderdale, tell me what, what that community and that neighborhood was like.
Speaker 2: I moved there when I was in the third grade, lots of children.  It was a neighborhood; it wasn't hood either.  It was a neighborhood [clearing throat]--excuse me--there was professional people that lived there.  Back in the day, it wasn't like it is now.  Fort Lauderdale is very scattered where you have people of different economical levels that move in the area in which they can afford.  We were in an area that was the area.  So we had Dr. Coleman lived there, who was a dentist; Mr. and Mrs. Struggs (ph.) lived two doors down.  Both of them were educators, okay.  We had the Jenkin family that lived across the street that the mother didn't work.  I remember she was the first person I, I, I recognize that we call a holy roller.  Remember they wore those thick stockings?  And natural hairdo wasn't popular back then, but it was with the holy rollers.  So we just thought Mrs. Jenkin was very different in her appearance.  But she had seven children, and she didn't work.  And her husband worked at the port, you see.  He was a guy that brought fish in and, and sail fish, you know, for the, for the people that did recreational type of fishing.  And they, they always--that was their, their meal pretty much (laughter) during the week was the fish that was given away, because they didn't particularly eat them; they just caught them for the sport, so you had them.  I mention them because the incredible part about the Jenkins family is all of those children were brilliant.  I don't think their fam--parents were that well educated, but they certainly cared about their children.  Down the, the, the, down the street from us was the Deans.  Mr. and Mrs. Dean, who had four children, he was an educator; she was a housewife.  My best friend in, in, in elementary and in high school was Joycie (ph.) Alexander.  And her three aunts, who were not married, was raising her, and they were all educators.  So we were surrounded; I would say that 70 percent of the neighborhood was educators.  And to us that was like doctors and lawyers back in the days, you see.  But--and then the other half was just working-class people.
Story_ID: 53889
Speaker 1: But what was the neighborhood like?  It was a, it was a family neighborhood, my mother [Edna Hayes], again, being the matriarch of the neighborhood.  I, I, I said she didn't plan anything, which she didn't, but she liked organizing things.  So we were the only--we were on--I said 10th; 10th was the first street; then we moved to 21st.  The one that I'm speaking of now, where I was really raised most of my life, was 21st Avenue.  So 21st Avenue was--obviously was 20th, and then 19th, and 18th--we were allowed to go as far as 18th Street for one simple reason: that was where my aunt lived, my moth--sister.  But my mother and eight--those streets were divided, but yet they come together, and everyone knew everyone.  So my mother says oh, we should do something with the neighborhood kids during the summer.  So she orchestrated a weenie roast, which meant that we all had our little tasks to go around with our notebook to go knock from door to door with children, and say would you like to come?  Would you like to bring buns, hot dogs, mustard, ketchup, whatever.  And we had the first weenie roast at our house.  And all the children would look forward to it, to the point that 20th, 19th, and 18th Street wanted to join in.  But it--and it was a--it was something then that became twice a year that this weenie roast would take place.  And the, the good part about it, and I didn't realize at that time, that my mom was teaching us that if you get people together, to pull together, you could make something wonderful happen, and that's what we did.
Story_ID: 53890
Speaker 1: The other great thing is that behind our house, we weren't--we were close to the railroad tracks; now you could hear the trains, but the distance between our home and the railroad tracks--the tracks--was about a hundred feet.  And occupied in that hundred feet was low-bush type of forest of greens with some pine trees, which made an excellent playground for, for us during the summertime.  So during the summer, the kids would clear a certain area in that wooded area, and that would become our baseball field.  We didn't have to play in the street.  During one summer, after I went to a place called Africa USA, which took you on a little Charlie train and to show you various animals, I said we're gonna make us an Africa USA.  So my brother [John Hayes, Jr.], and my sister [Almedia Bannerman], and one other person, we organized a company, and we cry--created pathways through the woods, okay.  And each thing that we ran across, if it was a stump, a stump, we would name that stump something and, and tell him that was a historical point about the stump.  We created a hut made out of palmetto bushes; then we created a ride.  We took a, a wooden box, tied a rope to it, and that was the ride that we would ride people through the forest to Africa USA.  My sister, her role was to dress like an African.  And when someone come to the hut, she had a name and she had to say her name.  We took old soda water bottles that was coke bottles, rinsed them out, mixed up colored water with sugar, and sold it as sodas and other things that we could see.  So we sat up our own little venture in the back of these woods and called it Africa USA.  And the kids had to pay to come (laughter) and get a ride.  So it--and, and these are the type of things we did during the summer.  There was always a project of something big and grand going on being made in the woods back there, clearing if off.  So it was a neighborhood of kids and, and, and a lot of adventures.

Speaker 1: Your school, talk about the schools that you went to beginning with your elementary school and the name.
Speaker 2: I attended Walker Elementary, that I told you to stated that it was (unclear), the entire school body, high school, junior high.  And by the third, third grade, they built Dillard Elementary, which was very--a wonderful experience because it was brand new.  From Dillard Elementary, they did have a Dillard High School, high and middle school combined.  I've completed Dillard High School in 1963.  I knew within my sophomore that I loved art, that I wanted to be some type of artist.  My teacher, Mr. Benjamin Williams, who was teacher for two years, actually was part of helping me to feel that experience of being--wanting to be an artist.  But I will give the full credit to Mrs. Bivens, who was my second grade teacher.  Mrs. Bivens--my first grade--I'm backing up, but it's, it's about the art experience.  My first grade year was not a great experience because there was too many other teacher pets in that class, and I just went unnoticed.  Second grade Mrs. Bivens noticed my drawing, and it was like an Egyptian drawing with both feet going the same way.  Well, Mrs. Bivens, with her huge self and beautiful smile, she says: "My goodness, baby, this is so gorgeous."  And my eyes lit up, and I says ah, I found something that I can get some attention.  So I create--kept drawing, drawing more and more and more and more and more and more, and the more I drew the better I got at it.  And then Mrs. Bivens says, "You're over the bulletin board."  And I took the bulletin, and I excelled at the bulletin board.  So Mrs. Bivens got me to drawing because she gave me a compliment.  And that, that desire and that attention kept going because that's what I, I, I excelled in.  And by the time I got to Mr. Williams in, in high school, it was completely confirmed that's what I would do.  The interesting part is that I wanted to not go to A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], because that was next venture.  I went to Florida A and M University in Tallahassee [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  I really wanted to go into commercial art, truthfully to be a makeup artist, theatrical makeup.  Don't ask where it came from.  That's what I wanted.  And my mother and father says you're crazy.  You're going to a university because you're not gonna starve and come back home.  So I said okay, I'll do my sting, four years, and then I'll make my own decision.
Story_ID: 53892
Speaker 1: So I went to A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], completed four years of an art education, and I taught school in Waycross--Alma, Georgia, working for the federal government.  The job was offered for "undesirable situation, and we will pay you more if you're willing to do it"--it was to integrate the school system of Alma, Georgia, "and it would nice if you were an art teacher because we don't have an art program."  So I did both.  I went to this remote place--that I'd never been to Georgia in my life--and I didn't get a chance to view it, because I had just went for an interview and caught the bus and went back to Tallahassee [Florida], see, and took the job, for the money, didn't realize about the experience.  So I--there was no place to rent there.  My mother [Edna Hayes] had made me all these two suitcases of clothes.  And I had to room at this lady's house, and when I got to the rooming--to the room I was to stay in, I said: Where is the closet?  And she pointed to this huge penny nail on the back of the door (laughter).  So after I stayed there four years teaching, I did move to Waycross [Georgia] after a year of living in her house in, in Waycross--in Alma.  I finally moved to Waycross 36 miles away and commuted.  The experience was great.  I mean my first year there was, it was awesome because everyone barked at me like a dog coming down the hallway.  No one threw anything at me, but I had to deal with the situation.  And then I started programs there that they had never had, and this as an all-white school.  They had never had art.  They had never put on plays.  I wrote plays, taught the kids how to respond to plays.  The principal the first--and this was just on my own; it had nothing to do with my pay--had to actually instruct the students and the audience how to react when they go to a play.  Then I decided, after four years, enough; find out what you wanna do.  And I discovered the Art Institute [The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] and interior designing.
Story_ID: 53893
Speaker 1: And I went to the Art Institute [The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale, Florida].  I started in '72' [1972] [sic].  I finished in late part of '73' [1973], going year-round, doing the summers.  And I was the only black there, okay.  I was the--probably the poorest person there, because most people that go in interior designing are wealthy people.  This is how interior designing was--actually professionally started with people like Gloria Vanderbilt, because she was wealthy, and she knew wealthy people.  But, I didn't know all of this, so I was not only the poorest, I was the blackest there.  But I finished with the highest honors of the entire school.  To this day I still hold the honors of, of best portfolio and best academics.  And I finished in '73' [1973] with, with those honors and couldn't get a job (laughter).
Story_ID: 53894
Speaker 1: I'm taking you back to that elementary school.  I just--your education during that period.  In elementary school, besides Mrs. Bivens, were there any other mentors or any other teachers or fellow students who might have had an influence upon you at that age of that childhood?
Speaker 2: All of 'em were mentors.  I really have to say that they were all--the elementary was, was good teachers.  Mr. Williams, I loved him to death.  He was sixth grade.  Ms. Mango, I think she was fourth grade.  Ms. Stevens were somewhere in there.  And I can--and see, I can remember their names so they were good.  I, I--all of them were good.  I only had one horror story, and that was in fourth grade.  My--believe it or not she was my neighbor.  And she was one of these teachers that liked light-skinned kids, okay.  And if you weren't light-skinned, and I would--by the third--fourth grade, I--you know, we had sections of grades in elementary, the smartest class, the next smartest class, the next smartest, and you went down the line.  By the fourth grade, because of Mrs. Bivens, who paid--who gave me so much attention, I had come up to the level of the smartest class for the next year, in the fourth grade.  But the teacher, you know, just ignorance, she, she had a few people in there that was light-skinned blacks and with curly hair, and she terrorized the other ones that were not.  And, and I guess I've, I've always been af--affected by people that weren't fair.  And it, it caused me a lot of grief.  For--fourth grade was not a good year; that's the only year.  And, and I was so happy when people like Wesley Snipes came out (laughter) because it gave us a little bit of a relief.  Actually it started a little bit before then, but that was, that was a heartfelt year in high--in elementary school.
Speaker 1: And even at that early age where you're experiencing that difficulty of class, how was your art, because I'm assuming you were still drawing?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I was drawing.
Speaker 1: Had--did any of this manifest in your art?
Speaker 2: As far as the feeling of?
Speaker 1: Difficulties you were having with this teacher--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, it, it manifested in my whole personality, because by the fifth grade, I was no longer in the smartest class.  I--it--drawing was not a part of me as much because she changed things.  It wasn't about drawing.  I would sit and doodle, and that was the problem because she, she wasn't capturing--and I was still a child.  So I, I really wasn't paying attention as much.  I was doodling; I was drawing and to, to escape some of the, the horror that I felt in her class.
Speaker 1: So where did you go from there?  At that point, after having experience in that situation in fourth grade and fifth grade and the effects of it, when did you feel that drawing would be something that you could do again and do it for, not just doodling purposes, but actually drawing as a dream?
Speaker 2: I proba--next year.  You know, it was the, the, the, the other teachers from fifth grade on were people that was totally different.  Back--we didn't not have an art program in elementary school.  There were not--that was not an art teacher, so it was pretty much each teacher had their own little (unclear) of things that they like.  So I was only doing it for those teachers that had it, if they really enjoyed teaching art or having some parts of art.  For me, high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] was now the, the, the set aside period of knowing this is what I want because they did have an art teacher.  And it was an elective, and I chose to take it as often as I could, so that was a period that I realized that I, I really was interested in arts--in the arts.
Story_ID: 53895
Speaker 1: So what type of student were you in school?
Speaker 2: Average (laughter), average, not, not anything more or anything less.
Speaker 1: Now your interests, what extracurricular activities were you involved in while you were in school?
Speaker 2: In high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida]?
Speaker 1: In school period, all throughout, what extracurricular act--things did you like participate in?
Speaker 2: I, I, I didn't participate that much in elementary school.  It was a lot that I most--mostly in--elementary school, let me think.  I did--in the May Day.  We had a big May Day every year, and you had different dance and routines that you would do, and I was always excited about being in that.  I don't think that I found my--I, I, I was, I was still this person that was having a lot more fun talking to myself when people weren't noticing, to be very frank with you.  I would actually go in the closet at home.  And I, I, I, I wasn't into anything other than dealing with my creative thoughts.  You, you understand?  It was--it's kind of hard to explain it, but it wasn't that important to me to be that popular in school.  In high school I was briefly, for one minute, a, a junior cheerleader for one year, and that was okay.  It wasn't as if my heart and soul depended upon it.  When I arrived--by the time that I got a senior, I, I really never really cared to be a part of a group or--today I'm pretty much the same way.  I enjoyed going to my art classes.  I participated in class.  I had a lot of friends.  I enjoyed them, but that was about it.
Story_ID: 53896
Speaker 1: So when you were alone and you're creating these worlds and living this--in your mind, these creations, what were you creating in your mind?  What images were you creating and coming up with?
Speaker 2: In high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida]?
Speaker 1: No, just throughout your--when you were escaping by yourself.
Speaker 2: I--well, a lot of it had to do with reasoning.  I--you know when you--one of the things I've understood: now if you're a creative person, it doesn't stop with the visual part, you know, visual meaning people think of art as like you could dance, so I could visually see the movement; you could paint, I could visually see the colors.  I, I--(unclear)-- my mind goes into all kinds of thoughts about why is something.  I do a lot of why, why, a lot of why is this, why is that, is this really the way it's supposed to be?  Because creatively you need to get rid of those demons, so that if you get rid of the demons your mind could just flourish and wander into all kinds of fantasy wonderfulness, you see.  So what I was--what was--what was in--on my mind, and--it was a lot about people, trying to get rid of the demon of people and why they react Why do they expect.  Why is this important?  Why do I have to do it that way?  Why does it have to say that--I didn't get--I didn't understand it.  So I would try--I spent a lot of time doing that.  I, I played with--I had dolls until I was 16, until my mother told me she wasn't gonna buy me anymore.  But I enjoy--I talked to them, and I used to ask them these questions because I would ask other people and they would look at me and go: What you talking about?  That--there's no answer to that; that's not important.  So I, I, I was exploring the mind of entrapment.  That--that's really what I was doing, and I didn't wanna become entrapped.  And I still struggle with that because I think most of what I see in the world is entrapment.  It's, it's hard to be--to explain, but it, it's, it's a world of entrapment.  And I you can ever break those bonds, the, the bond--the bondage of that, you know, it would change your whole life.
Speaker 1: During that time when you're havin these thoughts and your going introspectively and talking to yourself, did you ever meet anyone you could speak with about it that had any answers that you would feel that sa--answered anything to your satisfaction?
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't dare share--yeah, but it was my own voice.  It was, it was--I, I thought that I heard the message of, of how to, to deal with it.  Now where did it come from?  I don't know.  It wasn't a person.  I, I just knew that it was there.  I, I knew, for instance, that it wasn't important for me to be a part of groups even as a teenager.  I knew that it was important for me to figure out who I was first.  Where the voice came from I don't know.  I knew that a--I don't know.  I, I, just, I didn't really talk to anyone if you're asking me did I go to someone and bear my soul, no, I didn't.  It wasn't worth bearing my soul.  I was having a lot of fun talking to myself (laughter); I really was.  I was having a lot of fun asking the questions and then trying to wait for the answers to be figured out in my own head.  So I, I didn't look at myself as a basket case or someone that was having.  It was--it was more fun to me than going out with a group of people.
Story_ID: 53897
Speaker 1: And at what point did this imagination, this time where your voice is--when you're having these moments of time alone, did you start seeing it manifest or you started manifesting in your art, in drawing, in your talents?
Speaker 2: I, I saw it when I finished college, when I finished from Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And one of the good things that happened out of that experience of going to Alma, Georgia, was being lonely and alone, and being separated and having time to think.  That was a good thing, so I started to sculpture.  I started to paint, and, and it really was coming from being bored; it was nothing to do there.  But I started to see, and, and, and you know what?  It's nothing better than being alone, because you start to enjoy yourself.  I realized that; I realized that some of the things that was happening to me is that if I could enjoy myself, I can enjoy anybody.  And if I could put myself in, in the, in the worst of places, which Alma was not far from that, and still laugh, then I would be okay no matter what situation I was in.  So I started to understand the creative questions.  The creative questions wasn't how to paint and how to draw but how to have that freedom to not be afraid and intimated of so many things, you--yeah.  So that was cre--that's the first creative part of it.  So I saw it in Alma, Georgia.  I, I, I was able to get in focus with what I needed to do.
Story_ID: 53898
Speaker 1: When was--one question I do ask, and it refers back to your childhood in the neighborhood on 21st.  What sights, sounds, and smells are there that bring you back to that childhood in the neighborhood when you're growing up there?
Speaker 2: The sound of the train.  The sound of the train.  It got to the point that the train became my friends.  When we first moved there the train was loud, and it was noisy, and it was--we're staying by the tracks.  But the train then started to--we knew the time it was gonna run.  And we, we--they--we knew the hours, and we knew the sound was coming.  Then and we looked forward to the sound.  It became like you learned how man can become conditioned to--from the worst to make it your friend.  Then the train would literally--we would wait to hear the sound so we could go to sleep.  It was like a humming sound, like a smooth melody that put us to sleep, and--the sound.  And you see, that's what I'm saying to you, that when I used to think about things and the creative thing I (unclear)--I could see how you could enslave people.  Because if you put 'em--if you enslave their thoughts, you see, what they start to accept is fine.  So where did that all come from, you know, the, the--these are the things that go in my head, that the train became my friend.  And that's not supposed to be, you know, that you don't mind staying by the railroad track.  The sound is like running water at the ocean.  So you still wanna buy property by the railroad track when there's water that you should be trying to go to.  So it, it's, it's those kind of--I remember the sound.  I don't remember the smell too much, but I remember the, the look.  I remember all the little houses the same, and we would paint 'em different colors.  And the size of the homes were pretty much the same.
Story_ID: 53899
Speaker 1: So you graduate high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida], and you're attempting to choose what institution you're gonna attend for higher education.  Why Florida Agriculture and Mechanical University?
Speaker 2: 'Cause that's where my mother [Edna Hayes] told me I was going (laughter).  It was in-state, no out-of-state fee.  I had not--remember, I was telling them that I wanted to go to art school.  So I had not seeked out a four-year institution.  And because I was not going the direction they wanted, then I wanted so late.  So she says well, "you're going somewhere; apply to A and M," which being in-state, was easier because that's--(unclear) this is our home.  So that's really how I ended up at A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  I don't regret it; I, I loved being there, but that's truly the reason.  It was no desire, no more than being--becoming an interior designer was a desire.  It was not something that I thought about all my life.  I just picked up a book one day and says ah, I'll do that.
Story_ID: 53900
Speaker 1: Now your art abilities, art talents are growing at this point.  You choose your major.  Why do you choose the major, major you choose?
Speaker 2: At A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That was my strength; that was what I felt comfortable in.  It's where I had been given the pat on the back.  Was I the best at it?  I don't know.  But what is something that I rai--or I rose to the occasion because of all the accolades?  Yes, you know, and I felt I found my niche.  Do I feel like now, in my adult life, I could've done a hundred other things?  Sure, I do, but it was, it was the way you direct the mind.  It's, it's how you point it.  To become creative in a lot of ways is not what people think it is, like, oh, I was born with this talent.  You, you're geared towards where you start to get the accolades, where, where--and, and if, if, if you have picked up a pencil as many times as I did to draw, you would be able to draw as well as you could write, okay.  So I, I, I, I developed into the, the, the, the, the area that my teachers started to mold because I wanted attention, and I loved that attention.  And it is--and I've--you know, I've gotten better at my creative thoughts.  I've always had the creative thoughts.  The part I was telling you about, talking to myself and trying to find out the whys, that's creative, whether you take it to one level or another, you see.  The--that's the creative thoughts for me.  Now whether I had become a painter or a sculptor, a dressmaker, a dress designer, or a makeup artist, or an interior designer as I had, it did not matter because I had freed my mind to allow any creative thoughts to come there.
Story_ID: 53901
Speaker 1: At that time, while you're there at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], was the Art Department, that experience--what was that like for you?
Speaker 2: It was good.  It was good.  It was hard because all the art classes you had to take for a major was two-hour long, you know, at length, so that meant I--you had to take more.  Where other majors you had to--it was one hour; you know, in, in minutes and seconds is what I'm speaking.  So, and it was expensive.  My, my--because we had buy all our art materials, which was hard on my parents.  But enjoyed A and M.  I, I, I was exposed to Vespa (ph.); I was in--exposed to going to the opera.  They had it on campus.  So there as a lot of good things about being on A and M's campus.  As far as the art department is concerned, it was small, but it was a hands-on because of the size.  I took more educational courses.  We took--I, I learned a lot about, you know, some painting, some sculpturing, a little bit of this, and a little of that.  But the strangest thing that happened, they never taught me how to teach (laughter).  I had four years.  I never--when I went out to teach, I went oh, my God, they taught me how to draw and how to do this, but no one ever taught me how to teach this thing.  So I had to learn that.
Story_ID: 53902
Speaker 1: So you're at FAM [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University].  And while you're there are there any mentors or any individuals who were influencing you while you're there?
Speaker 2: Well, FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University], let me think.  I knew Bob Hayes, the fastest man in the world (laughter).  And it, it--that was a great charm because Bob was there a few years before me, and we shared the same last name.  So in my eyesight he was the first famous person that became my friend, and so that was very important to me.  It was--meant that because if I was around Bob, that meant I was okay too.  So he was a great influence because it also showed me that people that were famous it's according to where you are.  If you're right around them, they're not so famous.  But outside the circle they're very famous.
Story_ID: 53903
Speaker 1: Did I have anyone else?  Not so much as anyone else, because college was certainly a, a separate and totally different experience than what I explained to you that I expected in high school [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] or very much in elementary [Dillard Elementary School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida].  I wanted all that personalized attention?  Well, when I arrived on A and M's [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] campus, of course the size and the attitude of, of being an adult was certainly different.  So attention was not the order of the day as far as a mentor of such.  It was up to you to, to do what you needed to do to understand and get with the program.  But my first year there was sort of a crazy year anyway because that was in '63' [1963], and the marching had just started.  So my first week on A and M's campus, actually first month, was no classes because the students were getting arrested and putting--being placed in jail.  My brother [John Hayes, Jr.] was among one of those, because of marching for the rights of civil rights.  I truthfully was very, very afraid.  I, I was afraid to leave my room, because I, I said to you I'd never been around hostility because of race.  I'm sure it was in Fort Lauderdale [Florida], but it wasn't showing as it was in the Panhandle, South Florida.  And those people really frightened me; they, they really frightened me.  So that was my first shock of reality, as far as what the world was like.  From that point, on I, I did my thing.  I did my work.  You know, I, I made a lot of great friends.  It was like a big camp - I lived in a dorm with all the girls; I learned how to play bid whist (laughter) and, and, and so forth and so on.  But it was, it was also a great exposure to more finer things in life like I stated.  We went to Vespa, we--which was a similar thing of going to operas, and, and doing those things that started to get you ready for society.
Speaker 2: Now did this--when you went to things like this, did this get you, your thoughts into like theater and the beauty of theater, and being interested in plays maybe and things of that sort?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah, I--well, I, I, I wasn't interested in being in them as much as I focused into what it took to produce them, and, and between the costumes, and how you make sure that you're at this point, at the right point, the stage, and so forth and so on.  So I paid a lot of attention to that in my own mind, and it fascinated me as much as it did for the--you know, when I went to the movie and how they made these happen.  Yeah, I did.
Speaker 2: So that was an interest to you while you were at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.
Story_ID: 53904
Speaker 1: So, now, you're about to graduate FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], and you're attempting to look for work.  And how does the job in Alma [Georgia] come to your attention?
Speaker 2: Well, they had organized for the first year a Board of Placement at A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And what that simply meant was that they would help find students a job.  So I really sort of waited and did not look for a job, did not seek a job, or send out resumes.  I just thought that all school teachers just sort of showed up, and they give you a job (laughter).  And so I was a desperate person.  So at the last minute I went to this Board of Placement, and they says ah, you know, there's this place called Alma, who is Title 1, fun--funded by Title 1.  They need an art teacher, and they need someone black.  And that's how I got the interview, and that's truly how I got the job.
Story_ID: 53905
Speaker 1: And when you go up there and you start working, explain those experiences?  Was it what you expected?  Did you know what you were walking into?  Did you have any idea?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I--and remember I, I--well, during the Civil Rights Movement '63' [1963]--I'm now at '67' [1967]--'63' [1963] I, I literally hid in the, in the dorm room.  So I didn't know what to expect.  I didn't expect it was going to be friendly, but I didn't know anything else that it would be as it as--(unclear)--by six--from '63' [1963], when the movement was in, in its height--sixty-seven [1967] it had calmed down a little bit--they had stopped marching and, and, and beating and water hoses.  It had now gotten to a level where, what can we do to integrate at a slow pace?  So I thought it would be peaceful but not pleasant, and that's exactly what it was.  It was--the school was exactly what I thought.  My lifestyle was nothing like I thought.  And, and the lifestyle was that I wasn't excepted by the whites, nor was I accepted by the blacks.  Obvious--the obvious reasons I wasn't accepted by the whites because they, they weren't ready for what I came there to do.  But the blacks still lived what they called "in the quarters."  They themselves say I live in the quarters, which is an old setback from the word slave quarters.  So where they--they didn't call it a neighborhood; they called it the quarters.  I drove in town.  This black girl that was raised in Fort Lauderdale doing only what black girl from Fort Lauderdale [Florida] know how to do, a certain way I speak, a certain way I dress, a certain thing I expect out of life.  Not looking down on anyone, but I was this fancy negro.  So they didn't have too many--to, too much to, to do with me either, so I was caught (laughter).  And I, I--and I was, I was too young to try to force myself into anyone's life, so I was sort of dug my heals in too, and say well, I'm not gonna lower myself if they don't wanna talk to me.  They heck with them.  So it was, it was a--the first year was a very lonely year.  But what made me stick through it was that my parents didn't--had encouraged me not to go, had asked me to come back home to work--move back home to work, and I was no, nope, gotta go on my own.  So here I go again about my parents' image of me.  I didn't want them to know that I had made a mistake, so I, I, I dug--I lasted through that experience of the first year.  By the second year, I was able to get a car, so therefore I could move from Alma and move to Waycross [Georgia], which was a lot better area to live and commute.  So, I, I, I said to myself oh, give it a trying out in Waycross.  So the second, third, and fourth year I stayed because I changed location.

Speaker 1: Now, what types of-a--who did you influence while you're there, your interactions with the students, teachers, and what influences did this have on you in your growth and the direction it would send you in?
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--the one thing that I remember in reference to--what, what do you call it?  It's like a, a left-handed compliment that I got from one of the teachers.  There was this, this family called the Johnson family, they were white, and they were very well known in the community.  He was the principal of the elementary school, and she was a teacher of English at the high school, and they were very well known.  And they have this one little princess of a daughter named Amy, who I taught art when she was in 10th grade.  Well, you know, teachers got a half-hour break or a 10-minute break, coffee break, in the middle of the day, and they got a lunch break.  And we had a teacher's lounge.  Well, I would come to this teacher's lounge and sit, and no one would speak to me.  So they were on this side of the room, and I was over there with no one to converse with.  And this went on for half of the year.  So finally, I guess after being--they started to talk to me.  I started to talk to them.  And before you knew it, maybe, whatever three-quarters the year in, it wasn't long conversation, but it as conversation.  (Laughter) And Mrs. Johnson says to me on the way out the door--she turns back around and she says: "You know what?  You're nice.  You're not..."  She said, "You know, you're not like the," she said, "You know, you're not like the oth--the other ones."  Now, and she said it in a way that I didn't a chance to respond, and she left.  And I thought about that; I said what did she mean by--then I realized the compliment that Mrs. Johnson paid, and she didn't know on the influence that I did is we all alike.  You just gotta get us to know each other, you know.  I don't know you.  You don't know me.  But if we never spend time together in a situation like we were, you would always think that way.  So her thought was that I wasn't like them.  But the truth of it is, is that Mrs. Johnson had gotten to know someone, and some of her thought patterns had started to change.
Story_ID: 53907
Speaker 1: You know, earlier you spoke about how this was a period of you were isolated and alone.  Now, I wanna know, I'm asking, how did this affect you as an artist?  Was there growth?  Did you see this as something that was positive and how this helped you?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it helped me as an artist.  If it did, I haven't seeked that part out yet.  I think it helped me as far as growth.  I know it did.  As I said, I was isolated.  I had to do a lot of soul searching.  I wasn't--if I had decided to move to a bigger city, I would have been doing what most twenty and twent--twenties do: you're out clubbing; you're having a good time; you're not necessarily finding yourself.  So I think it helped me in the growth of understanding myself.  Now whether that trans--transformed into my art talent?  Maybe, I, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: And during this time are you still drawing?  Are you still--
Speaker 2: Yes, un-huh, I'm drawing, drawing a lot now, drawing more when I moved to Waycross [Georgia], sculpturing a lot more.  Wasn't a city of activities either, but a lot more, lot more people, so yes I was; I was growing in that.
Speaker 1: And how did you develop the Art Department at Alma [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: How did I develop it?  Oh, that's interesting.  Title 1 was supposed to have money there for me to have materials.  Not any of that was there.  They--the interesting thing about those government programs, money was being misappropriated (laughter).  And one of--some that was misappropriated was my budget for my art program.  So when I got there I had to literally take old paper off the bulletin board, cut it up into 8x12s, find old broken pieces of crayon, crayon and pa--pencils, and that's the way I taught to high school students, if you believe it, my first year.  So I started it with nothing.  By the second year I'd understood that something was wrong with this picture.  And I went to the principal and demanded that a budget be set in place for me to buy for, for the art program.  It was, it was people that didn't know anything about art.  Several of the students grabbed it real fast, and understood it, and loved it.  Most of the kids that was taking the course were taking it as a Kreps or you know, just something to do.  And I taught them art history, but I'd learn how to teach.  I learned that you need to be creative in every approach, how to present it so the kids don't get bored.  And they started to love it.  They loved--they learned about the masters.  Because most of them didn't want to learn how to draw or to paint, so I started to teach art history, and we had a ball with it.
Story_ID: 53908
Speaker 1: So after four years here, what motivates you to it's time to make a change?
Speaker 2: I knew it was--a change had to be made when I arrived, but it was a means to an end.  And I wasn't ready to challenge myself, but I did this because I didn't wanna challenge myself.  So from the first year I was there I would say to people I won't be back next year (laughter).  I'm gonna find something else to do.  And you know, by the third year I kept thinking to myself, you're saying this every year.  And I started dating a guy that at one point I thought I really was gonna settle down and, and, and, you know, stay in Waycross.  Thank God he was cheating on me (laughter).  I can't imagine myself living in Waycross [Georgia] now (laughter).  See, you always think things are terrible when they happen, but the truth of it is, is that there's some good to everything.  So that sort of put the icing on the cake.  I says no, this is not worth staying here for either.  And I told enough people this time that I wasn't coming back, and I did that deliberately.  I said if I tell enough people, it would be too embarrassing to show my face.  So I, I, I, I, I set myself up.  I set myself--I did it deliberately to myself.  Do something that's gonna make you move.  And, and I knew that would be to not have people to go you told everybody you weren't coming back and here you are.  And that's when I really started to work on finding where I needed to be next.
Story_ID: 53909
Speaker 1: And where was that?
Speaker 2: That was going back for my first ker--passion.  I started to look for schools that--to teach makeup artistry.  And makeup artistry was pretty New York, California kind of thing, you know, get there and you'll get where you're supposed to be--didn't have the money to do that; didn't save a lot.  I was in a place where you didn't--you didn't have much to do, but it still managed for me to do things with my money.  So I had $1600 that I got from retirement, and I started to look at schools that I could afford.  So I started to look in Florida where I was ga--going to ru--go back to Florida.  The Sarasota School of Art [Ringling College of Art and Design, Sarasota, Florida] was first choice; came home on vacation.  My girlfriend said the Art Institute [The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] has a program they just started.  I started looking through their catalog or brochure.  No makeup artistry in sight, but as my finger was going down the line I thought, interior designing, ah, I'll try that.  And I that's how it happened.  And I enrolled in the class and found out I truly did love it.  And from there I'm here.
Speaker 1: At what moment while you're there did you realize not only did you love it, but I'm good at this?
Speaker 2: After I started to get rid of the, the demons again.  And the demons wasn't about me.  It was that I looked in this class, and I didn't see any of me.  Then I saw all of the things that, that we used to admire when we were over there enjoying the sound of that train, that the people that was over on the other side of the track that was rich, I saw them too.  That was a demon.  The demons were the fears, and the fears was overtaking my, my creative soul, you see.  So once I got rid of that and started to say ah, guess what?  They talk, they, they, they sit on stools, they walk, they--it's nothing for me to think about.
Story_ID: 53910
Speaker 1: How did you get rid of those demons?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Fort Lauderdale Art Institute [The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale, Florida].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay, Fort Lauderdale Art Institute.  The--how did I get rid of them?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I got rid of them by simply associating with them.  And that's the secret; you have, you have to associate and realize that it's nothing to, to fear.  And once I got rid of that and realizing that I could do this thing, then I started to push myself and enjoy it.  I enjoyed, just thoroughly enjoyed--how did I know I was good at it?  We had to present our project before the teacher.  And I knew that mine was pretty much right there with the others.  And as each time it got better and better and better.  And what I really knew, and here's the clincher, I knew that it was something inside of me now, because of most of the things I was doing I had never been exposed to.  So where was it coming from?  And the kid--the other students in the class with me had been exposed to these fine things, and they didn't feel the fabric; they didn't see the texture in it; they didn't under--they didn't see the quality past the fact of it was a certain name, okay.  I, I could see thing just from being free of all of the expectations of it because of the name or because of this and the other.  So that was a joy for me.
Speaker 2: So on graduation you come there and you graduate top of the class.
Speaker 1: Right, I graduated top of the class.  And I knew before that I was possibly gonna--will receive best portfolio.  So, my parents [John and Edna Hayes], my very few friends came.  It was a small group.  And when they called my name, I was nothing like it.  Truthfully, I enjoyed my two full years at the Art Institute more than I did A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] four years.  It was so much fun.  I could stay up all night drawing, and I did many a time, didn't realize it was day.  And I was working.  I was pretty much putting in a, a 15, 16-hour day, between work, school, and homework; and didn't bother me at all, and this was the weekend.  So for over two--the two years I was at the Art Institute that's all I did, school and work, school and work.
Speaker 2: So they called your name for best portfolio and--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --you were saying...
Speaker 1: Oh, the (laughter) academics honor, highest academics of that year.
Story_ID: 53911
Speaker 1: And this leads to you what?  You're the top student, and from there you go to?
Speaker 2: From there I go to interview (laughter).  Portfolio is very important.  It's your way you show your art.  So I called and I made appointments.  And I said who I was, and then I sent--I sent the resumes, which said--told the story.  I was one of the few students that had a B.S. degree, first of all, that was there.  And I had the credit now, the portfolio, and the academics.  So when I would call to make an appointment, oh yeah, sure, we would love to interview you.  When I showed up and was black, it was like I never got the job.  It took me several interviews to realize that (laughter).  I guess I'm a slow learner.  And then it finally hit me that, wow, are there any blacks in this field?  What, what is this?  I thought maybe I was the only black.  There was one of black entered before I finished--that it was because this was just one of many schools, and I--that's when I started to concern myself.  What is it I've gotten into?  But I finally got a job, making $80 a week take home pay at the Santa Stevens.  Santa Stevens is, is a--was a commercial interior design company.  And one of the persons that was owner was one of my teachers at the Art Institute.  He taught me illustration and, and painting, water coloring and, and, and, and other medias of painting.  And I think I was hired because he understood the talent.  But they, too, did the same thing.  I was stuck in the back cataloging books, and I did that for over a year.  But I then started to understand I need to learn what I could.  So the office that I chose to work, including Santa Stevens, was small so that I could actually learn a lot, and that I did.  So I took away not job experience so much; I took away learning when they left the office about how they operated the office.  I went through files and went to the drawing boards.  So I, I took away some learning experiences from there.
Story_ID: 53912
Speaker 1: So at this point, what motivates you?  What's the motivation to start your own business or to seek that out?
Speaker 2: Well, after Santa Stevens, I, I, I worked for two other companies.  One was Miller's Hardware, which actually sold door poles and hardware accessories for cabinets.  They also had a manufacturing shop in the back to make custom units.  I worked for them for three days a week, okay.  I was trying to make ends meet.  Santa Stevens went bankrupt by the way.  I didn't tell you that.  But the company I worked for, you know, the first tenure, they, they failed; they went bankrupt.  And then I worked for Miller's trying to find jobs, but I couldn't find a job so I took these three days.  So I said oh, I'll learn about manufacturing.  I can go in the back and see how they make wall units and cabinetry.  And I did all of their work and drawings, which was on the drafting board.  Then the guy that owned the place, Sid Miller, Jewish man, befriended me.  He said you shouldn't be here.  He said I know a designer.  His name is Steve Frelick (ph.), and he's co-owner of Decorators Unlimited in Plantation [Florida].  We make a few things for him, he said.  He, he, he's talented, but he has no direction.  He needs someone like you to work with him.  I'll give him a call and set it up that you can meet him and maybe get a job, and he did, and I got the job.  So disorganization was not the word for this man.  This--it was like (laughter) unbelievable.  But I worked there and I, I enjoyed working there.  And I, I brought my drawing board, and he had a store that sold accessories.  He was out during the day.  He taught me how to be a decorator.  I knew how to be an interior designer, but I didn't know how to be a decorator.  He taught me how to coordinate and put things together, like hanging paints on walls.  Steve could not draw, and, and--like, like a designer draws, and blueprints, and illustrations, he couldn't do any of that, but he knew how to decorate.  How to coordinate and decorate is the same.  So I learned that from him and--but he was a terrible, terrible businessman.  And he, too, his company went bankruptcy.  My last month working for him I worked for him totally out of love because he, he had--he couldn't pay me.
Story_ID: 53913
Speaker 1: And finally, now here's what happened: I thought about it, and I said I don't want to get back out there through that embarrassing route of interviews and no job.  And here these guys, white guys, that things were made for them to, to be successful, but yet they fail, yet the fail.  And, and they probably are gonna bounce back.  So you know what?  It couldn't be as painful as I heard it is, to try to get a, a company and fail.  It couldn't be as painful.  They're, they're doing it.  So I, I, I started from that thought that I would start my own company, first out of embarrassment, not wanting to go through the pain of interviewing; and second, because I've seen--actually, failure of other people is what gave me the positive thought that I could be successful (laughter).  I, I--and  did that.  I, I, I started the company from a small loan from SBA [Small Business Administration], went down, wrote out this little two-page thing that they kept sending me back and saying: nope, you didn't do your paperwork right, nope.  And I didn't know what paperwork.  I figured, give me the forms and I would go back.  And after doing this, it was--I asked for the least that I--that they--I felt they would give me.  And this lady that worked at the bank called me with a very secret call.  She was a black lady, Patricia, Patricia Williams.  And she says I've seen you keep coming back with that paperwork.  She says keep coming back.  She says they're giving all the money to cu--to Cubans.  Blacks get so frustrated after one visit they don't come back 'cause they don't intend to give it to you.  But you've been coming back more than anybody that I've seen.  Keep coming back.  And I said well, can I talk to you?  She says no, they--you've been assigned to this guy.  And, and I did, and I made--got some of my cards printed, see, and had an address put on it.  So my last visit, and although I didn't have a space 'cause I didn't have the money, I said I got my card (laughter).  And they said well, I see you're determined, so they, they gave me the kiss of death money, $6,000 was to fail.  And I, I could have very easily, because within two weeks the money was gone.  I put it all into a little storefront so I would have a sense of presence to get clients.  And it was, it was rough, because I, I, I started off with not the right amount of money.  But I started off with the right attitude, and 28 years later I'm still here.
Story_ID: 53914
Speaker 1: Now, in your business' first attempt to get on its feet, did you--what fears did you have like at that moment like, okay, I'm putting this $6,000 dollars into it.  What's the next step after that?  Did you have a process down what you were gonna do to make it succeed?
Speaker 2: I thought I did, but obviously I didn't (laughter).  I didn't have any clients.  I opened about a half a mile from where I worked, okay, but I never told anyone--you know, tried to take any of his clients.  I felt my plan was a visual plan, and I thought I had to be in a pretty prime location.  So the location of this strip stores was in a place near--called Emperary (ph.).  Emperary was the new golf community of South Florida.  It was close to Jacaranda [Golf Club], which the--these private homes were being built--yuppies--so I felt I had an opportunity for them to pass by and see my little storefront and hire me; knew I couldn't be at home trying to do it.  You know, like many of us, we feel that we could do it out of our house.  And you gotta bite the bullet.  You gotta, you gotta move forward so people will know that you're there.  So my plan of action was visual, built--I had a showcase where there were custom designed furniture items, chairs, sofa, and a table that was in this 10x10 vignette window.  Behind me was another about a hundred--two hundred square feet where I had my desk and this small drawing board, and it worked.  And I was there from about 9:00 to about 10:00 every night.  So you could see me working in there, and they had a theater that was on the same grounds.  And next door to me was the ice cream parlor, so people would walk by.  I have people call me today, now that they see so many nat--national articles--and they're all white because I was in a white neighborhood--and said you don't know who I am, but I knew you were gonna make it 'cause I saw what you were doing, sitting in that window drawing.  One lady called me just a month ago.  She's in California.  The last article that came out in "Digest," she said I bought one of the chairs that was in your vignette window.  And I have moved several times, and the only piece that I've kept was that chair.  So, the little things you think you're doing that you don't know what you're doing, you know what you're doing, you just don't know that you're doing 'em (laughter).
Story_ID: 53915
Speaker 1: Okay, now you're in, you've opened your store, gotten your loan to open your designer store.  You're in an area that's populated not by African Americans but by Caucasians.  Did you believe in your mind that Caucasians would come and patronize your store?
Speaker 2: I obviously did right (laughter); I think so.  I, I'm sure I did.  I, I, I probably knew I had no other choice.  By this point I conquered the racial barrier in, in several areas now.  So I had a little bit of practice at it from teaching in Waycross, Georgia--Alma, Georgia, now going to the Art Institute [The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale, Florida], and now this is maybe the last frontier.  So I, I realized that I, I could handle that part of it.  What I was looking at is that I didn't know anything else.  I didn't realize what the field it took for people to make it in this field.  Now I will tell you this, that the field of interior designing is difficult regardless of whether you're black, white, or whatever.  It's not many people that stay in this field that actually went to school for it because you have to have connections; you have to have perseverance.  It's, it's just not an easy field, so there you go.  So you add that on top of the fact that I'm black.  It was difficult.  I did what I had to do.  I had many months that I didn't know how I was to pay the rent.  Obviously I was not paying myself.  I was still staying at home with my parents.  I'd not gotten myself in debt that I had demands that made me pull away from my, my dream.  I--so I kept my lifestyle very modest, put all the money that I made back into the company.  I didn't sit there, by the way, just saying oh, woe is me.  If people did not come in for me to do as much as a throw pillow, I went out to find work.  I could still draw, and one of the areas of interior designing that most interior designers cannot do is draw.  They can't render.  Rendering is doing an artistic concept of a room, showing the chairs, the arrangements to make you feel that you can actually walk into the room.  So I, I, I went to a district that had a lot of interior designers called Las Olas, went into their storefronts and said I do renderings.  Would you hire me to do a rendering?  And many of them did.  So I made the rent on many months by doing work for other interior designers who I have in my own storefront.  And, and this is the way I kept going, whatever I had to do.  I, I did paintings on the side, okay, and sold them to people.  And, and you know, I, I just made it happen.  I didn't make myself go out of business by saying this is what I do.
Speaker 1: So to maintain your dream you did side jobs?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, very much so.
Speaker 1: But all, all connected to the artistic--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: All connected to the artistic, exactly.  Why go past what you're already doing, and plus I wanted to be around at the facility in which I was renting.  So I wasn't trying to get work that I had to go and do work within someone else's establishment.  I had to stay there so when people did come into seek my services that I was there.  So the drawings that I was doing for other designers I could truly do it right in my own space and, and take care of it that way.
Story_ID: 53916
Speaker 1: Do you remember the moment when you had your first client that wanted you to do significant work?
Speaker 2: I remember it like it was yesterday when I had the first client.  This lady walks in, much younger than me or maybe about the same age.  I would say--back then what was I--29, somewhere in there?  And Holly--I can't remember her last name right now.  It's a funny name.  She was building a house in this prestigious area, Jacaranda [Golf Club].  Now to me, Jacaranda, if I gotta drive in there, was like getting to the--getting to "Architectural Digest."  It's, it was just that amazing because it had a well-known name for being an exclusive area of homes.  She was building a 45,000 square feet.  Can--that was huge back then.  She and her husband had two children.  And you know, Holly was looking for--she, she could see the talent, but they were very cheap.  They were looking for someone that they could get for almost nothing, and ba-da, there I am!  So her plan was to get all she could get from me at a very good price, okay, she and her husband.  And my plan was to get all I could get from them and possibly get published.  So here we are I quoted one price 'cause I was--because I was working on a fee, and they kicked--brought it down to another.  So the job for $4500--45,000 square feet--I'm sorry--45,000 square feet included working with the ground--the house from the ground up.  The house was being de--designed by the architect.  I was to do the space planning, select every interior item, including the door knobs, toilets, faucets, okay, that go in--into the space; to do the decorating; to order, and to supervise, and to make sure it was all installed.  My unbelievable fee was $1400, which took a total of eight and a half months to do the project from start to finish; so there.  And I started off telling them 16.  They talked me down to 14.  I took the 14.  I--and the job was good because I was exposed to all that I was supposed to be.  Most people think interior designers do furnishing.  I was a space planner.  I designed furniture; I space plan; I do all of that.  That's my primary job, to put the furniture, pew, could do that in no time.  So Holly understood this.  So I, I supervised and changed the architectural drawing and came up with the first contemporary home with a Lucite round shower, with a (unclear) with the sort of huge Roman tub around it.  Everything was rounded and curved.  I had to have the Lucite curve--the Lucite is a material that act as a shower door.  I had to have that specially made to accept this curved shower.  So a lot of things I did for them, because I took it from the ground up, I was able to do that had not been done before.  What I wanted I got.  The house was published in 1975.  It was the first publication that I was in.  It was published in the "Miami Herald," a two-page full color spread.  This was only within a year after I'd opened my doors, so I, I, I took--got nothing in reference to what I was paid.  And she was--they were a very difficult client too.  They still wanted more and more and more, but I got what I went for.  I wanted to make the house spectacular, and they were willing to use me to make that happen.  So we all kind of got what we wanted
Story_ID: 53917
Speaker 1: Now what were the benefits that were reaped from this?  What happened after the full-page ad in "Miami Herald?"
Speaker 2: Well, what happened, it was a couple of things happened.  First of all, before the ad I learned something that I had to learn, that I had to learn to--that my work had to be photographed; it had to be documented.  It wasn't good enough that I could tell people I did someone's home.  Well, I can't take other people in someone's home like it's my home to view their home.  So I learned that I had to document it with photographs.  So I, I hired a photographer that was very good to document my work.  From that photograph, I said wow, this is great; what do I do next?  And I realized I had to take it to someone so they could make it--validate it by printing it.  So I went to the "Miami Herald."  And we didn't have as many local magazines of interior designing as we do now.  So I went down to "Miami Herald," and same story, oh, you don't have an appointment, went several times, waited downstairs to meet this author of "Lifestyle," who was there for much of 30-something years, Joanne Warney (ph.).  And finally, waiting it out, they allowed me to take the photographs to her.  And she says this is good; this is good; we want this; we want this, but we cannot use your photographs because they--it's some type of printer's right.  We would have to send our photographer back and photograph it.  I says fine.  So I learned the, the, the, the power of, of seeing yourself in print, your work.  And I had no idea that they were to do two full pages, but I knew it was coming out.  So Sunday--and Sunday--Sunday there's more readers on Sunday than any other day it came out.  And I saw a two-page spread, and I was ecstatic.  I was ecstatic.  It, it was the beginning of a life of publications for me.  It will never, ever stop.  I saw the important--but the, the real, real funny part is that I, I'm still in an office with one, which is myself.  And I went oh my God, what am I gonna do?  The phone is gonna be ringing off the hook.  I'm gonna have to get in early to answer the phone calls.  Everyone is--will want to hire me.  It's--how many people, the circulation?  I get in two hours early, get myself organized, and sit by the phone--hour, not a ring; two hours (laughter), no ring.  Needless to say, the phone never rung.  As I went through the process, people that's in my field was congratulating me and telling me how wonderful.  The, the, the moral of the story is that publication simply give you recognition.  They do not necessarily give you jobs.  It gives you credibility, and I learned that.  But it's still is, is, is worth having it done.

Speaker 1: So after that point of the name recognition among your colleagues, what were your next steps in like I need to get the clientele, and now I have at least documented proof of my talents and abilities to show them?
Speaker 2: It opened up a, a, a courage for me.  I, I was--now I got involved in the interior designing guild, okay.  I, I walked--at, at the time South Florida, our design center was four or five streets.  We didn't have a tall building, and we called it 40th Street.  Oh, it was a parade of such, the decorators of finest and the clients with the big diamonds.  The decorators wore their straw hats with their briefcase, and the guys wore their linen suits.  And they just stroll up and down the Boulevard at ease.  Don't forget, most of these interior designs were wealthy, so they didn't have to work.  Now show up me, who needs to work for a living, running through the streets trying to pick and select things.  They didn't know what I was about.  First of all, I've gotten these stories later on.  Obviously they didn't have the nerve to tell me then.  But when I just received an award recently, it was sort of a testimony from people that I knew 28 years ago.  And the testimony was that when you came down to that street, and we saw you walking about, we went what is this, and why is--you know, what am I doing there.  And I knew that I wasn't, you know, being with open arms, but they couldn't do anything about it.  Then the guy says to me, and later on you blew us totally out the water because you show up with these Jewish clients, and you were telling them what they should do--no, you don't want this; you want that; no, this'll look better for your home.  So it was as if I was giving--I was in control, more so than many of the white designers, you see.  So their story of me is more interesting than my story of myself, because I was just doing what I had to do.  And how they saw me was--back then was a, a history maker, a legend, if you will.  I just saw myself as a struggling artist trying to make each day (laughter) and, and, and, and make sure that I could pay my bills.
Story_ID: 53919
Speaker 1: So were the majority of your early clientele Jewish individuals?
Speaker 2: All of my clients was Jewish individuals.  I did not get my first black client until Wesley Snipes.
Speaker 1: Now how did you think that came about that many Jewish individuals came to patronize your business?
Speaker 2: I was in a Jewish neighborhood.  That's number one.  And maybe they have a more open mind to blacks.  Maybe I'm--I, I, I would think so, maybe not.  I think Jewish people recognize that black people have talent.  And if you ask me what I really think I think they think of me, they know I'm gonna do more than they probably ever paid me for.  It's not that I'm trying to prove anything.  It's just the way we are.  And sometime other people are a dif--different way.  They, they want more than what (laughter) they're paying for.  But I've had a beautiful relationship.  They've been very fair.  I demanded a lot of them.  They dada--have demanded a lot of me.  And I think that they came to me originally because I was there, because I was priced right, because I had talent, and they come to me now because of my reputation, and they've heard about me.  I do not advertise, never had.  It's a word of mouth industry.
Story_ID: 53920
Speaker 1: Now "Architectural Digest," the--is one of the books of your, your field.  Had you noticed that in this book that African American interior designers, even if they existed, were never in there or never been sought after to be placed in there?
Speaker 2: I hadn't made a point of, you know, doing any research on it, but I, I--my commonsense told me that no other African American had been there at--for most of my career.  I know that most African Americans are not in this field, and I know where I am in this field compared to most.  So it didn't really ask--I didn't ask of myself that question.  When I--we were published in the book, I had started to not worry about ever going into "Architectural Digest--let me just share that with you--which is true of many of my ca--counter co-parts in interior designing.  Most of us know you will never get published in that book; it's very rare and in between.  The book has a selection of a few that graced those pages, and the ones that get in new are very few and in between, okay.  The, the editor has been around for 30-some odd years, and most of the people that you're seeing published in there have been around, being published in that book for 20-odd--some odd years.  Then it changed at most of the thing was focusing on celebrities.  So I didn't think about it.  When we finished, completed Wesley's home, the photographer that I've used for 20 years photographed for "Architectural Digest," which I didn't realize that he'd photographed in South Florida and the Caribbean.  And I showed him the home.  He says wait.  He didn't know whose home--he said this is magnificent.  I may can do something for you because I normally pay about $7,000 per photo shoot, okay, for one house.  And he said I'll--let me see, so he called "Digest."  They asked him to scout it.  He scouted it, sent them the shots, and they said yeah, we want this home.  And we photographed it, and that's how it happened.  That's how it got in.  So when I got the call, because they can very well scout a job, pay for the scout, and still will not accept.  And they will not accept it just because you're a celebrity.  A lot of people think that--what, what's his name?  The Rocky guy--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --the box-[Sylvester] Stallone.  He tried for many years and finally got in, but they--it's not about--it has to be of a certain quality.  So when I finally got in, you get jaded, you know.  You get so many bruises, by the time you get the punch that knock you out, you're already knocked out (laughter).  So I, I was happy, but did I start treating my life any different?  No, it was just another step, and it happened.
Story_ID: 53921
Speaker 1: Your career is starting--it's picking up, and your clientele is all non-African American.  At any point during the success did you ever yourself or think, why have any African Americans come or attempted to come my way?
Speaker 2: No, not really, no, because I--most of the people I knew of African American lived here.  I'd not branched out to places like Chicago [Illinois] where you had more affluent African Americans.  We have affluent African Americans throughout the world, throughout the country.  My circle in Broward and Dade County [Florida] didn't show me any of those (laughter) people.  So--and I, and I have a lot of friends, beautiful friends, enjoy them to the most.  But most people, when I was in, in circles of African Americans, I wouldn't tell them I was an interior designer.  I wouldn't reveal that to them, because I didn't want them to say something to me like, oh, I need someone to do my drapes (laughter); or I have this sofa I need to have reupholstered; or I need someone to do one room for me; or I need someone to give me advice.  And the reason they would do that 'cause they had no clue about what I really did.  And I chose not to try to--once I talked to a few people and I had to tell them how we work, African Americans, they became insulted.  They thought I was trying to be big stuff.  So we really didn't seek it out.  We really didn't seek it out because we weren't aware of various areas that had so many affluent blacks.  Because back in the '60's [1960s]--not the '60's [1960s]--in the '70's [1970s] and the early '80's [1980s] we weren't as global as we are now.  We were pretty much more territorial.  So territorially speaking, I did not know anyone to solicit for our type of work, you know, to try to get them to become our client.
Story_ID: 53922
Speaker 1: Wesley's [Wesley Snipes] house was in Orlando, Florida, okay.  And Wesley then--we started to have people to see our work nationally, because dark--"Architectural Digest" is a national magazine.  I got a call from this gentleman in Africa that wanted us to do work, and I was like, gulp, and he, he, he, he felt the pain through the phone.  And he said Cecil, you have to realize the world is very global now.  They do have planes and trains and (laughter)--so, I, I had to realize that my world was easy to work from here to New York, okay, so we started to do that.  We started to do work throughout the country.  And by doing that, people like Samuel L. Jackson, who was in California, we did work for him there, okay.  We did Penny Hardaway house in Tennessee, and we found that it was easy.  We make it all here in our factory, pack it on the truck, ship it out.  My staff of decorators and designers come out to set it up by plane a few days later.  So once we became global it was easy.  Now what also happened is that we had more affluent blacks that are coming to South Florida for a second or third home.  Our jobs are--my jobs consist of not your main house; my jobs mostly consist of one of your other homes or one--if it is the main house.  But I don't have not one client that has only one house.  You see what I'm saying?  So you really are looking at a very special type of person to be able to afford that type of lifestyle.
Story_ID: 53923
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Mr. Snipes [Wesley Snipes].  That call comes where you're contacted.  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: The old fashion way.  I met his mother (laughter).  It's, it's--and we will be here all day telling the entire story so I'll make it short.  The important part of the story is that I met Wesley's mother through the realtor that sold Wesley the home in Orlando [Florida].  And I--when I met her I met her as a friend, and I never tried to seek out to know her son.  As things would have it, I had an affair here, and I invited the realtor to come to the affair and stay at our home.  And she said well, Marian said she wants to come.  That's Wesley's mother.  So I said fine, bring her.  So she came and she stayed in my--our home and was in awe over the look of the house.  She was in the process herself of, of Wesley building her a beautiful home on Orlando, and she was having a lot of problems.  And I was telling her, you know, different things she should do.  Well, Wesley had another interior designer that was doing the house that I did in Orland and doing a home for him in New York.  So my girlfriend, the realtor, kept saying, why don't you get Marian to talk, have Wesley to, to, to have her to tell, tell her--Wesley about you.  I says no, no, no, I'm not going to do that, and I didn't.  So she--the house was finished in California.  Wesley's home had been decorated and completed in California.  His mother went there to visit him.  And when she went there, she called me back and a scream over the phone of how awful the place looked, how terrible it looked.  And compared to my house what this person had done to her baby's home was terrible.  And she kept saying to him you need to meet this lady, and he finally gave up to his mother's need just to get her to stop talking.  And she said send something quick.  Send photographs, send whatever, send this and that.  And we had brochures, so we sent it.  And here's the way she said when she called me the next day, after she got the package and had dinner, and she said, I'm not supposed to be calling you, but I can't help it--say we're sitting at dinner.  I don't say a word.  All of a sudden Wesley hits his hand on the, on the, on the table with his fist and said, "Ma, these people are awesome; I gotta call 'em."  And we got in the door through, through Mrs. Marian Snipes (laughter).
Story_ID: 53924
Speaker 1: Now the type of art--I'm sorry--the type of interior decorating that he [Wesley Snipes] wanted, that also opened up a different avenue, didn't it?
Speaker 2: In reference to--
Speaker 1: To whatever style he desired.
Speaker 2: Well, no, not really, no.  I mean I do okay, and it did not for the reason that interior designing, if you're really an interior designer, it speaks to whatever you like and you direct.  So for me, my home is similar--had some strength for Wesley [Snipes] because we're from the same culture, you see, so I was doing that already.  And then south--we used to do really great looking Southwestern that had a flavor of the spirit of Africa, you know.  So Southwestern was big, and we were doing that.  You just take the Indians out, and put the Africans in (laughter), since it, it's a little bit of a difference there.  The--but Wesley, I would like for people to think that he had a lot of input, but he didn't.  I met with Wesley four times in, in, in--we was off to make to--a movie.  He gave me some insight of what he wanted.  Most certainly I knew because he told me he wanted to have African influences in there; he like symbolic things, and he liked the strength of that.  So we now made it into a home.  And we bring everything to our clients.  Our clients usually do not shop with us, so Wesley didn't have to shop.  I bring everything to my clients.  I bring them the vision, you see.  So my attitude about my design work and with Wesley and everyone else, and this is when you do good work, is the house speaks to me.  You echo in the background, but the house is what speaks to me.  I needed to know how to fit the house as well as I need to know how to fit you in a suit, because a house is the shape.  And the ha--and the shape controls what the house will accept.  Now you bought the house; I didn't, so obviously you want me to consider making this a great composition with what I put in this shape.  So he told me his vision, his look, and we ran with it.  What Wesley did do that I enjoyed was he wasn't around, and he gave us full trust.  So as an artist you can paint better if someone isn't looking over your shoulder, don't you think?  So we, we, we, we're more creative when someone is allowing you to sing your song and put the melodies in there that you want, and you know what note to hit.  And, and that becomes your creative process.  I enjoyed it because it did give me, give me an opportunity to use more African artifacts than I've ever used, okay.  I did it for Penny Hardaway before I did it for Wesley.  The only difference is, is that Penny was a kid from the--from--just from the hood, knew nothing about any African art.  So we, we brought it in because we wanted him to know it, and he accepted the learning process; Wesley knew.  But it was enjoyable; it was fun; and it was certainly the best time I had with mixed media and just playing around and, and, and making it an art form.
Story_ID: 53925
Speaker 1: I wanna get back to Wesley [Snipes], but with your African art and artifacts, have you ever used those with some of your--the Jewish and white clientele that--
Speaker 2: Back in '78' [1978], African artifacts was just as hot as Volvos may have been, but--and it was a, it was a thing; it was a fad; it was a trend.  And they--that was when Africa got robbed in '75' [1975]--about '75' [1975], '78' [1978]--of all of its authentic pieces, and I saw them.  I saw them because they were in the stores and the design center.  And the people that purchased those pieces purchased them simply because it was a look.  So, yes, we, did use 'em, but now I, I, I, I--they will probably--they don't accept them as well because it's not the look.  If it was the look it would be in.  If you look in "Architectural Digest," they're used many times as accents, okay.  And it has to come in, in a big way to use it in a degree that will count--in an amount that would count.
Story_ID: 53926
Speaker 1: So now after the Wesley Snipes home, did you field more calls from African Americans of notoriety who wanted you to work with them?
Speaker 2: I actually met Samuel Jackson because of Wesley.  I met his wife, LaTanya Jackson.  I was in Chicago [Illinois] with friends of mine, the Dickens, Jacoby Dickens [HM], and LaTanya Jackson was shooting the movie with Wesley called "The Fugitive" or something like that, and she was the deputy.  And when I was with Jacoby, I--I went there for an "Ebony" article that they were doing on Wesley and myself.  And Jacoby took us out to dinner, and he says oh, you know, Wesley is shooting in town.  I said yeah, I heard.  We just talked to his people the other day.  And he said in a--LaTanya Jackson, who is a friend of one of my friends, is here, you know, and--because she's shooting.  I said oh, really?  And he says we're going to this art gallery tomorrow, and she's an art lover, and maybe you wanna come.  I said oh, fine; you know, I would love to do that.  So when I walked in the door of the art gallery, LaTanya was at the back of the, the gallery and came out with this loud scream.  And she was clutching this magazine to her chest, going: "Oh my God, I can't believe it's you."  And she was speaking of me.  Now I'm like, on the other hand, looking around to see who she's talking about.  And it was ecstatic to meet her, and right away we became friends.  We played cards, bid whist.  See, good thing I learned bid whist at the A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] (laughter) Universe--University.  So we played bid whist that night until, oh, I don't know what time it was, but I had a great time.  She invited me to, to California, which I eventually did go to see her and met Sam.  So I did meet--through Wesley I met them.  And through LaTanya and Sam I met many people, because they had a luncheon.  And let me show you how African American--
Story_ID: 53927
Speaker 1: Before you were speaking how when you met Mr. and Mrs. Jackson, that that took you too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, they planned a luncheon.  I was explaining how it feels so very much close to, to blackness, and, and I really do.  There's nothing I love more in the world than black people.  And I really want everyone else to love 'em too--want, want us to love each other first.  But I mention them because it takes away some of those things that people say about--we say about each other, how we don't try to help each other.  We're like crabs in a bucket.  We say these things.  And the Jacksons had this luncheon, and they said to me oh, when you're there--here--we'll, we'll have a luncheon for you.  I had not, I had not met Sam [Samuel L. Jackson], and the trip was arranged around the time that Sam would be in time--town.  This is by LaTanya's [LaTanya Richardson Jackson] doing, Sam's wife.  So when we got to the house it was Shea, my niece, who's my office manager; Michael, my marketing director, and who's also my nephew; and my husband, [Arzell] Powell, and, and Cecil.  These are the people that went to California.  We actually went there on another mission as well.  This is part of it.  And so we went.  And the secretary comes out and says they're upstairs getting dressed, the Jacksons, but she wanted you to see her guest list.  And the guest list was like oh my God, did I wear the right clothes.  It was Denzel [Washington] and Pauletta [Washington], Sidney Poitier.  The list just went on and on.  And they--she literally invited them there to meet us, to meet me, and that was such an honor, and it was such a wonderful thing for another human being to do for someone else.  So we, we were treated very royally when we were in California.  But I have met others.  I've--now I'm getting to the point that it's just celebrities.  I'm, I'm like in love because we're meeting these black entrepreneurs such as Jacoby Dickens [HM], and he connected us with the Chicago group--loved Chicago [Illinois].  I was--went to Chicago on the occasion when I told you I met LaTanya.  That was my first time.  And Jacoby became our guide who, he's been in Chicago for I guess 45 years.  He owns a bank there, and he knows everyone.  He showed us around.  Well, this was the first time in my entire life that I've seen blacks that were so successful.  And they could stay in a neighborhood and still have a neighborhood that was prestigious.  Here that's unheard of.  We all had to move from where we were and just sort of mix in that we would have this type of community.  So I was in awe with, with Chicago.  And, and I was--it was so rewarding, and I was so grateful to see it because you become negative and stagnant if you stay in one place.  You start thinking that the whole world is like that.  And particularly this is important for black people, because we have to get out and find and seek the truth rather than except what's been, you know, told to us.
Story_ID: 53928
Speaker 1: Now I wanna definitely ask you how the opportunity with the African-American Research Library [African-American Research Library and Cultural Center, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] came up since commercial is not an area that you do often.  Then how did--how did you become involved in that?
Speaker 2: Because I asked (laughter).  I did a real simple thing.  I, I, I saw--I read about it in the newspaper.  And I said to Michael, who's my marketing person, I says how could this be?  How could they be in the planning, drawing period to build something in the black community in Fort Lauderdale [Florida], and I don't know anything about it.  And I knew Sam [Morrison], not, you know, well, but I knew, knew him and he knew me.  And, and I wasn't so interested in whether I get to be a designer on it.  I wanted to be involved in it.  Now I'm at the stage in my life that I, I, I know I'm here for other purposes, okay.  I'm, I'm at that stage.  So this was to me a part of that, recognizing that I need to be involved.  So we called Michael Call (ph.) on my behalf.  And the director of the library, which is Sam Morrison, who's an African American, said, "Cecil, she's interested?  She wants to be involved?  Sure, let's get together; let's have lunch."  And he said to me, "How much do you want to be involved."  And I said how much do you want me to?  It turned out that the involvement that he needed was not a volunteer, because I couldn't do that much work as volunteer.  So he wrote to the county and was able to write my name in as the interior designer.  Now this is unheard of because no library hires an interior designer like myself.  It is a library.  The county is paying for a library.  So I got involved because of, because of Sam, because I wanted to be involved.  And we came in at a very modest fee so we could be involved.
Story_ID: 53929
Speaker 1: Now since your focus is usually homes, and this is a library for specific academic research and things of that sort, how does your focus shift or change in any way in the process?
Speaker 2: Well, you just order a hundred chairs rather than one (laughter).  The focus change in volume.  It, it, it's--commercial is much easier than residential, let me just clear that up--unless you're doing institutional like hospitals or something of that nature.  But when you're dealing with study halls, libraries, it's a lot easier to do that than, than residential.  So my focus just changed on the function of the space.  I really was brought aboard, and, and Sam [Morrison] wanted me so, so much to be a part of this project, because the building was starting to not have any African motif in its design.  And he really could not do anything about that, because he's the director of the library.  But the county commissioners are the ones that hired the--voted on the architectural firm and all of the powers to be to make this building happen.  And he was very implement--he actually was able to get me in to save the building in reference to the interior appearance of it.  So this is how the, the ball was rolling. Some things I did not know.
Story_ID: 53930
Speaker 1: The other part of the building that's very, very much a part of the way I feel about it is I did not realize that they--this county was not giving the library director, who actually worked to make this project happen, Sam Morrison, the, the budget to, to build the type of building we have.  They gave him a, a small sum of money, $5 million and said go raise the rest of the money.  And the community of Broward County [Florida], the African-American community and some whites--but as far as the foot soldiers, okay, not the guys with the big butt--the foot soldiers that made this thing happen came from Broward County, from a dollar here to a hundred dollars.  And this is probably a county project, a first of its kind where the community has paid for it, 'cause the building is twice as much as what the county gave.  We didn't see--I could not be a foot soldier, okay.  I didn't have the time to go from door to door and knocking and asking for donations.  I just didn't have the time to do that.  But coming up to our 25th anniversary, Michael Orgell (ph.), our marketing manager, said to me what are we going to do?  I says nothing.  We just live through it.  And like I do, I really meditate over things, and I wait for messages to come to me.  And it was that you need to do something.  You're very blessed to have arrived this far in your life.  And I thought about the connections that I'd had with Sam--Samuel Jackson, with the other people, and I decided to make our 25th a fundraiser.
Story_ID: 53931
Speaker 1: So I went back to all of the people that have given me achievements, and awards, and accolades and asked them to be a part of this, and they did.  And the, the, the Design Center gave us the building to have the fundraiser.  Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] was the music people that had the band.  The Art Institute [The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] has a culinary--I never say this right.  It's a chef school of cooking (laughter), culinary I think.  They donated all of their chefs to do all of the food, okay, and we were off and running.  And Samuel Jackson and Tyra Banks agreed to come as the celebrities.  Well, Broward County, the--we were doing something that had never been done in this area, is giving a celebrity fundraiser sponsored by us as a company.  We did have tickets for a $155, including dinner, And we were very successful.  And we gave all of the funds back to the library [African-American Research Library and Cultural Center, Fort Lauderdale, Florida].  We raised over a $125,000 that night.  And it was my first time ever, ever doing anything like this, but it felt good.  It was for the right reasons, and we got a tremendous national press for the library.
Speaker 2: And now it's off and running.
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.
Story_ID: 53932
Speaker 1: Now, in the area back to actually the processes and the--of interior design, from start to finish when it's brought to you, what is the process you go through to do your interior designing in someone with someone's home?
Speaker 2: From start to finish?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Obviously I, I, I meet with the people.  I actually try to understand who they are, what they want, but I'm very observant.  I could do your home probably, and you could come back just from this one meeting.  People want the same thing.  They want a chair; they want a chair; they want sofa; they want a dining table; they want the functional parts.  It's just the look that changes, you see.  And so I get the look that they're looking for.  I sort of look them up and down without them noticing (laughter).  That gives me a feeling for the people I'm dealing with, which is fine.  Everyone is different.  Then I visit the space, and I usually try to do that more than once.  With that--with the people not being there not being there helps me a lot because as I, I--the spake--space--will speak to me.  It'll tell me what it needs.  I do all of my work from a drawing board.  I'm, I, I--from a drafting board, then to a drawing board of rendering.  From my inner feelings it must come out on paper what I'm seeing.  So when the people come in, once they've given the initial project, we have--it's set up on--in frames, your whole vision of you room.  We, we, we draw it, and we frame it, and--like you would hang on the way, a frame on the way.  And it's on easels, so every room, main rooms, are there for you to look at.  We're not asking you to look at--what, what do you think of this chair?  What do you think of this table?  What do you think of this fabric?  That's not our style.  I don't want you to like that table.  I don't want you to love one piece of furniture in your home.  Because if you love and someone comes in and say wow, that's a gorgeous chair, it must be something wrong with the rest of it because you're supposed to see composition first, you see.  So we, we get our clients to understand that it's the composition.  If you walked in a room, easily understood, and you had on the best suit in the world, the best tie in the world, and the best shirt, all of it goes together.  And the first thing they say when they walk up to you is what a gorgeous tie.  You did something wrong.  The tie wasn't supposed to take over (laughter). So it, it's--so we don't want our clients to see one piece.  We show them the entire room with all of its ambience and let them fall in love with that or either then start picking apart - I don't like this chair.  Fine, no problem, as long as we find something in the right scale that fit what we had.  They love it because we're, we're educating them, you see.  The--you love people; you don't love furniture, for God's sake (laughter).

Speaker 1: So now once we finish for the black and white, then we'd allow ourselves to select colors and fabrics.  I do not select fabrics and colors until we finish all of the drawings very simply because colors and textures have weights, has a weight to it.  So once I finish drawing on, on the canvas, if you like red and you really like it, I know I can't paint eight--ten-foot sofa red because it's gonna take over the room, but maybe a throw pillow.  So the colors for me go in after that; the fabrics go in.  And we never bring you one piece.  We bring you a composition for the room, but we bring you more than one composition, a pallet composition so you can make intelligent decision.  We--we're, we're, we're--we--once you've done--that's completed, and we have arrived at your colors--and you give me your colors.  Whatever color you like, I like.  It's not such thing as me hating a color.  Color never did anything to me.  I don't like certain combination and, and coordination of color used together, but color is--whatever color you like, fine.  I just have to get the color distribution correct.  So now that we've gotten that straight and we've gotten--and, and from (unclear)--if I'm doing construction, and we do construction too--we take houses from the ground up--then what I've said is, it's more to it than that.  But this is strictly for interior designing, you know, decorative pieces.  We design most of our pieces.  I'll tell you a little bit about that because it started from--when I first started out, I did not want to be intimidated on that street where we were shopping by white stores owners that wanna know why am I here; why am I with these people.  So came back to my drawing board, and I started to draw furniture rather than going to show them furniture.  Then I would bring my clients in here where I had complete control of making them understand who I was rather than taking them on the Boulevard where other people were distracting them away from me.  So what I started off doing to control and to protect my, my own image of myself turned out to be the best thing that I could have ever done.  Now I'm known as a custom interior designer.  I was able to open up a second part of our company that my husband joined [Arzell Powell], which is manufacturing, through that thought pra--through that process, you see.  So if we, if we have custom pieces, the next step is that we design those custom pieces for them.  Our clients don't sit on these things; they don't see anything; they don't touch anything.  They just trust me, and my trust is based on reputation.  You know, that's, that's a simply as I can put it.  When we have now selected all of the items, we create a budget of all of those items.  So before our clients decide on any of the above items, we do a, a total list of all of them because you can't order--you have to do the entire house with us.  We're not a one room, one item person.  So we want you to commit to this budget of the things that we have now told you with the exception of the art and the decorative.  We, we, we have a fee for starting the job when you hire us that you--it takes care of all the drawings.  And we have a commission in each item that we sell.  But the thing of it is, is that they then sign most--in most cases everything is crystal clear.  They give us a check; we order; then they go away.  And the process for us is that most of our clients leave South Florida within the month of April and May.  They are now going back where they came from, the North.  So we are hired to do their homes from soup to nuts during the summertime, because they return between October, and November, and December.  So we take on pretty much 12--between 10-15 jobs a year according to the size, and we have to completely take care of them.  When they walk in the door--we tell them when to come.  We orchestrate all of our jobs according to the numbers, and we'll call them and say on this date in October are you gonna be available to come view your home complete?  So when they walk in the door, they walk in the door to everything.  The beds are made, the linen is on, fresh flowers, candles are burning, and all of the items that they've ordered through us.  So they, they walk in as a bride.  And that's our vision, that you walk in to a finished space, and you see it in all of its glamour and splendor.

Speaker 1: Now, I guess what impresses me most is you had to find your way a great deal in this business on your own without mentors.  Now, have you sought out or have you come across young African Americans who desire to be interior decorators who contacted you to assist them or in any way?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I have.  And we get calls all the time, and we've asked to be mentors.  We try to write back.  We try to call back.  I can't call 'em all back, but I try to make sure someone from our office, my office manager, Shea, or either Michael will speak with them, but all the time, all the time, all the time.  And I didn't have anyone that I could talk to, and I didn't have any of that.  I mean I made my own rules.  Now some of my rules people are copying now.  Because we're also known that the way we--when our clients come to us--remember, most of the time we're not their first experience with an interior designer.  They've used other interior designers.  And they have come to us because they heard about the way that we operation, which means, which let me know now that most interior designers are not operating like myself, and I'm speaking of hundreds and hundreds of them, that they under--the way we do it all is so professional.  It's so organized, and that's what we heard all the time.  That's our reputation now.  So it's not just for African Americans as a mentor.  It's, it's also for, for white Americans.  What I will say to you, and I just did this recently, a young lady called.  And this is gone--many people have called, but something just came over me this particular day.  And she was asking the same question.  I'm running into these stumbling blocks.  I think--this is what I wanna do with my life, but I need to know if I can--should do this.  I need help.  Can you give advice?  Can you do this?  Can you do the other?  And it--I--it's something that said tell the truth.  Don't sweeten it up.  And I said listen: first of all, don't call and ask people--(laughter).  I said do you know if I had called and asked anyone how to find my dream, I wouldn't have ever done it.  Because if they had told me what I know now, you know, I proba--probably would have just forgotten about it.  But by the mere fact that I didn't know, it didn't give me anything to hold onto.  You understand?  And I said to her, I said so I can't tell you it's gonna happen for you the way it's gonna--it happened for me.  I can't because this is an art field.  You can't--you don't know which singer is gonna make it.  I mean it certainly isn't because one sing better than the other.  Some of them sound terrible, and they got the best (laughter) contracts.  So my, my thing to, to people that call me now is gonna be the truth.  And the truth is you have to have a passion.  And if you're looking for an advice of whether you should do something, or whether you shouldn't do it, or what the field is like, you shouldn't do that because what it's like today doesn't mean it's gonna be like that tomorrow.  Where, where--South Florida was the best place I could have become an interior designer.  But 10 years before that it would have been the worst place for me to be an interior designer.  You understand?  Because what has happened here in the last 20 years happened right after I decided to become an interior designer.  It wasn't a Boca Raton 20 years ago.  My, my uncle owned property in Boca Raton that he paid $10 an acre for land.  You can't get a lot for $100,000 over there now.  You see what I'm saying?  So it, it evolves, and it's different, so you must find your right place.  And if it's mean for you, try not to get too many answers because most of us are gonna tell you the bad as well as the good.  And we like the bad stories more than we like the good ones (laughter).  And that may not be a great thing to, to mentor to people because they may not try it.

Speaker 1: Now some 28 years later, do you see that there are more?  Do you see more or come across more African-American interior designers than there were when you--or that you knew of that--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, there's more of them, but I really feel bad because there's no more opportunities.  It's more of them coming out of school.  It's very expensive too.  The Art Institute [The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale] that I attended now is about close to $20,000 a year; that's a lot of money.  Young lady that works for me in the back she's an interior designer.  She, she kept calling and calling.  She's from Tennessee--not Tennessee.  She's from Florida.  She went to school in Tennessee.  And I did not know this, but Shea told me after I hired her--she's been with me a year and a half.  She's an African American--that she is in debt of $40,000 of a loan to go in school for interior designing.  And I finally brought her in because I know.  I know, been there; still that way; it hasn't changed.  It's still this field it was.  It will all--it probably--I don't know when it will change.  It's who you know, who knows you.  It's not that much different than the sa--and being an actor.  Singing and dancing we got it made (laughter)--singing, dancing, and sports, we're there for you, and they're there for us, okay.  They, they got--'cause that's, that's the way it is.  But in the other fine arts it's very difficult.  My art form is extremely difficult, because you're getting too up close and personal as an interior designer.  It's more than buying furnishing.  I gotta know about your family.  I have to know where you keep your underwear, okay (laughter).  It, it, it's, it's a very personalized interest.  And you cannot lie because I'm in your home.  If, if you're trying to, I can hear you on the telephone.  And you have to be sociable with me.  And most important, and most important, okay, people of higher levels economically do not just hire interior designers to create a person--a beautiful home.  They hire you to create--give them status and give them a lifestyle.  Now can you imagine a very wealthy person of another race saying I, I'm hiring Cecil so she could create a lifestyle for me and give me status.  And that's what we do.  It's like wearing an Armani shirt.  It's shirt wears the same, but it's good to say it's Armani.  You know what I mean?  So when, when you have to admit that to people that have been deprived of all culture and, and richness, you're saying a helluva lot for what that inner spirit and thing that that person has on the inside that you don't know where it came from.
Story_ID: 53936
Speaker 1: Now I would like to have your definition of interior design as an art form, as an art, not from the business side, but as an art form.
Speaker 2: Well, for me it's easy because being an art major and remembering the courses that I took and relating them to the ones I took at the Art Institute [The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale].  As an art form, it, it starts off very abstract.  When I was in art school at the Art Ins--Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical Univeristy], for one solid year I took courses in design, which took--we took geometrical shapes and arranged them to make an abstract design, you know, square, rectangular.  And when it has all of the bal--balance on that sheet of paper, when it had a rhythmatic flow, okay, when it had all of the elements it became a work of art, abstract and if--but it became a work of art.  When I'm doing a floor plan that's the way I look at it because I have shapes, sofa, you know, rectangular, round table, square table, a triangle piece, or--and it doesn't have to be all the shapes, but I balance it just like I would if I was balancing those geometric shapes.  And when I loved the, the balance and the harmony of the shapes because that's one dimensional, then I bring it three dimensional to the actual rendering.  And that's the way it was for me in art.  I first had to draw it, you know, then I--after I did, you know, sort of a scale drawing, then I made a rendering and it came to life.  And I--that's why I explained to you I never painted a painting until I drew it on the canvas.  That's how I know that it's right, that you need to not select your colors first, you see.  You, you need to select the pieces first, then you need to know the weight that they color now is gonna put on it.  So I, I see it identical but just using it in a, in, in a sensible way.  It relates a hundred percent.  And the other thing I love that I like to do, I've always loved collages when I was in art school, mixing and putting stones with wood.  And it was an abstract thing, just many medias.  I love doing that in rooms.  You will never find one of my spaces that is voided of different things.  You know, this gets too boring.  And when you come into my, my office space, you'll look at these walls, and you'll never see two, two colors or the same--you'll see--and this--and well, you can't see this room.  But I think I have about four different wall coverings in here, and most people don't even notice it.  They just know it looks pleasant.  That's the secret of art.  It doesn't take over.  It is something different, but you don't know quite what it is, okay.  But that becomes art.  It doesn't become decorating.  It doesn't become za--designing.  It's learning how to use 'em to make the eye catch up to the brain eventually, but it won't happen right away.  So an artist have to learn how to use the eye first of the individual, get them captured, and maybe sooner or later the brain will catch up to what happened.

Speaker 1: I would like to ask, what are some of your hopes and dreams for the African-American community?
Speaker 2: In one answer huh--no.  Oh gosh, to realize what a sleeping giant they are; to realize that if anyone went through so much trouble, and I don't know if any other race can claim this, that somebody went through so much trouble to keep you fooled in your head, you must be something else.  You--other races they just killed.  They killed them, okay, and then that was an atrocity, but that's what happened.  But in an African American--afr--well, African American, they--everything was so plotted to fool--down to even your god, what he looks like, to keep you under control, there must be something so powerful; for us to realize that and try to wake up that giant, not so much as that we know what it is, but just by curiosity that it's gotta be something.  And I can tell you that it's there, even the little part that I've explored because here's me.  In America, to this day even more so than before, we're taught that what makes you make it in America is by doing the right things.  And if you don't do the right things, you're handicapped for life, like if you don't have the right education, if you don't get the right books, right, if you don't have the right environment, if you don't go to the right school, if you don't mingle with the right friends, if you don't have the exposure of having a mother or father or somebody's home teaching you how to read and reading to you.  If you do all of those things, you're doomed.  I was raised with all of that, and I rose above the whites that told me I couldn't do it.  I went to--I was right next to the tracks, couldn't move.  I went to Dillard [Dillard High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida]  and, and, and went to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  All of those looking back now was supposed to be inferior schools.  The first time I ever went to anything that was supposed to be an equal was the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale [Fort Lauderdale, Florida].  And all of the social graces and things that I never had and wasn't exposed to I had to catch up.  Not only did I catch up, I passed.  Where did I come from?  I believe that there's a giant that people don't--are so afraid of us.  I really truly believe that.  But I would hope that for the rest of the world, that they will get rid of the fear, and see that there is an advantage, there's something that we all bring to the table.  That, that's what I want, and I want us to see it, and I want us to do it quick.  I want us to--my hope is to first get rid of the imagery of God.  As an artist, I know that it's a tremendous detriment, because whoever is your God is who will serve.  And those photos are certainly, certainly are not what God looks like.  It's an artist, like I am, and we know how to control your mind with our art ideas.  Get rid of it.  And so tho--those are my prayers, and my hopes, and my dreams.  And if I could be a part of saying enough--I say it all the time.  People go oh, not her.

Speaker 1: The--your experiences growing up and the importance of family, especially the Bowers family, how did you translate that into your business and how your business is run here?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm sorry.  Say that again.
Speaker 1: The importance of the Bowers family, just what family has always meant to you since you were a child and even before then.  How do you translate that to how your business is run here?
Speaker 2: Well, we--family (laughter), family, family, and we, we have, we have a large selection of people here; it's not all black.  I have seven family members I will admit, but we have people from all different cultures, right.  But I think that it, it's more that I don't treat 'em like I'm the boss and it's an office space.  I miss them today because we have a big table back in the back of the office where we all break bread together, and we sit there and we have lunch together.  And we--someone set the table and make it happen, so I can't get away from just being an old family girl, and I think that's what it comes from.  But I'm--I fun have fun because we have different cultures that I learned about, which works with me and for me.

Speaker 1: (Unclear) and every artist their artwork is their signature.  And with each house or each home-even the African-American library [African-American Research Library and Cultural Center, Fort Lauderdale, Florida].  How was your signature--what do you want your signature to say on each one of those after it's--your said and done?  What do you want the signature to say?
Speaker 2: On the, the rooms--homes that we do?
Speaker 1: Homes, every job you did.
Speaker 2: Good taste.  It has a spirit within.  Our clients  vary, so sometime I can create a warmer look because they want wood and stone, and they want things that are just nature, more like a natural material.  But, you know, we have clients that want formal French, which is very--not to touch kind of look.  But I try to sneak in a, a comfy feeling with it as, as well.  So I can't get away from not making it look inviting, so I always want my rooms to look inviting like you really--it's okay to come in.  You may have to sit up straighter than you do on a leather sofa, but it's okay; come on, sit on me, and, and, and enjoy me.  So my signature is not a signature of, of a certain style, but it's a signature that I would like to think that, that offers a--have a welcoming call to it, to, to really come in and experience the room.

Speaker 1: The final question: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Oh, that she gave--well, I want my--I just wanna die tired.  I wanna--when I die I just wanna be plain old tired.  That's the legacy because I'm still working at it.  The legacy is just a legacy of what creativity really means.  And I was expressing that to you, that I could bring it to the table, that the message that I have--I've been given a message from God, and my legacy is to help pass it on.  And I--and because I know it's not easy, that I'll be like Moses and the other ones; that I was just plain old wore out (laughter), but I was still trying to scream it from the--from, from wherever I'm, I am regardless of what it is but something that's positive.  So my legacy is just beat up and, and tired but still trying to scream it out.
Speaker 1: What would you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, what do I want to be remembered for?  Somebody that gave it all she had; someone that didn't know the rules but not necessarily for one project.  I don't wanna be--I truly don't think it's about one house, one building; it's not about that.  I would like to be remembered for not, not listening to what people tell you, the rules, and being able to transfer that understanding to other people.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Thank you.

Speaker 1: This is Nolyar Bowers.  He was my great-great-great-great-uncle.  And he is the, the matriarch or he's the leader of the Bowers family reunion.  The, the photograph that you're looking at I'm not sure what year it was taken, but the year that he was born and the year that he died is at the bottom of the photograph, 1867, died in 1939.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is my cousin, him and his wife.  Actually she's still living.  He passed away about 10 years ago, General Green and Betsy Bowers.  Actually she is--has passed away since this book was published as well.  They held and lived in Tampa, Florida.  And he was one of the sons of Noah Bowers, my great-great cousin--uncle.  So he's my great-great-cousin.
Speaker 1: This is the Hayes family - my mother Edna Hayes standing in the background obviously with my father, John Hayes; and coming from, from the left to the right is Almedia Hayes, which is now Almedia Bannerman, my sister.  She is the second born.  In the middle is my brother, John Hayes, Jr.; he is the oldest of the three.  And then you come down to me, Cecil Mel Hayes, which is the youngest.  This photograph I think was made when I was about three or four years old.  But I do know where it was taken; it was taken at Mizell (ph.) Studio.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, we don't know who that lady in the middle is.  The, the day of the scrappy sandals (laughter).  This is on a, a journey with my family to New Jersey, short stop on the way to South Carolina, south of the board.  From my left to my right is my mother, Edna Hayes; we now call her Nana.  The lady next to her is myself, Cecil Hayes.  And we have an unknown guest there.  I, I don't know who she is.  But next to her is my sister, Almedia Bannerman.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Did we ever get a spelling for that, Sam, of Almedia Bannerman?
Speaker 2: No, can we get that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah I get it, B-A-N-N-E-R-M-A-N.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I'm sorry; one more time.
Speaker 1: B-A-N-N-E-R-M-A-N.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And how is Almedia spelled?
Speaker 1: A-L-M-E-D-I-A.
Speaker 2: This is a close-up of me, Cecil Hayes, at an Easter Sunday I'm sure.  And my age is approximately three and scared to death.  I think this is the same one came from the large photo.
Speaker 1: My how things change (laugher).  This--it seems that we're always gathering.  This is my--from left to right, Ernest Bannerman, my brother-in-law; my sister Almedia Bannerman; myself, Cecil Hayes; my husband, Arzell Powell.  And we were getting ready to go out to dinner on this photo.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And do you remember the year?
Speaker 1: No.  Let me see.  He still had hair at that time, so (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is--let see--10, 10th and 24th--14 years ago would be what?  Fourteen--fifteen, fifteen years ago.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--1987.
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987].  This photo was in 1987.  It's my family again.  And from left to right is my sister, Almedia Bannerman; my mother, Edna Hayes; Cecil in the middle, and the little girl down that you see is Leandra (ph.) Hayes and her father, John Hayes, Jr., standing directly behind her.  And this is in the backyard of my father still trying to be a farmer.  He's got tomatoes and peas growing back there (laughter).
Speaker 1: This is a good day for my father, the day I got married.  This is 18 years old, this photograph.  I can't go back--I don't know the year I got married.
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983]?
Speaker 1: Pardon?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983], May 24th, 1983.  It's my wedding photo, and that's about it.
Speaker 1: This is my little niece again, Leandra Hayes, and I suppose and myself, Cecil Hayes, at my mother's home.  Leandra was raised by my mom and father.  Unfortunately, her mother died in childbirth, so she became a child of our entire family.  My brother never remarried.
Speaker 2: Finally made it, Dillard High School [Fort Lauderdale, Florida] graduate, diploma in hand, 1963, Cecil Hayes.
Speaker 1: Oh, let me see if I know them.  They're deceased.  I don't know that much about her.  I mean I could tell you what I read there, but that's about it.
Speaker 2: My freshman--on--at home on vacation 1964 from Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  What I remember most about this photograph, if this is an appropriate time to tell, is the beautiful dress that my mother made.
Speaker 1: I would think that this is in '55' [1955] because I, I appear to be about 11 years old.  And it's in front of the house on 21st Avenue.  I know by the hedges.  And this is--we were big on Easter day, so this had to be Easter dress.
