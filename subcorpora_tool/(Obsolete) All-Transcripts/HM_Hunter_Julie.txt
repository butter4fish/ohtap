Story_ID: 60034
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to get started.  But I want to start off by asking you about your father, and what you know about his background and, you know, where he was raised.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father [Dez Corbett] was born in Aiken, South Carolina.  He comes from a mixed family.  Down there years ago, the families were integrated.  He lived, the Staley family lived on one side of the road.  And the Corbetts, who were white, lived on the other side.  So, the families intermingled.  My father was one of the off-springs of the Corbett and Staley mixture, and that was in Aiken, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Was that acknowledged, ma'am at the time openly, or was that--?
Speaker 2: Well, I believe so, because they accepted us as their grandchildren.  And it was just two families, just integrated together.  They lived together and they worshipped together; they did everything together, from my memory as a child.
Speaker 1: And tell us about your father, what he did.  And I know you list him as a superintendent of the post office.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But did he talk... did he talk anymore about growing up, you know, in his early years?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a farmer at first in South Carolina, because he worked with his father, who was a farmer.  And then they finally migrated to Jacksonville, Florida where he did various jobs.  And then he finally landed the job in the post office, and he worked himself up to become a superintendent.  And at that time the depots and the stations, train stations, and the post office were intermingled.  And he was in charge of... superintendent of the post office and the train services there.
Speaker 1: And what kind of man was he?
Speaker 2: He was a fine, good-looking dude.  He was sharp... he was a womanizer, unfortunately.  And he just gave us, my mother [Mary Staley Corbett], a hard time because he was very, very agreeable to the ladies.
Story_ID: 60035
Speaker 1: Now, your mother, her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mary Staley Corbett.
Speaker 1: And can you...her maiden name [unclear]?
Speaker 2: Staley.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about her and her family.
Speaker 2: Well, she was also born in Aiken [South Carolina].  And when my mother and dad [Dez Corbett] married, they finally moved to Jacksonville, Florida.  And she was always--could sew, and she became a dressmaker there.  And she sewed for many of the Caucasians there, and blacks.  And she made all of my clothes until I was about fifteen years old, and rebelled.  And then that was it.  Even when we moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], she still was a dressmaker.
Speaker 1: And you said that you know a little bit more about that part of the family.  But I'm wondering, did she talk about growing up in Aiken at that time?
Speaker 2: No, not too much.
Story_ID: 60036
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said before, the Staleys lived on one side of the road, and the Corbetts lived on the other; they lived right across the road.  Both families were farmers.  And you know how they go from one farm to the other?  And that's how my dad [Dez Corbett] met my mother [Mary Staley Corbett], and they were married.
Speaker 1: Do you know how they ended up moving, or why they ended up moving to Jacksonville, Florida, from, you know, from Aiken [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think that my father had ideas of doing--he didn't want to be a farmer.  He wanted bigger things.  And it was right after the World War I--he, my uncle, had just come out of the service.  And he went to Florida, and he was doing very successfully there as a contractor.  And my father figured there were--the grass was greener down in Florida than in South Carolina.  So he went, he left Aiken and went to South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Now, you were--so how, do you know how--did they immediately go, after they got married, to Jacksonville, Florida?
Speaker 2: Well, I think... well, my brother was older.  So, he was born in Aiken in 1910.  And they lived there while he was young.  And then I was born in Florida.  So, it was about two years after they married that they, he went to Florida.
Speaker 1: And your brother, can you give his name?
Speaker 2: His name is James Corbett.
Story_ID: 60037
Speaker 1: Now, when you... what were some of your earliest memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I was always athletically inclined in school.  And I used to run and jump, run track, play basketball, all types of sports.  And anything that was musical in the theater...in the schools...I would participate in that as a youngster, even from the ages of kindergarten up to the time I became an adult.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what elementary school you went to, and what the name was?
Speaker 2: In Jacksonville, Florida, I went to Staten High School.  High school and elementary was all together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 60038
Speaker 1: And what was the community like there?  Was it mainly a black community that you lived--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was all black middle class.  They all were pretty good livers then.  Even though it was very, very--you know money wasn't flourishing then.  But they lived pretty well, because my father [Dez Corbett] had a good job and my mother [Mary Staley Corbett] was doing well.
Speaker 1: And can you just describe what family life was like?
Speaker 2: We had a very good family life.  We'd...I enjoyed our dinners together, especially on Sundays.  We'd sit around...and my mother was a good cook, and we'd have good...After coming from church, we'd have a good family meal.  But the only unfortunate thing about it, is my mother and my dad separated.  Remember, I told you my father was a womanizer.  And then he just made her very unhappy.  And they separated when I was about seven or eight years old.  She moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and I was left there with my father.  My brother and I were left there.  And she said she was going to send for us as soon as she became established in Philadelphia.  Well, anyway, my father whipped my brother [James Corbett]...and I'm a little ahead of myself.  Because they, after my mother left, she asked the Daniels family--Billy Daniels, the singer--they were distant cousins of us.  And she asked them to take me to, keep me there for a while, and she was going to send for me when school was out.  But my father whipped my brother, and they thought that was just a crime--child abuse at that time.  And they wrote my mother and said, "Your father, he has whipped this child, and hit him with a..."  He just hit him on the legs with the broomstick.  And my mother sent for my brother.  And I was hysterical, because I wanted to come with my mother, too.  Well, sure enough when school was out, my father let me visit my mother in Philadelphia.  And unfortunately, I never saw my father again.  Because the minute I got to New York, to Philadelphia, rather, she moved, and never allowed us to contact my father again.  That's my childhood as...up until about seven or eight years old, with my mother and father.
Story_ID: 60039
Speaker 1: So, you moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when you were seven or eight?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Around that time period.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How were you feeling?  That was sort of a difficult period, I would imagine.
Speaker 2: I was, yes, very sad, because I loved my father [Dez Corbett].  He was good to me, I was his little darling.  And I knew it was difficult for my mother [Mary Staley Corbett] to get established there.  But finally she did, and then she re-married again after my father died.  My father died, oh, I think about 1939 or something like that, and then she re-married.
Speaker 1: So Philadelphia, where did you live in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: I was, I lived in South Philadelphia, at 22nd and Wharton.
Speaker 1: And what was this experience?  Because you really at that point were pretty much a southerner--young though, still...you know, young.  But--
Speaker 2: Well, I became active.  I was always a good student in school, and I became active with the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  And I ran...I was athletically inclined, I told you that.  And my time was spent at the YWCA or working with the groups--volunteering, working with children.  St. Peter's Claver used to have the dinner dances there on Saturday nights for youths, from twelve up to sixteen.  And I would help them get those dances together on Saturday nights.  And it was, it was all formal; the children had to come dressed up in formal clothes with little white gloves on.  The fellows had to wear the white shirts and black ties.  And they all wore the gloves, the little girls with the gloves on.  And that was very, very...had a tremendous like effect on me.  That's where I met my husband, at one of the dinner dances.  And that was a wonderful, wonderful thing.
Story_ID: 60040
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of child were you, would you say?  And you know, I mean were you--I know you were athletic.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You said that.  But, I know you liked to sing.  But what, what type of child were you?  Were you a dreamer? Were you introspective?  Were you outgoing?  Were you gregarious?  Were you--?
Speaker 2: I was...I say I liked to...I was a dreamer, I think.  Because I liked to...  My future, I always looked out...what am I going to do when I grow up?  What am I going to do when I leave my mother [Mary Staley Corbett]?  And I always had a plan that I wanted to either be in business...I knew I always wanted to work...not--work for myself.  I knew I wanted to be either a funeral director, or to sing, or be in some kind of business.  I know years ago, I guess I was about five or six, in Florida.  I saw these fabulous funeral establishments.  And I was very much impressed, because I saw these black, shiny cars, and the establishments were so well...with the shrubbery and the flowers and the lights.  And I was fascinated with it.  And I said, "That's what I want to do when I grow up."  And sure enough, when I came to New York it was my intention to register in these funeral classes there.  But I saw, I was disillusioned when I got to New York.  Because they had nothing but little small storefront funeral homes.  And I said, "No, this is not for me.  I will have to do something else; I'm going to be in business.  I'm going to do something in business."  But I didn't know what at the time.  So, what happened, show business got to me first, because...
Story_ID: 60041
Speaker 1: Am I jumping--[simultaneous]
Speaker 2: I want to just take you back to your childhood.  And I was--one question I ask people sometimes is what sights, smells, and sounds, remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 1: Sights... other than--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: --I liked outdoors.  Would that be in... outdoors?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Anything, anything.  It doesn't have to be anything.  Anything that reminds you of your childhood--anything, it could be the smell of grass...  It could be, you know... you know, anything.
Speaker 1: I'll think of it later, but I can't think of anything now.
Speaker 2: You can't?  Okay, that's okay, it's no problem.  So, you, how old were you when you came--
Speaker 1: Trains would probably...trains.
Speaker 2: Okay, go on.
Speaker 1: And I would say trains would remind me of my childhood, because I spent so much time riding on trains.  Because my father [Dez Corbett] was able to get passes for us to ride back and forth from Florida to South Carolina.  And they put a tag on my brother [James Corbett] and I, and they'd send us back and forth, so much so, that it became--my grandparents used to say people on the way would say, "There go those little gray-eyed children back to South Carolina, back to Jacksonville, Florida."  And then I remember one Easter when we went to South Carolina, they had a program there, that they trained the children to say poems at Easter time.  And I had a chance, an opportunity to say my poem.  And coming from Florida, naturally, they thought that I was really sort of "skitty-ditty," you know.  And my mother had me a little Easter, pretty little Easter dress.  And all the children said their little poems and sat down.  And I got up and said my little poem and says, "What you looking at me so hard for?  I didn't come to stay.  I just come to let you know that this Easter Day."  And I bowed--instead of bowing, I took and made the salute, because it was the Army.  And the audience just went wild, because, "City style, city style," I'm coming from Florida.  You know, these are country people.  And that, I felt good.  I guess I was about seven years old, six years old.  I felt good getting the applause, and the audience liking what I did.  And I think that is what inspired me to go into singing.  And later on in life when I was...had gone to the theatre and arrived on Broadway--many times I remember in that little church, maybe about 50 or 60 people, when I did that salute and got those applause.  I just reveled in that, and in those memories.
Story_ID: 60042
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in high school, were you doing any singing during that time?
Speaker 2: Only with, at the Y [WCA], when I was at the Y.
Speaker 1: Talk about the Y.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, because you were pretty active in the Y, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did all the sports there, and we played all the basketball games.  The girls' teams played basketball and the preliminaries for Howard University and for Lincoln and Penn State.  We had a great team, and all... very influential young girls.  At that time there was a young lady named Edna Lubbing that was a doctor.  And there was Marie Byrd, who married Ted Poston, who was a big editor at the Courier, Pittsburg Post.  And we had a marvelous time playing basketball.  And then--I was going to tell you something else about my childhood.
Speaker 1: But I wanted to ask... Okay--
Speaker 2: Oh, about the Y.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Y.
Speaker 2: Yes.  When we were at the Y, we'd give teas, and we raised funds there for the underprivileged, for the children.  And Mrs. Emily Pickens, who was a very, very...director there, great director.  And she asked me to help them many times to put on these shows.  And that's how it became known that I would, could do, was a ham--I could do some sort of singing, or something like that.  And that came from listening to the graphophones at that time, which is now Victrolas or...I didn't have radio.  And I would listen to all the songs, and I'd get up there and I'd act like Bessie Smith.  One time, I'd be Ethel Waters...anyone who was very prominent at that time, I would imitate them.  And that's how it became known that I had some sort of talent.
Speaker 1: And the Y that you attended, do you remember its location in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: It was 16th and Catherine, in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Now, when you would imitate Ethel Waters, do you, did you have a favorite song that, you know, you liked that...?  Or Bessie Smith?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Yes, it's one, but I can't sing it now.
Speaker 1: You can't?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the lyrics.  But Bessie Smith is, [singing]:  "Muddy Waters, 'round the street.  Oh!"  I used to do that sort of stuff.  Then with Ethel Waters, it was more... "Stormy Weather" was not out then, but I would sing Stormy Weather later on in life.
Story_ID: 60043
Speaker 1: So, you were very active in high school in the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And I mean, right, YWCA.  Were there any other activities that you were involved with?
Speaker 2: Well, they would put on various shows in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And we had social clubs, a lot of social clubs then.
Speaker 1: What were some of the social clubs?
Speaker 2: The club called the, we called ourselves the "Salon Detorati (ph.)."  Everything was Greek at that time, you know, we had to be very social--Salon Decorti (ph.) And then we had another club called the Florettes, the Florettes.  And there were a bunch of very social Philadelphia young ladies at the time then.  Some of them become famous, very famous women later in life.
Speaker 1: Do you have an example--you know, anyone that you can think of, you know, that became--
Speaker 2: Well, Marie Byrd, who married Ted Poston.  And then she finally married a very wealthy man, a Mr. Jackson in Chicago [Illinois], I think in Chicago.  And then our coach in basketball was Sparky Jones.  He was a very famous Lincoln man.  And then, let me see, I can't think of any other right now.
Story_ID: 60044
Speaker 1: Oh, go ahead.
Speaker 2: I was so engrossed with the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], that even when I came in the theater, instead of living in a hotel, I lived at the YWCA, because that was my roost.  And at that time, Lena Horne was there.  And it was very, very nice, on a 137th and St. Nicholas--I mean on 7th Avenue here in New York City.  It was a very, very nice place to stay.  And any town that I'd go to, I'd stay at the YWCA, because it was good elements for young ladies at that time of the year.
Speaker 1: Because people need to... because it's different a lot from the YWCA today.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So, but they had places to stay?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They were very fine places for ladies, young ladies.  As a matter of fact they had a school then. The cafeterias and the rooms were lovely.  And it was just nice surroundings for a stranger in the town that had been accustomed to being sheltered, you know. Now, did your mother [Mary Staley Corbett] re-marry when she got to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Yes, she did.  Not right away, but later on in life she did marry.
Speaker 2: But did she raise you through your teen years as a single parent, or--?
Speaker 1: Yes, she did.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 60045
Speaker 1: And now, you, so how did you meet your husband, and what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Eddie, Edward Hunter.  I met him at the dinner dances.  He belonged to a very bourgeois group of...a club in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And every Saturday night these boys would come down to the Y [WCA], to St. Peter's Claver, to the dinner dances.  And one of the chap's father had given him a convertible car.  It was about I guess 1920, or something like that... and the boy was, I mean.  And to have a convertible at that age in that, in those days, that was really the upper class.  So, they asked us after the dinner dance, my girlfriends and I, to go out--the club members, rather--go with them to a party.  And we all, about twenty of us, piled into this one convertible and went to this party.  And my husband was in the group.  But he was very handsome, and I just knew he wasn't going to look at me.  But that evening he asked me if he could come to visit me, and I said yes.  And we were...courted for about a year, and then we became engaged.
Story_ID: 60046
Speaker 1: The other thing I want to know...for those of us who don't really know about Philadelphia...Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] is a big society town.
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: It has an old black history.  Can you just describe what the community, the black community, was like during that--and you know, and who was really predominant, you know, there.
Speaker 2: Philadelphia is a city of narrow streets, white steps...and we had to clean them every day.  Because all the houses looked alike, and all these white steps that were there, we had...And there's a South Philadelphia and there's a West Philadelphia.  And most of the bourgeois people lived in West Philadelphia, and I lived in South Philadelphia.  But I traveled with the group that lived out in West Philadelphia.  And then there was a lot of going to church, and visiting from house to house.  And-
Speaker 1: Now, how did you get accepted into the West Philadelphia group?
Speaker 2: From the Y [WCA], and then it became known...it was known that I was, could sing.  And being in the clubs, in these various clubs.  You know, I was very popular as a young girl...very popular, very active.
Speaker 1: And was that something your mother [Mary Staley Corbett] encouraged?  Or you were just outgoing and--
Speaker 2: I just think I was outgoing, you know.  It was just something that I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: So, you met your husband [Edward Hunter] that evening?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: At, you know, in the convertible.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And where were you guys going?  You were going to a party--
Speaker 2: To a party.  Yes, the dance was out about ten o'clock, and we had two hours to go the party, because we had to be home at 12.  So, we go to the party and had fun, and then they brought us home.
Speaker 1: And so you get married, you say, a year after that, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 60047
Speaker 1: So, can you talk about the early, you know, the time of being married... your early years with your husband [Edward Hunter]?
Speaker 2: Yes, we married.  And fortunately he had, he was a chef cook.  And he'd saved ten thousand dollars, which was a tremendous amount of money back in those days.  And we were married.  We had this ten thousand dollars, and made a down payment on a house, down payment on a car, down payment on furniture, down payment on everything.  But we didn't pay for nothing outright.  So, the Depression came and we lost everything.  We were poor, actually poor.  And I had a lot of clothes; my husband had a lot of clothes, because everything was formal during those days.  You had to wear--the fellows had to wear tuxedos, and long coats...the long frock coats, the spat shoes, and the high hats and whatnot, you know.  They just dressed up for those affairs.  And the need of money--he would probably have to pawn a suit.  Because we had... we lost our house, we lost the car, we lost the furniture...we lost everything.  And we had to take a room, $4.50 a week.  And I, my husband wouldn't work for $35 a week, because he called that a boy's salary.  So, I had to take a job.  And the job was in a very, very, exclusive dress shop in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], the Alice Pearlman Dress Shop.  And I saw this ad in the paper, and I applied.  And there must have been fifty girls there, and I got the job.  I asked the lady...the lady said to me, "Do you know why I hired you?"  I said, "No, I don't."  She said, "Because you're the only girl who looked me in my eyes when interviewed you."  And I thought that was a good, good lesson, I've learned a good trait--look you in your eyes and be honest and truthful.  And I got this job, six dollars a week.  If--and I had $4.50 room rent to pay.  If I ate a hot dog for just five cents, I'd have to walk to work.  But if I walked to work, I could have a hot dog for lunch.  But in the meantime my husband was pawning his suits, pawning this, pawning that... and I pawned my wedding band to make ends meet.  And then finally he got a job.  And I started getting a job, and I got a job going into the theater.  Should I tell you about that now or later?
Speaker 1: Right, well, I want to get to that going to get to that.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: So, you and your husband made a very striking couple, I can imagine.
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.  Because he was tall, good-looking, Indian type of fellow.  But he was handsome, very handsome, and a very good husband, too.
Speaker 1: And so this...this period.  So, you were married all of what?  Like a year before the Depression hit?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Well, what--
Speaker 2: No, no.  We were married only about two or three months--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --after the--when the Depression came.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Because we had to...we had...all our money was spent going, you know, buying homes... buying the house--down payment, getting the furniture and the car.  We got all...the whole works, and then...just pulled out from under us.
Speaker 1: And so, but you were in good company, because everyone else was going through the same thing.
Speaker 2: That's true, very true...it wasn't...very true.  And my mother [Mary Staley Corbett] lived just around the corner.  And she was... but I was too proud to go around there and eat up her food, because I figured I'm on my own, I'm a woman now, and I should act like a woman and take care of myself.  But finally...that period lasted about, I guess about six months, and we started getting back on our feet again.
Story_ID: 60048
Speaker 1: --five foot, and she was blond and blue-eyed.  And we'd go up to their house, and I'd say, "Are you my grandma?"  She says, "Yes, child, come on and get some cakes and cookies... cakes and milk.  She was very, very...we were just... And all the kids played together, it was just wonderful.
Speaker 2: (unintelligible)...  That's the whole thing, because you don't hear, you don't hear much of that.
Speaker 1: It goes on, but it's not acknowledged, I guess.
Speaker 2: It's not acknowledged, right.
Speaker 1: But they did acknowledge us.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: And you know, that's still there now.
Speaker 2: It is?
Speaker 1: Yes.  We went there and saw it.
Speaker 2: Okay, can you--oh, you went there and saw what?
Speaker 1: The family's places--the Corbett place and the Staley place...the road that divided them.  And they named the roads now.  One road is Corbett Road, one road is Staley Road.  We couldn't find it, because we went for a family reunion there, and we couldn't find the place.  And we looked up and said, "There, there's a high school, Corbett High School, over there."  And they said, "Julie, your name was Corbett."  I said, "Yes."  And I said, "Let's go down this road."  And we went down that road.  And we got down there and we saw the road, Corbett Road, Staley Road.  Then we knew we had found our location.  And the Corbett family has just acres and acres, like blocks and blocks of land.  And this big high school sits on the corner, and in the back they have their homes and estates back there.  And the Staley family on the other side road--this big house sits off...back behind off the road, and nothing but flowers and green shrubbery.  And we found one of the Staleys, Reverend Staley, still living there.  So, and the landmark is still listed, it's Staley and Corbett landmarks.
Story_ID: 60049
Speaker 1: Now, so you and your husband [Edward Hunter], you know, the Depression hits.  You make it, you start getting back on your feet.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But in the meantime, you've pawned everything.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, right.
Speaker 1: And so, what happens?  How do you... you know, you... you know, you were telling me earlier about how you got involved in, you know, in singing.
Speaker 2: Well, we have a home now.  We have a--we're now... my husband's working, I'm working at the dress shop, and we have bought furniture.  And this evening we had gone to bed.  So about 10:30 that night, three gentlemen, someone rang the doorbell.  And my husband went downstairs, and there were three gentlemen at the door.  And he invited them in, and they came in and talked to him, and he said... called me and I came down.  And he said, "These gentlemen want you to sing in the club."  He said, "You've never been in a nightclub in your life.  How can you sing in a club?"  And I said, "Well, what's it all about?"  The gentleman said, "Well, our featured singer has come down with the grip."  The grip then, back in those days, was what we know as the flu now.  "And this singer's going to be out for three weeks.  So, and we need someone.  We know that your wife can sing because she's been recommended from the Y [MCA] and these shows we put on in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], these various fundraising shows."  And between the three men and I... we prevailed upon my husband.  I said, "You know we have to buy this, we gotta buy that.  And they're going to pay seventy-five dollars a week.  And we can buy... get on our feet.  You know, we have to buy more furniture... I can my fur coat."  Right away, I'm thinking about myself, you know.  And well, they said, "Well, it's just going to be for three weeks.  And it's a dinner show.  She doesn't have to leave her job, she can keep her day job.  And she'd be home at least by 10:00 at night."  So, we prevailed upon him, and he said okay.  And I went there.  The first week there, they gave me--they liked me so well.  It was an exclusive club.  And the boss gave me a twenty-five dollar raise; I don't know what he did for the other people in the show.  But in this show was Tiny Bradshaw, Stump and Stumpy, Ida James, Amy Spencer and Dorothy Rhodes.  And we would... at the end of the show, after each performance, you'd say goodnight to your guests, and the cast would come out and stand.  And the guests would come over and say, "We enjoyed you so much.  Oh, you're wonderful."  And they'd shake your hand.  You'd look at your hand, and you'd have a ten dollar bill or a fifty dollar bill or a twenty dollar bill, whatever they wanted to give you.  And they would... this lasted... I went to work for them in September.  And they renewed my contract, renewed my contract, and I stayed there until the following June there with the show.  And that's how I got into show business.
Speaker 1: And what were your--what was the name of the club?
Speaker 2: Bernie's Supper Club.
Speaker 1: And that was in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so what was your husband thinking of this, during this time?
Speaker 2: Well, he didn't mind because--well, he was enjoying it, because he'd come to see every... pick me up every night, and he could see the shows.  And he felt he was a celebrity, too.  (Laughter).  And it was a lot of fun, a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 60050
Speaker 1: So now, what was your act then?  What...were you singing, or--?
Speaker 2: I was singing.
Speaker 1: What were some of the songs you sang?
Speaker 2: I sang a song called--well, I was very vivacious... young and vivacious.  And I sang, "Took the moon out of the sky, put the moon right in your eye.  Oh, baby, you're such a beautiful thing."  And then I did a song, Mrs. Louis Armstrong wrote a song called "Brown Gal."  And I got permission from her to sing that song, and that became my trademark. "I'm just a brown gal, brown gal, making my life a bubble.  Not even taking the trouble to blow my bubbles away."  That's enough of that, isn't it?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  That's nice, okay.  So, did you like it?  Did you like performing?  How did it feel being up on that stage?
Speaker 2: I loved it, I loved it... I loved it.  It was, well, it, I was not "show people."  When I say that... I didn't participate in the nightlife of the show, but I did, I liked what I was doing.  I liked being successful; I liked the money that I was making, and the traveling that it involved.  And I didn't know how long it was going to last, but I said at least I was making good money.
Speaker 1: So, when you say you didn't participate in the show life--
Speaker 2: No, I mean--
Speaker 1: What does that mean?
Speaker 2: I meant I wasn't one--I didn't drink or smoke at the time.  I didn't go out to nightclubs.  I would go to work, but kept... I was always into fashion.  I would always buy a lot of good clothes and save my money, because I knew it was going to be a short--I thought it was going to be a short span.  You know, I didn't think it was going to be forever; I didn't plan it forever.
Speaker 1: Now, so you went from--so you performed there for like nine months.
Speaker 2: Nine months.
Speaker 1: When it was supposed to originally three weeks?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 60051
Speaker 1: And then what happened after that?
Speaker 2: While I was working there, the gentleman who owned the Harlem Club [Club Harlem] in Atlantic City [New Jersey], Mr. Leroy Williams, he came up and caught the show one night.  And he didn't say anything to me, but we knew he was in the audience.  And later on he contacted me, and said that the Larry Steele show was going to open there that June, and that his show would last from June to September, and they needed a singer.  So, my husband [Edward Hunter]... I approached my husband.  He said, no, I couldn't go.  And I said, "Well, it's only going to be for six weeks.  Since it's summer, and Philadelphia's [Pennsylvania] so close to Atlantic City, it would be a vacation for you, because you could come down every weekend.  Well, I prevailed upon him, and he agreed.  And this was a very, oh, high class show.  It was Larry Steele and his Beauties, it was Billy Daniels, Billie Holiday, Stump and Stumpy--not Stump and Stumpy--Ralph Brown, Marv Johnson and Julie Hunter, and all the Beauties.  And now Moms Mabley--who was that?  Moms...
Speaker 1: Moms Mabley.
Speaker 2: Moms Mabley, she was there.  It was a wonderful show, and that lasted, the six weeks, from June to September.
Story_ID: 60052
Speaker 1: And while I was there [Atlantic City, New Jersey], a gentleman came down from Canada.  And he liked me, and asked if I could come to Canada.  And my husband [Edward Hunter] said, "No, no, no.  It's alright here, as long as you're in the country, but not out of the country."  And I told him, I said, "Well, you know, if we go to Canada, you could come up when my four weeks is over..."  The contract was only for four weeks.  "... and it'll be a vacation for you.  We could see other parts of the world."  And I showed him the points, and he said alright, and agreed to it.  And I got up there and was quite successful up there, and made a lot of money.  Because the people up there, they would throw money on the stage at you when you sang... just throw the money on the stage.  And I made a lot of money there.  So, lo and behold, a telegram came.  It was, "We offer you a week at the Apollo Theatre."  Oh, that was Mecca, (Laughter) manna from heaven, a hundred and twenty-five dollars a week.  I didn't care about the money, but I just wanted to be showing at the Apollo Theater.  That was--you have arrived, you know.  And sure enough, I came to the Apollo Theater and I was in the--booked in the theater with Count Basie, the Count Basie Show.  They put on this show called "The Seven Dwarfs," and I was Snow White in this show.  And that show led me to other things.  One, I was very fortunate, I... very... never had a layoff--only between... like traveling from one place to another.  I had five lucrative years.  And from there I went to Washington.  We went from Washington to Philadelphia.  Then we had booked with the Jimmy Lunceford show up in New England, toured that; and worked with Edgar Hayes and the Blue Rhythm Boys.  I worked... then I went to... came back to New York [New York City, New York] and went to the Kit Kat Club.  And there I stayed for about a year, and that's where you really made...  There was a club on the East Side of New York; it was the second club to the Cotton Club.  And it was owned by the mobsters at that time.  And I came down with, got sick, and I had to come home and stay for about a week.  That was the only time I had any time off.  And while I was sick, a fellow named Teddy Blackmon came from Detroit [Michigan].  He was a producer, and asked me could I come... go to Detroit.  I had a good job here working at the Kit Kat Club, and I didn't want to leave that.  But I went down and I spoke to my boss.  He said, "Sure, but when you leave there, come back.  You have a job here."  So, I went to Detroit at the Plantation Club, and that was supposed to be a four-week contract.  And I stayed out there about six months, or a little more.  And that show was Bill Bailey, Pearl Bailey, Julie Hunter, Ralph Brown, and the chorus girls and whatnot.  And from there, the Jones Brothers, who were from Chicago [Illinois]... had that big department store.  They all were very... would come back and forth from Detroit to Chicago.  And they saw me, and they got me into the Grand Terrace.  And at that time it was Earl Hines, and the show that I was in was the Louis Armstrong show.  And I stayed out there for four weeks, and then I came back to Detroit.  And then, and had another show.  And from there, we came back to New York and went back to my Kit Kat Club.  And while I was there, my husband took sick.  And I got this telegram saying your husband is very, very ill, and come right away.  And I--he was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and I was living in New York.  But all during that time, we were very close.  I'd visit him, or he'd visit me.  We were still together, my husband and I.  And when I got to Philadelphia they said, "Your husband is very, very ill."  They said, "It's just a matter of time.  He has, unfortunately, one lung and only fragments of others."  It's just... this was in, I think, January, and he died that March.  And that was the end.  And while on his deathbed, sick bed, he asked me to not be in show business.  He said, "You know, we're not show people."  He said, "I would feel so much better if you would not be in show business."  And I promised him that I would not sign another contract, and I didn't.  And then I went back and registered in school, and started on my career in the business.
Story_ID: 60053
Speaker 1: Now, I want to ask you a little bit more about, you know, the shows that you were performing in, and the clubs.  Who were the owners of a lot of these clubs where you performed--whether it was the Kit Kat Club or...  Were they all--you know, you had mentioned...  I mean, who even owned the Apollo Theater at the time?
Speaker 2: The Apollo Theater was owned by a Schiffman [Frank Schiffman].  He and his son ran the--
Speaker 1: Were they Jewish?
Speaker 2: Yes, Jewish people, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, Jewish.  And was places like the Kit Kat Club and some of these others, were they--
Speaker 2: That was owned by Jules Podell, who owned the Copacabana; he owned that club and the Copacabana.  And this was all--it was a big show, a big show, had a lovely show down at the Kit Kat.  And the club in Detroit [Michigan] was owned by a black man named Walker Norwood, and that was the Plantation Club.
Speaker 1: But the first person you worked for... remember the one who recruited you from the show...  You know, it was after you did your stint.  And he... remember you were saying earlier that he had maids.  That was when you were on the lineup I think with Moms Mabley and--
Speaker 2: Oh, the band they took to Canada?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  No, no, no, no, it was someone named Williams--not Williams...
Speaker 2: That was Leroy Williams, who owned the Cotton--the Harlem's Club in Atlantic City [New Jersey], the Harlem.  He was black, like--
Speaker 1: He was black?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh. Okay.  So there was a lot, there was at least a decent amount of clubs owned by blacks?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There were very wealthy people out in Chicago [Illinois] and in Detroit [Michigan].  And there were--all of the club owners, you know... I don't know if you remember.  What's that?  I can't think of his name.  No point in calling it, because...  Oh, gosh, I can't think of his name.
Story_ID: 60054
Speaker 1: Now, did you--tell me about... I mean, did you have... when you were on the lineup with Moms Mabley, did you have much interaction with her?
Speaker 2: No, I was afraid of her.  (Laughter).  Not that she'd done anything to me, but I just was afraid of her.  But I did have a lot of... with Billie, Billie Holiday, and--
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?  And what years were this?
Speaker 2: That was after, well, it was 1937 or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen Thirty-Seven [1937], I think.
Speaker 1: So, really about two years...  Your husband [Edward Hunter] died in 1939.
Speaker 2: That's right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, tell us--so what about Billie Holiday?  What was--?
Speaker 1: Oh, she was a charming person.  She stayed mostly to herself.  She had a friend, a very close friend who would come every night.  And they would, oh, hang out most of the time together.  But I didn't hang out with any of them, because I... I didn't... I was sort of a loner.  And as I said, I wasn't show.  You know, I didn't drink and smoke, so we didn't have anything in common.  So, I would get a book and read in between the shows, or go out.  I knew a lot of people, being from Philadelphia.  They'd come down and we'd go out and walk, or something like that--just socialize with them in between shows.
Story_ID: 60055
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: You said that you were afraid of Moms Mabley.  Was she like her onstage... her onstage personality with you?
Speaker 1: Yes, she was crazy.  She would cut up and whatnot.  And she would (Laughter), I think she... She made me afraid of her because she picked at me, you know what I mean... but in mischievously, you know, just...  And the girls knew that I was afraid of her, and they would tell her, "Get her, get her."  (Laughter).  And I was frightened.  But then we turned out to be very good friends later on, after I moved to New York [New York City, New York] and met her again in New York.  She was a wonderful person, a wonderful person.  And she had such a sense of humor, and she was kind and compassionate; she was a lovely person.
Speaker 2: So she, did she look offstage like she looked onstage with all her get-up?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes. (Laughter).
Story_ID: 60056
Speaker 1: Okay, and let's see.  Who else did you mention you were in the lineup with besides...?  Let's see, it was--
Speaker 2: Billy Daniels?
Speaker 1: Yes, what about him?  What was he...?
Speaker 2: Well, Billy was, he was a star; naturally he was the star of the show.  And at that time, I didn't know he was my cousin.  Because the Daniels at the time... I didn't... being young, I didn't think of it.  Because after we moved to Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I didn't see the Daniels' anymore.  But then when I did discover that we were related, I went backstage and spoke to him.  And he was so happy.  He embraced me, and his wife was there with his two sons.  And he said, "This is your cousin."  And he was, he just was so gracious.  And everybody loved him, everybody.  He was just unbelievable.  He was talented... and unfortunately, he imbibed a lot.  But that his business, you know.
Story_ID: 60057
Speaker 1: Well, did, how were the shows put together?  Who was the... who were, you know what I mean...  Everyone had their own talent.  But I'm just saying, who actually organized all of you?
Speaker 2: They would have a producer.
Speaker 1: Who was the producer?
Speaker 2: Larry Steele put on the show at the Harlem Club [Club Harlem, Atlantic City, New Jersey].  And he, he, well, what they'd do...  Each performer would have their own agent.  And they would contact the agents and get the talent through the agents.  And the producer would put the show together, the rundown of the show.
Speaker 1: So, who was your agent?
Speaker 2: I didn't have an agent.  (Laughter).  Julie Hunter was the agent.  Because I was too young... I didn't know anything about show business, you know.
Speaker 1: And around this time, you're in your twenties, though, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about twenty, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 60058
Speaker 1: Now also, who, what about Count Basie?  What was that interaction like?  Or what was he... you know?
Speaker 2: Well, at the theater--
Speaker 1: Weren't... you said that you were at the Apollo Theater [Harlem, New York City, New York] with him, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was a big deal.
Speaker 2: It was a big deal.  Well, you know, unfortunately, you don't see these people much in the show.  Because when you're in a show, everything has to go clockwork.  And you're here putting on your costumes and makeup, and you're just... your own...  You don't see what they're doing, because you're so busy taking care of your little act and whatnot.  But working with him was great, because you know you're in a show with him, and you get good ratings, you know.  But I didn't have much inter...  But Pearl Bailey, now we were in the same dressing room.  So, we had a lot of...  At that time she was just a choreographer... what do you call... she danced before the chorus.  She wasn't singing.  And I don't know how--she came to New York.  Well, this is in Detroit [Michigan], and when she came to New York [New York City, New York], one of the bands hired her and that... she took off from there.  She was something else.  She was extremely talented, and had a great career.
Story_ID: 60059
Speaker 1: And then when you were--when you performed at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York City, New York], what was the Apollo like at that point and time?  And what--are we talking still about like 1937, '38' [1938] when you were performing there?
Speaker 2: Yes, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it was owned by whites--a Schiffman [Frank Schiffman] and his...  And at that time Leonard Harper was putting on his shows, and a guy named Cary would put on shows at times.  And another producer, Clarence Robinson, he would put on shows.  And it was up to the producers what talents they took into the shows with them.  And Clarence Robinson and Leonard Harper handled me most of the time.  They would get me bookings in various places.  And they booked me with the Jimmy Lunceford Show, and we traveled the New England states.  And Teddy Blackmon was a producer from Detroit [Michigan], and he contacted me personally himself.
Story_ID: 60060
Speaker 1: And did you, did you like the business?  Did you like performing and everything?  Were there things--because I know that your husband [Edward Hunter] says, you know, "We really are not show biz people."  But why--except that he, you know, passed away, and that was his request--do you think you would have stayed with it?
Speaker 2: If, had he not passed?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yes, I would stayed, because I was making good money, very good money.  I liked the money that was in it, you know.  And it wasn't stressful.  And I could travel; and wherever you'd go, the red carpet was out, rolled out for you.  You'd meet the better class of people in the city, and you, you were recognized.  And I liked that feeling that I got from being recognized, you know.
Story_ID: 60061
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about your first--when you first came to New York [New York City, New York].  Was it... you came to New York when?
Speaker 2: In...
Speaker 1: Was that for, to go to the--?
Speaker 2: To go to the Apollo Theater [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: The Apollo Theater?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that was... this was really...  And you liked New York, right?
Speaker 2: I loved New York.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you like about it?
Speaker 2: Well, I loved the streets, those wide streets; because Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] had those little narrow streets.  And I loved the way the New Yorkers behaved.  They didn't care who you were or what you were; you were accepted.  They could live next door to you, and nobody would interfere in your business, you know.  Whereas, Philadelphia was very clannish, and if you didn't come from such and such a family, you were not accepted.  You just... in New York, you're another person, and you're one of the New Yorkers. And I liked that, I liked that.
Speaker 1: And what--who were some of the real sort of movers and shakers around that time, you know, in New York?
Speaker 2: I don't know...
Speaker 1: You were staying at the Y [WCA], right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You were staying--
Speaker 2: It was Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.], Hope Stevens... Johnson--what's his name... Arnold Johnson, A. Philip Randolph [Asa Philip Randolph].  They were the ones who integrated 125th Street.  They were the ones who were doing everything to get things integrated in Harlem [New York City, New York].  And when I came out of show business, they were putting blacks into the stores on 125th Street.  And they put me into Woolworth in the music counter.  And I was handling the music counter there, and was going to school at night.
Story_ID: 60062
Speaker 1: And so, it was that point you moved here after... Did you move here after--?
Speaker 2: I stayed here, stayed in New York [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: After your husband [Edward Hunter] passed away?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you went back.  Was it, was it of concern with you when they told you about your husband's health?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  But I didn't go back to live, because I, there was nothing I could do for him.  He was in the hospital, and I knew it was just a matter of time, because the doctor told me that.  And with the one lung gone and fragments of the other, it was...  He lived from January to March, it was just about two months.  So, I didn't have much choice.
Speaker 1: And you were--so you were relatively a young widow though, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And was that a hard period for you?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  I grieved for my husband, but I was happy to have freedom.  (Laughter).  Freedom.
Speaker 1: You didn't have to answer to anybody.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right, exactly, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  You're a modern day woman.
Speaker 2: Oh, I think so... I think so.
Story_ID: 60063
Speaker 1: So then, okay, so he [Edward Hunter, husband] passes away.  But you--do you immediately stop performing at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He died in March, and my contract was up in May, and I didn't sign another contract.  And they came after me to come back... come back.  I said, "No, no, I made a promise.  And if I give you my word, I'm going to keep it."  And I, the memories of him... I didn't go back.  I never regretted it; I never regretted it, because I fulfilled myself with other things.  I knew that I... I had a feeling that I could do something else.  And it's something that I wanted to do, I wanted to be stationary.  I felt that I had something in me that I could give to people, give myself to others.  And I think that I have done that through the years.
Speaker 1: Was there anyone that you--who was advising you at the time that you looked up to?  Or, you know, who you wanted to be like, that you had sung around?
Speaker 2: Like... no...  As a singer, I loved Adley Hall, and she was tremendous; I used to try to imitate her.  But no, I had my own identity.
Story_ID: 60064
Speaker 1: Now, so you decide to go--is that when you get the job with the Social Security Administration?  Or, how--
Speaker 2: When I was working at the--when they put in the blacks on 125th Street and I got the job working at the 5 and 10 cents... Woolworth's... that was when they first put blacks in there.  I was in school, and every Saturday I would be, I would take exams.  And civil service, that was the best jobs in those days.  You feel job security, and you may as well establish yourself if you're going to be out there.  And I passed the exams, and the job offered at that time twelve hundred and sixty dollars a year.  I said how can I take a twelve hundred and sixty dollar a year job after making the kind of money I'd been making?  And my girlfriend said, "Listen, civil service is one of the best things now for blacks.  Get into that, and you will get promotions, and you can always go up the ladder."  But the job was in Baltimore [Maryland].  So, I had to leave New York [New York City, New York], go to Baltimore.  But fortunately, when you were there about two months, you get an increase in salary--$1440.  Then you get $16-something; then you go to $19-something, and $2,000.  Your increases came pretty rapidly.  And I went up the ladder, until finally I got a transfer back to New York, after being there about nine months.  And then I kept taking examinations and going to school.  I was promoted, got promotions from a grade... from a... what was that... a keypunch operator, to becoming one of the executives in Social Security... representatives.
Speaker 1: So, you were living in Baltimore during this whole time?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, yes, for nine months that I worked from--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: See, the appointment, the civil service appointment was in Baltimore.  And I stayed there for about nine months.
Speaker 1: And then you moved to--
Speaker 2: Transferred back to New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, are you enjoying your single life at this point?
Speaker 2: I loved it, because I had loads of boyfriends.  (Laughter).  I enjoyed that very much, very much.
Story_ID: 60065
Speaker 1: And you also decide that you want to go into business, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, what kind of business do you identify?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, when I was working at Social Security, I made my first investment in real estate.  And that was in 1950.  And I meant I had some money that I'd saved from Social Security.  I knew that I wanted--I'd get a much higher rate investing than I would leaving it in the bank.  So, I was introduced to Hope Stevens, who was a very prominent lawyer in New York [New York City, New York].  And he had a law firm, Dyer, Stevens and Murray.  And they--I made an appointment with them.  And I was told that he was very instrumental in helping people in business, and I made an appointment and I went to see him.  And he said, "Young lady, what would you like to do?"  And I said, "I'd like to be either a funeral director or in business."  And he said, "Well, that's interesting.  What kind of business would you like?"  I said, "Either a funeral director or a liquor store."  And he said in a very dignified manner, "Young lady, I can't for the life of me understand why you want to be in the liquor business."  And I very pithily said, "That's because you're a lawyer, and not a businessman."  Oh, he was taken aback.  He says, "You're very flippant."  But we became very good friends, and he helped me from 1942 to 1982 when he passed.  He helped me; he was my attorney, and helped me in the business.
Story_ID: 60066
Speaker 1: So, did you, why did you want to go in--I mean I want to get--but why did you want to go into the liquor business?  Why... did you ever think of owning a club yourself?
Speaker 2: Well, I had seen where many of the nightclubs ran by women were very successful.  But I didn't want that kind of communication with the public.  I wanted something that I could be in the background, I thought, and run it from that way.  I didn't want to be in the public.  So, I didn't want a nightclub.
Speaker 1: And what struck you about a liquor business?  Why, why that?  Why was that a view?
Speaker 2: It was very lucrative, and it was not overdone.  Because back in those days, you didn't just get a liquor store because you said I want to be in the liquor business.  Liquor...  New York State only had very few liquor stores at that time.  And you had to be very prominent, a politician, or somebody known, well-known, to get a liquor store.  They finally had a lottery, where you made an application, put your name in the lottery.  And they said the drawing would be held at a certain date, at a date.  And sure enough, I filed my application, and my number was 340-something.  The day the drawing came, I was just--oh, I was so anxious.  I didn't know I was going to be pulled, and sure enough my name came up.  But in the meantime you have to file an application, get all your papers in--they were very, very rigid about who filed, because they wanted to make sure... you had to prove yourself... make sure... tell them how you got  your money, where you got it.  And they didn't want the Mafia to be involved in it, so they made sure that you earned it, or you were able to save it over a period of years.  You just didn't get fast money and go into the liquor business.  And I filed the papers.  And I didn't have--but you must have a location.  So, I had a friend of mine who called me at my office at the Social Security [Administration] and said he had a building that I could buy.  And I said, "Oh, that's fine, I'll come right down."  I went down, and that was where I bought the building and put my liquor store in this building.  And the building next door became vacant, and I purchased that building.  And wouldn't you know when the lottery came out, my store and another store right next door to each other--the lottery was drawn for my store--my number and his number.  Because he had applied prior to my purchase of the building for a store in that building.  Well, when he found out, he moved across the street.  So, we didn't have that much competition.

Speaker 1: Now, with your real estate investments, talk about that a little bit.  What--you had identified real estate as a good area to go in, I take it, even before the--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Because I always knew that... get yourself some... Pearl Bailey sang the song, "Get Some Land."  I knew that getting some land would be an asset.  And it's something that I could do and wouldn't have to be there every day to work... constantly working it.  I could buy the property... what I did, I bought properties and refurbished them myself.  I tore out the buildings, gutted them, and made all complete new apartments out of them with complete bathrooms, kitchens, and living rooms and bedrooms.  And I managed the buildings myself.  And then I knew that it was, it meant something that I could hold on for years.  It wasn't an in-and-out business, like restaurants and little places like that, you know.
Story_ID: 60068
Speaker 1: Did you find though, that, you know, in the whole... I mean because that's a lot to take on, as a woman.  And did you find that you had trouble getting people to work for you?  Did you find that, you know, your first building... did you make money on immediately?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  The first building was a fabulous building in Brooklyn [New York City, New York].  This is, it was a building that was owned by Italians.  And it was set up on a little hill, and the marble steps came down.  It had marble, winding steps going up in the building.  And it was three huge apartments there, and the rooms were oh, very, very, large.  And I took that place and made them, each room, into fabulous studio apartments, and the apartments I rented out to families.  And the rooms I rented out to... it was down...  The building was located in downtown Brooklyn, and right near the municipal buildings and all that.  And I rented those rooms out to men who were policemen, firemen, and city employees down there.  And I kept that building for about a year.  And the only reason I let... I made money, made a lot of money, and a lot of good friends that I still have today.  And the only reason I got rid of it was because of the traveling back and forth, and working... still keeping my job at Social Security [Administration]... and going back and forth trying to take care of that building and take care of my social life, too...  It had become a little too much, then I started buying property in New York.  But that building bought me the second building in New York.  The second building bought me the third building.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So, you, what was it?  Oh, so you said the first... the first property helped you--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: --helped you... you financed it with... I mean financed your second property with your--
Speaker 1: With earnings and whatnot from my first properties, and what I was able to...  And I had accumulated, you know...  And each one would help me buy the second.  And we finally wound up with eight apartment buildings in New York City all at one time.  And it was--and then having the liquor store at the same time, trying to keep the job at Social Security... it was just too much for me.  I had to finally leave the job, and then I finally sold off each building, because it was getting--it was just too much for me--until I got rid of all of them.
Speaker 2: Now, you, you started with this--I just want to get some chronology straight.  You start with the Social Security Administration in '41' [1941], it says here.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And then what year did you buy your first piece of property?  You said 19--
Speaker 1: Nineteen Fifty [1950].
Speaker 2: Nineteen Fifty [1950], okay.  And then when do you open the liquor store?
Speaker 1: Nineteen Sixty-Four [1964].
Speaker 2: Nineteen Sixty-Four [1964], okay.
Story_ID: 60069
Speaker 1: So, when... it came... because you had already talked to Mr.--
Speaker 2: Stevens?
Speaker 1: Was Stevens your lawyer?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, you'd already talked to him.  And so, this is sort of a dream come true.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But would you describe the process of getting the liquor store?  I mean people don't--you just don't, you know, wake up and say I want a liquor store.  So, what was the process you went through?
Speaker 2: Oh, I told you that you have to...  See, you couldn't get a liquor store in New York [New York City, New York] unless you were very well-known, or you were a politician, or some big shot, you know.  And there were very few black stores at that time.  I think that maybe there might--I know Danny Burris had one; that's Dave Dinkins' [David Dinkins] father-in-law.  And two other fellows had one down, further down in Manhattan [New York City, New York].  I don't remember the name of the store.  But you had to--since everyone was applying for licenses and wondering why they didn't have them.  So, New York decided to have a lottery.  And that meant you fill out an application, put your name into a bowl, and they would pull out your number and issue you a license.  And this drawing was supposed to be--was held all at one time.  So, at that time I think they must have issued about a thousand liquor stores.  But it was all over the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, Queens, you know.  And I was fortunate to have my name pulled from that lottery.  And that's how I happened to get the liquor business.  But now, you just file your papers and then they inspect them.  Because you have to show them how you got your money.  You have to spell out everything.  They just didn't want--they wanted to know you didn't get your money from fast money or racketeering, or something like that, but that it was honest money.  So, they scrutinized you very, very seriously.
Speaker 1: So, you had--what you had really accomplished was that you had... you had already probably vested in your retirement with the Social Security Administration, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you, you had your income coming in from your property?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so with... I'm just wondering...  This is a different business, the liquor store business.
Speaker 2: It is that.
Speaker 1: I mean, you have to have relationships with the vendors, and things like that.
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: So I'm just wondering what the process was, or even the timeframe, when you decide, you know, you were going to apply... to even just stocking the shelves, you know, and having relationships.
Speaker 2: Well, you have to first of all have... let them know...  You have to have a place to put your liquor.  And when you file your application, you have to keep the...  You don't know how long you have to hold this place and pay your rent until the license is issued to you.  Fortunately, for me, I owned the business, so there was no hardship for me to keep my place in abeyance.  But and then when you open... they... the liquor...  The distributors know that you're opening.  So, you don't have to worry, they come to you.  And they really come to you, too.  You get so many salesmen out there trying to sell to you, that it becomes a headache sometimes.  And you want to be kind to all of them and give them all business, but you just can't do it.  So, you pick out your favorite ones and give them the... and then they start shipping your merchandise to you.
Story_ID: 60070
Speaker 1: And your store was located... it was called Julie Hunter's--
Speaker 2: Julie Hunter's Wines and Liquors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or Jewel Hunt.
Speaker 1: Jewel Hunt, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And it was located where?
Speaker 2: 127th and Lenox Avenue [New York City, New York], right on the corner, just a half a block from Sylvia's famous restaurant... famous soul food.  We became great friends, great friends.
Speaker 1: And you, so were you at the store a lot at the beginning?  You were--
Speaker 2: In the beginning I was, and I had my job at Social Security [Administration].  And I thought that I would hire very good help, pay them at good salaries, and that I would be able to do just the managing and the bookkeeping work of it behind the scenes.  But it didn't work that way.  It got to the point I had to leave my Social Security job, because it was too devastating for me.  It was, the hours were very long.  The store opened at 8 o'clock in the morning, and we closed at 12 o'clock at night.  You have two shifts.  And you have to have--even though I had good managers, I thought, it was something that I had to be there on top of it all the time.  Because when you're handling money, it's a little tricky.  It becomes luring to people, you know.  So I had... and even with my sharp eye, and trying to watch everything, it didn't work out.
Speaker 1: So, talk about what didn't work out, and what was actually going on.
Speaker 2: Well, my employees became my silent partners.  And I was buying... purchasing... more than I was selling.  (Laughter).  And consequently it... I... it became...  The hours were so long; it was 16 hours a day.  I got very little sleep, and I guess it just gave me almost a nervous breakdown.  And I became ill, got sick in the store, and tumbled off the stool.  One of my employees caught me.  And he said, "Miss Hunter, I'm going to call an ambulance for you."  I said, "No, no, no, I'll be alright."  But they rushed me back into my office and laid me there.  And all of a sudden, I had a nosebleed.  And well, they called an ambulance.  And they said had I not had that nosebleed I probably, I would have had a stroke or a heart attack.  But they rushed me to the hospital.  And the doctor said, "Miss, I don't know what you're doing, but you are under a tremendous amount of stress.  I would suggest you make some changes, and should make them right away."  Well, I stayed in that hospital overnight, and they dismissed me.  And I had a chance to do a whole lot of thinking.  I said, "Well, they've been after me to buy my store.  I think I'll try to sell it now."  Lo and behold, about two weeks afterwards, a gentleman came in and he said, "Miss Hunter, you want to sell your store?"  I said, "Yes" flippantly, and just kept walking.  "And I want X number of dollars, dollar for dollar for stock, and I want all cash," and just kept walking.  He looked at me like I was crazy, and just turned around and walked on out of the store.  So, about three or four hours later, he came back and said, "Miss Hunter, when can we go to contract?"  I was flabbergasted.  I said, "Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I have to see my lawyer."  And then sure enough he gave me his card, and we made a contract, and I sold the store.  I have never regretted leaving that store, because I'm alive today to talk to you.
Speaker 1: Because it was really too much on you.
Speaker 2: Very stressful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very stressful.
Story_ID: 60071
Speaker 1: So, you went back really to managing and owning your real estate?
Speaker 2: Yes.  By this time, I had sold most of my buildings anyway.
Speaker 1: Oh, you had?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had to get rid of them, because it was too much.
Speaker 1: Now, I want to ask, at what point and time are you becoming really a pillar of the community?  And you know, and well-known?  Is it, is it at the time you start owning property?  Is it--you know, and you had always really been socially active.  I want to talk about some of those things.
Speaker 2: It's when I became... when I bought property and it became known that I had buildings.  And people know you fixed up your properties decently, and I had very--always made the buildings very nice and beautiful.  I wanted my tenants to live like I lived, even today.  And it became probably known that I was in business.  And opportunities came for you through social links, and opportunities came through business.  So, that's how I got into helping under-privileged children and doing things for the community.
Speaker 1: And what, tell us about some of the activities and things that you were involved in.  Because this is really the fifties [1950s] and, you know, really... I mean hot during the fifties [1950s] and sixties [1960s].  And I just want to talk about it, because that's an interesting time period in Harlem and New York.
Speaker 2: Well, in the fifties [1950s], I wasn't in--when I was in business, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, you were in real estate then, right.
Speaker 2: Real estate, and I just strictly took... stayed with my business.  And I wasn't doing much socializing then.  But when... when was it?
Speaker 1: Sixty-Four? [1964]
Speaker 2: No.  After... no...  Yes, I joined the club--the first club I joined was the Continentals, and that was in, I think '59' [1959], or something like that.  And they were working for under-privileged children and fundraising.  And I enjoyed that, because they did quite... they did, and still do a lot for families and children who are needy.  And we have chapters all over the United States and the Virgin Islands.  And I think you've heard of the Washington [D.C.] chapter.  And they have a chapter in Chicago [Illinois], also.  A very, very, well-funded--
Speaker 1: Group.
Speaker 2: Group, yes.  Groups... I'd say groups.
Speaker 1: Groups.  Now who, how did this group differ from, let's say the Links?  Did it differ in sort of--?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know the activities of the Links, but I know that the Links is one of the most prominent clubs in New York City.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Story_ID: 60072
Speaker 1: Well, who were some of the members of the Continentals that we might know about?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know if you know Fannie Pierre.  She's deceased now.  She had a very--she was a nightclub owner.  Selbra Hayes, she was also very famous and a nightclub owner; Rose Morgan [HM] was the owner of the Rose Morgan [HM] Beauty Salon; Art Saches'wife... I think you know Betty Sache.  Art Sache was a big tennis player.  They were all women of... prominent women in New York, in the New York Continental Society.  And all over the United States... they were all doctors and lawyers and judges and whatnot.  Because that's the way they picked them.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, you also--but that's the organization, that's still around.
Speaker 2: It's still in existence.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Because... did you say it's all over the place?  It's--
Speaker 2: Yes, all over.
Speaker 1: I hadn't really heard of it.
Story_ID: 60073
Speaker 1: But some of the other groups you belonged to--they were the... you know--
Speaker 2: There's a group that I'm with now called The Group.  And we raise money for Negro College Fund and the Harlem School of the Arts.  And we, and I've been with them now about seven or eight years.  But they have been in existence for maybe fifteen or twenty years.  And they--we've been on this program, the Negro College Fund programs.  Every year we give them funds, and they--some members will go and present the money to them.  Now, once--the second Negro College Fund--second here--Rose Morgan [HM] and I gave a benefit for the Negro College Fund at the State Building here in New York [New York City, New York], which was well attended.  And all the celebrities came out.  And Eddie O'Jay and all... Reverend... Dinkins [David Dinkins, HM] and Congressman Rangel [Charles B. Rangel, HM], they all... all of them came out and supported us.  It was very, very successful.
Speaker 1: And what about the Bon Bons?  That's--
Speaker 2: The Bon Bons was strictly social.  But they had a lot of very prominent women in there; their husbands were very prominent.  For instance, there was Mrs. Basie, Count Basie's wife [Catherine Morgan].  There was Thelma Randolph, whose husband [Luther Randolph] owned the Shalimar [Lounge] here in New York [New York City, New York].  There was Hazel Sharp, who was one of the first black models in New York.  And Robinson, I can't think of her first name right now; she was married to a very prominent...  They were very, very distinguished women, you know, and handpicked women, I'd say, in this group.  But we were strictly social, and we gave fabulous functions, though, fabulous.
Story_ID: 60074
Speaker 1: And were you, you were--was your mother [Mary Staley Corbett] alive at this point and time?
Speaker 2: No.  My mother lived until 1976, I think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was around.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was--
Speaker 1: She saw...  So, what did she think of all your--
Speaker 2: Oh, she loved it.  Oh, the glory.  She was... and especially when I was in show business.  And I understand my--I never saw my father [Dez Corbett] after we left Florida.  But my brother [James Corbett] traveled quite a bit, and he went to Florida.  And when he would cut pictures out of the newspaper and take down to my dad.  And he was so proud, he'd take all the pictures around and show it to all of his cronies.  "This is my daughter, this is my daughter.  She's at the Grand Terrace," or, "She's there, she's there."  He was very proud of the fact that I was doing great in show business.  And my mother just, oh, she loved it.  And then I had the liquor store.  Naturally she... "Oh, my daughter, this is my daughter's store, you know, my daughter's store."  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 60075
Speaker 1: Because the one... I mean, besides you and Rose Morgan [HM], who were the other prominent sort of African-American women in business?
Speaker 2: Fannie Pierre, Mrs. Gumz, Inez Gumz.  She was another liquor... had a liquor store.  And Selbra Hayes... they were the...  A girl that had a salt and pepper shop, I can't remember... a nightclub... I can't think of...  Most of the women were in nightclubs, you know, that was what they were doing mostly.
Speaker 1: Right.  And how did you come...  Oh, go ahead.
Speaker 2: No, that's alright, I can--
Speaker 1: Go on.
Speaker 2: uh-uh.
Speaker 1: How did you come to know Rose Morgan?  How did you--
Speaker 2: I knew of her salon, because I would go there.  But I had no more than just as a customer.  And she was a member of the Continentals, and we became good friends.  And then we became travel companions, because the Continentals would go from city to city to these various conclaves.  And we became friends that way--roommates and traveling together.  And we had a lot of common, because being in business, we could talk about a lot of things and share things.
Story_ID: 60076
Speaker 1: And did you--and you say never... never held up at the store... no problems.
Speaker 2: Never had a robbery, never had a stick-up, never had a...  Even when the riots came, and the blackouts, the people in the community sat around and protected my store.  They just stood... held hands together, "Oh, no, don't touch this store.  This is our store."  And I guess I'd been very kind to people in the neighborhood, so they felt it was their store.  And they didn't want it destroyed, because it was a beautiful store... beautiful store.
Speaker 1: Now, how much were you making in those days?
Speaker 2: You don't tell those things.
Speaker 1: I knew you were going to say that was impolite.  But, okay, but it was profitable?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, it was very profitable.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you one thing.  When I closed my store, I had to pay a tremendous amount of income tax, because the business had gone down, because people was taking so much from me.  I'm selling so much, buying so much, but I'm not getting--the profits are not going into the cattle.  So when I sold my store, I had to give out thousands and thousands of dollars--I mean almost, I'd say eighty or ninety thousand dollars--because of the differences in what was reported and what was made, you know.  What can I say?
Story_ID: 60077
Speaker 1: Now, with someone coming along in business today, what would you advise them then?  And do you think you would have the same type of business if you were starting today?
Speaker 2: I would, yes, I would have a real estate business.  I don't know if I'd go back into the liquor business again, because it's too confining, too taxing.  But that's because big business has taken over the little business.  There used to be a lot of little mom and poppa stores, but they froze them out.  Because they got together--the distillers got together--and they owned the stores, and their families owned the stores.  They could buy cheaper than the little mom and poppa stores, because they froze them out.  Now, but if I had to go into business again, it would not be a liquor business.  It would be real estate.
Speaker 1: And what advice would you have for someone coming along?  Because you were really, you were a pioneer, really.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I would say make sure you know--this is what you want to do.  Know what you're doing.  Have enough capital to keep your business going successfully, and not go on a shoestring, hopefully.  And be there and manage your properties.  You've got to stay there and manage it yourself.
Story_ID: 60078
Speaker 1: And do you think it's a good thing for black people to do, to be in business?  Because you know, there was a lot--most people, you know, got government--I mean if they could, they would get government jobs.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know and that was considered, you know--
Speaker 2: The best jobs.
Speaker 1: --the best thing to do.  And it's really--you know, just recently, I mean really...  You know, and then it was--you know, get involved in politics; that was the way.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: It was just recently that you hear this discussion more about get in business.  But we've been in business for a long time as a race, but it's just now that people are talking about that even more.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I think it's a good idea to get into business, or go to work for the big corporations out there.  But how many corporate jobs can you get?  So, I think business.  I've seen more blacks being successful now in businesses, and the opportunities are opening up for them now to really make some big money.  So, even the restaurants...  There used to be just the little cracker box restaurants.  But they're opening fabulous restaurants now, and they're doing big business.  And the real estate business is still very good.  And--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: For blacks.
Speaker 1: For blacks?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And look now.  What do you think of the development that's occurring in Harlem [New York City, New York] right now?
Speaker 1: I welcome them... I welcome them.  I think it's, it's something to change our city.  I was coming home last night, and was admiring the changes that have been made from the time that I came to New York [New York City, New York], and now.  And it's really becoming a beautiful city again, beautiful.

Speaker 1: And you know-
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: --you had spoken of--I mean you were married actually one other time, and I want you to talk--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh.  (Laughter).  The charmer.  I married... 1960, there was a group called the Rinky Dinks.  There was a chapter in New York [New York City, New York] and a chapter in California--L.A., Los Angeles.  And the New York chapter asked the Bon Bons to go out to California to a conclave.  So, the next year, the New York chapter invited the California group to come to New York.  And they asked the Bon Bons, because we all were very good friends, to come out and help them meet the group coming in from California.  Well, they had a VIP room up towards, out of the airport.  And they--we also wanted some men, because it was some women coming in from California.  Well, my friend called and asked me would... could she bring a doctor friend of hers in another chapter.  I said, "Yes, we, the girls would be happy to have them come along."  And sure enough, they came.  And this evening, this gentleman spent more time with--the invited guest--spent more time with me.  And I enjoyed him, because he was a very charming man, and well-educated.  He had so many degrees, and I was very impressed with that.  And when it came time to go home, the doctor asked me to drop him off, because he had a previous appointment and had to leave early.  So I said yes, I would, and I dropped him off.  And he was very charming.  And the minute I walked to my door, the phone was ringing.  And here he was... he says, "Oh, I'm so happy that you arrived home safely.  Just checking to see."  And I thought that was very nice of him, and I was duly impressed.  So, then he asked if he could take me to dinner, and I agreed to that.  And then the next day, I received orchids at my office and, oh my, I was elated then.  Because, oh, I worked with--I was the only black in this office, and a lot of the ladies were impressed with this type of behavior.  And every other day, I'd get flowers, or roses, candy, or some sort of token showing some... paying me attention... paying attention to me.  And--
Story_ID: 60080
Speaker 1: Well, you were talking about your husband.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: You know, the second.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You were saying that--well, you were talking about having met him.
Speaker 2: Well, I met him in '60' [1960] in September; met him in September.  And we married--I met him in June, rather.  We married in September.
Speaker 1: But did you meet him out in California?
Speaker 2: No, I met him here in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Remember the girls were coming to New York--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he was invited out to the airport--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to help entertain the young ladies, but I wound up with him.  (Laughter).  And well, anyway he was a very brilliant fellow, very brilliant.  He was a perennial college boy, he never wanted to come out of school.  And he had a million degrees almost, because he stayed in school.  Every time we'd want to get him out, he'd register with another class, another class.  And when I met him, he was writing his thesis, but I don't know if he ever finished it, because he was...  (Laughter).  And he was a ram rod college boy, you know, loved to party.  And I was in business then and trying to take care of my properties--buying buildings and doing all the architectural work for it, drawing the blueprints and whatnot, and figuring out--and he didn't have that sort of mind at all.  All he wanted to do was party.  So, he said...  In the morning, I'd meet these contractors on my way to work at my job with Social Security [Administration], 8 o'clock in the morning.  I come back at 5 o'clock at night.  They'd meet... the contractors would meet me; there's no work done.  But at the end of the week, they'd ask for a five or ten thousand dollar payment for the payroll.  And this went on for a while, where I was being drained, and no work being completed.  I don't know what's wrong with those rascals.  They just do not fulfill their contracts when they make one with you.  So, I spoke to Jack, and I said, "You know, you'll have to do something about this.  Because... let me put you in an office.  There's a couch and a typewriter and a desk, and let you stay... just be there as a psychological matter, to let them know there's someone overlooking the job."  He said, "Okay."  But he said, "Oh, no.  There's nothing in my degrees that say that I should be associated with plumbers, contractors and carpenters."  I said, "Oh, Lord, look what I've got into now."  And I said, "I'm going to have to do something about this."  So I said, "Let me show you what I've got to do--all this debt."  So, we sat on this table and said... I laid out all the bills and what I owed.  And he said, "You owe all that money?"  I said, "Yes."  "How are you going to pay it?"  I said, "At this point, I don't know how."  He said, "Well, they're going to put you in jail."  I said, "No, they're not, because I'm going to get this work done and completed."  But I knew that he was not in my corner.  I mean he's in my corner, but he just didn't have the ability to conceive of this kind of work.  So then I thought about it, and I told him that we'd have to come to the parting of the ways.  And so, I told in December.  We met in June, married in September, and I told him in December that it had to end, and I had it annulled in March.  So, that was the end of that relationship.  But we remained friends all through the years, from 1961 until he died, which was about three years ago he died.  And wouldn't you know that rascal wound up a millionaire?  He had came into a lot, he got a lot of money.  So, he was very successful.  He was, he was a minister by the way, too--an ordained minister, and had a church over in Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: So, did he--and he gave up his partying ways, though?
Speaker 2: Yes... I don't think he ever gave them up.  I really don't believe... (Laughter).

Speaker 1: Now, you also talked about a trip that you made to California to Nat King Cole's house.  Or, you were the guest of Mrs. Cole?
Speaker 2: No.  We were the guest of The Rinky Dinks.  It's the same time we out to Rinky Dinks.  Mrs. Cole just graciously entertained us while we were there.  And she really did it graciously, and we had such a wonderful time.  One of our club members had this gorgeous place there.  And we had... that's when Count Basie came out, and Ray Robinson... Sugar Ray Robinson... and Sarah Vaughn--all of the big shots and elites for that.  Sammy Davis, we went to Sammy Davis' house that he had just purchased from Judy Garland, and it was just outstanding.  And we... he had a music room that's almost twice the size of my apartment.  And seemed like the bar was just as long as the music room.  And Dinah Washington played the piano and dragged her coat all over the... fur coat all over the place.  Sammy danced up and down the bar.  We just had a marvelous, marvelous time.  And I even took pictures of Mrs. Cole.  And Natalie [Cole] must have been about four or five years old at the time, and she was so awed by us adults there.  She just sat on the steps and watched us.  (Laughter).  It was a lot of fun.  She was, it was a lovely affair.
Story_ID: 60082
Speaker 1: Are there any other things you would like to, you know, talk about, you think, that I haven't touched upon?
Speaker 2: You mean in my early life, or something like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I can't think right now.
Speaker 1: Then let me ask you.  With... you have a love for New York [New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: And you said that once you saw New York, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] just wouldn't do.
Speaker 2: No way.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And what did you like about this, you know, about New York, and you know, basically what has become your home?  What is it that attracted you?
Speaker 2: Well, it's easy living in New York.  You don't have everybody in your business.  No one cares what you're doing and how you're doing it, you know.  And I like the opportunities that's here in New York.  I like... it's a live city.  It never, never sleeps as the song says.  And you can always...  You can be here alone and have something to do.  You don't have to have friends to be in New York.  You can live in New York alone; there's too many things--the museum, the theaters, the clubs, the restaurants.  There's always something to do in New York, and I like that type of thing... for that reason, rather.
Story_ID: 60083
Speaker 1: And with the people that you sort... you know, you've either observed or, you know, interacted with...  Are there people that you think have--and when I talk about this, I'm talking about, you know, black people, African-Americans--that have really made an impact on this, you know, on this city, or that you've particularly admired?
Speaker 2: A lot of the people that... I guess being in business, I admired the people who were successful in business.  They're the ones that are in my...  And I admired the people who were in the theatre, too.  I admired them--what Marian Anderson did, and what Lena Horne, what Bill Robinson did.  It was just, all these people were very inspiring to me.  What Rose Morgan [HM] did... I mean it just seems... I saw success in New York.  It probably could be the same thing in any other city, but I saw it here, that's where I saw it.
Speaker 1: Now, who were the business people besides Rose Morgan that you knew?
Speaker 2: Fannie Pierre, and she had the Don Casino.  And Selbra Hayes... I don't remember what Selbra Hayes' name was.  And Mrs. Gum, Inez Gums [ph.], she was very prominent.
Speaker 1: What did she do?
Speaker 2: Women... she had a liquor store, a liquor state.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, you said that.
Speaker 2: Now, the men... I admired Mr. Stevens because he was a very, he was my attorney.  He was just to me a righteous man.  He... everything strait-laced with him.  It had to be right, or he didn't touch it, you know.  That's the impression I had of him.  And I admired Adam Clayton Powell, and I admired Reverend Calvin Butts [HM], I admired him.  And I guess others I just can't think of at the moment, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, Bill Hudgins--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You were with real estate with him, right?  But he, did he--
Speaker 2: He was the president of the Freedom National Bank.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was very, very inspirational in helping me in my business.  Because you know, the business is built on money, borrowed money.  And he was very helpful and instrumental in helping me through loans from the banks and things.  He would talk... he was helpful, and I do appreciate what he did for me.  And his wife and I are good friends now, we play bridge together.  He's retired and living in Florida now.
Speaker 1: Anyone else?
Speaker 2: I'm just, I can't think right now.
Speaker 1: The others would have been younger.  I mean you had interaction with David Dinkins [HM], he's younger.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Percy Sutton?
Speaker 2: Oh, I know... but I know them all, but I never had too many business...  And David, I've known since a little boy; he lived in the same building here.  And we all moved in the same time.  And his children were born in this building, both of his children.  You know, I have more of a relationship with David than I...  And Charlie Rangel [Charles M. Rangel, HM], too, and his wife, I'm very friendly with them.
Story_ID: 60084
Speaker 1: Now, is this building sort of historic, or has a--
Speaker 2: Well, this building is, was one of the first black buildings that was built for Mitchell-Lama, I think, in New York [New York City, New York] about 1946 or '47' [1947].  But they started it, and people started moving in in '47' [1947], '48' [1948].  And I've been here now since 1948, and it's a little place.  You say, why do you stay here?  Well, it's relatively safe, and it was owned by the Metropolitan Life Insurance.  And they sold it to blacks, and somehow or the other...  It was rumored that they sold it to blacks.  And now it's--they sold it to someone else, and it's owned now by a different firm.  And I don't know what name--they operate under the name of Rubloff and Associates, Inc.  But people have been here for years and years, then move out.  Then everybody's had that craze to move to the suburbs.  They all moved out, and now they're trying to move back in.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, and so you never lived in the building that was yours?
Speaker 2: Never.  I don't want to live around my tenants.  (Laughter).  No, that's not good business.
Speaker 1: [Off-Camera, Larry Crowe] I have a question.  Did you know Dr. Channing Tobias?
Speaker 2: I know of him.
Speaker 1: [Larry Crowe] He was Jamaican.
Speaker 2: Yes, I know of him, I don't know him personally.
Speaker 1: [Larry Crowe] He was the chairman of the Y [Young Men's Christian Association].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: [Larry Crowe] Okay, or John Jackson?
Speaker 2: John Jackson, I don't think so.  Are you a New Yorker?
Speaker 1: [Larry Crowe] No, no.
Story_ID: 60085
Speaker 1: So, what I want to--I usually end with a question about your legacy.  And I would like to know what you would like to have as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I just hope that I've lived so that others will see my good works and glorify me when I go to Heaven, and I can leave that.  And I hope that I've done some good to help someone along the way, and be an inspiration to others to achieve as I have.  So, I have so much to be thankful for.  I've been blessed.
Speaker 1: And what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: My charming self, my personality, my love for the people, my... bringing people together.  I like bringing people together and doing good for others, I like doing that.  I'd like to be remembered for doing that.  And remember me for setting the pace for them to achieve and try to be successful in life.
Story_ID: 60086
Speaker 1: And do you have hopes, concerns, for black people, I mean in the future going forward?  Do you have--you've covered--you know, you've spanned a great, great period of time.
Speaker 2: Yes, I see a great future for blacks.  First, because they are preparing themselves now.  They're going to school, becoming educated, and knowing their craft, and that is important.  And you see more successful people.  And like the younger people are getting into big businesses and buying homes and developing families... I see that.  And I'm very proud of that fact, very proud.
Speaker 1: And any concerns?
Speaker 2: Who's going to--I don't have any close, close relatives, just my cousins.  I mean I don't have any children, unfortunately.  So, I have to be concerned about my cousins as my loved ones, my relatives... as my relatives.
Story_ID: 60087
Speaker 1: And one last question.  If you had your life to live over again, would it be exactly as you have lived it, or would you do something differently?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I would follow most of the pattern, but would do it maybe in a more glamorous way--fashion or something, you know.  (Laughter).  But I don't, I have no regrets, no regrets.  All those things--good, bad, or indifferent--that I encountered were all blessings to me, and stepping stones for my success.
Speaker 1: Isn't that a wonderful testament, to have no regrets.
Speaker 2: I have no regrets.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.  Okay, well, thank you.  We're going to do your photos now.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Story_ID: 60088
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a picture of me taken on an Easter Sunday in my Easter finery.  A friend of mine who is a caterer--and he cooks good soul food--always had a lot of people in his house.  So this Easter Sunday, I decided to go visit him.  And Wanda Cole was there, Mrs. Bernstein, the Hammersteins, Florence Henderson--they all came to his house for parties and whatnot.  He gave some fabulous parties.  Basil Thomas, everybody knows him.  "The Evening of Elegance," he started that years ago.  It all was done for the Fair Share Fund.  We helped him raise funds for the Fair Share Fund.
Speaker 2: And what year do you think that was?
Speaker 1: That was in, in the fifties.  I don't know which year, but it was in the fifties... fifties and sixties.  I don't know what year this is, because--
Speaker 2: That was you.  That was the Kappa--?
Speaker 1: It was Kappa Carnival, but I don't know which year, which year.  I know it was one of the Kappa Carnivals;  This picture was taken, it was a very social club.  The Kappa--it was not social--it was fraternity rather--Omega Kappa Carnival.  And everyone dressed up in costumes, to come to this fabulous affair that's held every year near Thanksgiving.  And this is the way I dubbed myself, in this outfit.  Looks like I was in show business then.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But I never, didn't have to wear costumes like that in show business.
Speaker 2: You didn't?
Speaker 1: No, because I was--even when I sang in the--I was also singing, had my own act in the show.
Speaker 2: So, you wore long dresses?

Speaker 2: Okay, like the one that you have on?
Speaker 1: Yes, uh-huh.

Speaker 1: Do you remember when and where this--
Speaker 2: Yes, this was taken at a club down at 55th and Broadway.  And it was Sarah Lou's birthday, I think, the reason why she had her close friends in to visit.  The club is no longer there now, though.  That's, that must have been 19... in the 1960s... in the sixties... in the sixties, in the sixties.
Speaker 1: Very good.
