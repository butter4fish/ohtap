 Gill. Today is February 20, 2010 and I   m visiting with  Pat Adams in her home here in Dallas, Texas. This interview is for the  O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Pat, thanks for taking time to visit with us this morning and  for your hospitality, inviting us into your home.  Surely.  Let   s talk about you a little bit and then we   ll come back and talk about  the Adams family. Can you tell me a little bit about your early life, about  where you grew up?  I grew up in Enid, Oklahoma. My dad was an attorney, my mother was a  housewife. I guess that you   d call it an idyllic childhood. My parents  were loving and caring. Everything was just so normal. It was  wonderful. Looking back, I appreciate that very much.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  I have one sister that   s four years older and we   re very, very close.  What   s her name?  Mary. Mary Margaret is what we called her when she was younger and  she married a Mattingly so Mary Margaret Mattingly was too much of a  mouthful.  Did Mary go to Oklahoma State as well?  She went a year and a half and she developed   she had a terrible cold  and they thought it might be tuberculosis so she went to a sanitarium.  Later on, since tuberculosis leaves scars, they determined that she never  5  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  did have it but she was the queen of everything and it was a shame.  Meanwhile she met her future husband and never did get back there,  which is a shame.  Can you tell me a little bit about when you were growing up, were there  any high school activities you were involved in, community activities?  I was in a choir   a little sextet that we sang in various civic groups and  so forth. I had quite a lot of illnesses when I was in high school. When a  dear friend of mine mentioned her memory is so much better she said,     Well, you were sick half of the time.    So I wasn   t able to participate in,  like the drum and bugle corps was the big thing then. But I really wasn   t  able to. I did some debating. We took expression lessons in those days,  so we performed in that capacity and that   s about it.  You said your older sister had gone to Oklahoma State. Did that  influence you to enroll at Oklahoma State?  Oh, yes. She loved it and I visited her when I was in high school and that  was just it. The rest of my family had gone to OU  University of  Oklahoma  so that didn   t sit too well with them. We didn   t care. We  loved it.  What year did you enroll, Pat?  1944. That   s when the WAVES  Women Accepted for Volunteer  Emergency Service  and the WACS  Women   s Army Corps  had taken  over all the dormitories and the fraternity houses. At least the sorority  houses were spared. (Laughs)  Where did you live?  The Kappa Alpha Theta house.  So you were a Kappa?  Kappa Alpha Theta, so Theta.  And your major, Pat, was what?  A business degree. I was aiming toward sociology and a psychology  minor. They didn   t actually have the major that I wanted which was  more testing people for jobs and that type of thing, so that   s the closest I  could get.  Do you remember any of the faculty there that were perhaps helpful to  6  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  you or mentors for you?  Oh, I do. Dr. Foreman, I just loved him so. He was my psychology  professor. Of course B.B. Chapman, I think everybody in this part of the  Southwest knew him.  History 101?  History 101, that   s exactly right.  What was his expression,    History 101 is fun, fun, fun     Isn   t that one of  his sayings?  People took that for a sure    A.    (Laughs) And I had a wonderful French-  Canadian man (I don   t remember his name) that taught geography. The  professors, I thought they were wonderful. I loved my education there.  Were there any organizations other than Theta, your sorority, that you  were involved in?  I was in Pan-Hellenic and one of the business sororities. I was president  of my chapter   a Theta chapter my last year.  So you were president of your sorority then?  Yes.  Were there some favorite hangouts, student places that you frequented at  that time?  Well, as Bob said, Swim   s and, of course, that was totally opposite of  where I lived and nobody had cars; we walked. That   s when I learned to  drink coffee because you would take anything hot. I cannot think of the  name of it but there was a little house right in the middle of the sorority  section and they had the most wonderful hot chocolates. I remember  that. It was right next to the drugstore. But anyway, those were the  hangouts.  Was the old Y Hut still there? That would have been north of where the  Student Union is now. Of course, the Student Union wasn   t there but the  Y Hut, do you recall that?  I don   t.  So what year did you graduate?  7  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  1948.  Because I remember a little bit of the story that Bob was sharing with us.  You met Bob, then, when he came back from the war.  Came back from the big war, yes.  It was the Fall of    47?     47, Yes.  Is there a story about how you met?  Well actually I was going with a good friend of his and the Beta house  was just about half a block from the Theta house. One day I looked up  and here was this good-looking guy in a grey flannel double-breasted  suit. At that point, hardly anybody even had suits. It was right after the  war and you could hardly buy suits. And right there is the best looking  thing I had ever laid eyes on. (Laughs) So we got acquainted   even  though he stood me up on our second date because he overslept. I  forgave him. (Laughs) The rest is history.  When did you first start learning about Bob   s family ties, with his dad  being in the first graduating class?  Actually, that was a non-factor because he didn   t advertise that. As he  said, he wanted to do it on his own. I did meet his father; we borrowed  his car one weekend, two couples went up to Pawhuska. I met him  because we were a little bit late getting back and he was pacing in front  of the Theta house waiting for his car. After Bob graduated, he had a  stroke about that time and he was in a nursing home. Since Bob wasn   t  there, I visited him a number of times and got to know him fairly well.  He never was able to function much after that. That   s really all I knew. I  might have known vaguely about the first graduating class, but not much  was made of it at that point.  Did you get to know his father fairly well when you were visiting with  him? What do you remember about him?  Not well really, he was too ill at that point. I was glad that I got to meet  him and he was in good health but it was not exactly a good situation  when we were late with the car. That was just a meeting and that was  about it. I   m sorry I didn   t get to know him better, but of course he was  pleased that I came to visit him.  He died in 1950?  8  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Yes.  But he   d had a stroke about a year before that, is that right?  A couple years before that. About three years, I guess. He ended up  going to live with Bob   s brother and his wife in Oklahoma City about  the last six months to a year and he died there at their home in 1950.  Can you tell me about the real Bob Adams? What are some things about  him that most people outside the family wouldn   t know?  Well, I think they all know the fact that he   s extremely outgoing.  Everybody just loves him   his personality plus. For instance, he plans  trips for our Sunday school class. Has planned many, many trips and  they all just love it. He   s an organizer.  A people person, isn   t he?  Very much a people person. That   s why he always wanted to be in sales.  Can you share a little bit of information about your life together? Bob  shared some but I   d like to get your perspective. You were married in     48     Married in    48. We immediately, after about six months he got this job  that he loved with Dodge Brothers. They   d never taken anybody nearly  that young. He talked his way into it and we went to Amarillo and loved  being there. I feel very blessed because we   ve had such a, what I  consider normal life and blessed life. He   ll have me crying here in a  minute. I feel very fortunate.  Tell me about the girls a little bit.  Oh well, the pride of our lives. Our oldest daughter, Katy, was born in  1950. When it came time for her to go to college, she was planning to go  to Texas Tech and had a roommate picked out and all that. We went up  to a Homecoming and took her, at OSU, of course. We were thumbing  through some of those carousels that they had, old pictures and history  and so forth. I think it came out at that point that her grandfather was  one of the first persons to enroll at Oklahoma A M. At the very last  minute she changed her mind. She said,    There   s just too much history  here. I want to come to Oklahoma A M.    So she did.  Was Bob excited about that?  Oh, yes. We both were very pleased. I love to tell the story that Bob tells  9  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  often, that this Texas girl went to Oklahoma to school, married a fella  from New Mexico and moved to Idaho. (Laughter) She married Johnny  Gates who had gone to OSU. And she has now our first great-granddaughter.  That   s exciting.  She and Johnny had three children and the oldest boy has the great-granddaughter.  Did some of Johnny   s kids go to Oklahoma State University?  No, none of them went to Oklahoma State because they were raised in  Boise, Idaho so they had no knowledge other than   they came to a  reunion or two with us when we had these nice honors for Bob   s dad and  uncle. But other than that, they just had no connection.  Pat, speaking of connections, Bob has shared some of his thoughts, but  from your perspective, how special is it to Bob and the family about your  ties historically with Oklahoma State, with the Land Run? Is that  something you talk about? Is it a point of pride with the family?  Frankly, when we were first married, we moved a lot and we were not in  close proximity to Stillwater so that was kind of on the backburner. But  since we   ve been back in Dallas and have had all these   well OSU   s  been wonderful to us in honoring the first two fellows, so it   s just meant  more and more and more as oftentimes I think things like that do as you  get older. Bob   s been influential in getting several young men to go to  OSU. He was honored by his fraternity several years ago. It   s just  become a big wonderful part of our lives.  Backing up a little bit, Bob is probably too modest to mention this, but  what are some recognitions and some honors that he   s received during  his career that you can recall?  There   s a business organization associated with his being a  manufacturer   s rep and he was president of that.  It   s a national organization?  Yes, a national organization. He was honored by Beta   s several years  ago.  You mentioned helping organize Sunday school classes?  He   s been president of the Sunday school class. Yes, we   re very active  10  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  in our church.  What   s your church?  Highland Park United Methodist Church, here in Dallas.  A very well-known and large church, isn   t it?  Oh, extremely   second largest in Methodism in the United States. We  just dearly love it. He   s been extremely active in our Sunday school  class and in other activities in the church.  Are there any other organizations or activities that you can recall that  he   s been involved with?  You mean like civic? No, by virtue of his traveling during our early life  and most of life in Dallas, it kind of precluded him being able to do too  much of that type of thin. I was always so pleased, because we   ve  known other men who traveled and on Saturday they would go out and  play golf but he never did because he wanted to be with his family.  That   s great. Bob   s uncle Arthur had passed away before you met Bob.  What do you remember hearing, stories about him? As you said earlier,  he was very close to his uncle Arthur. What do you remember about  what he said and others have said about Arthur?  I think his children and grandchildren are a product of that because they  all just adored him and they turned out so well. He was just a wonderful,  ideal influence for them. I   m just very sorry I didn   t get to know him.  Speaking of getting to know him, Bob told us a little bit about that first  reunion at your property in Angel Fire, which by the way must be a very  beautiful property. That   s a beautiful area.  It is. It   s very pretty.  So what was the impetus for getting the group together, that centennial  commencement, you being at OSU? Is that why Bob decided to initiate  that first reunion?  It is and I   ll add a few details to that instance. The three children     Girardi are their names. They were children of Walter   s sister, Nina, and  her husband. They were dressed in period costume. All of this, we were  sort of taken aback. We didn   t realize it was going to be such a  wonderful celebration. It was on television, I understand. It was lovely.  Then afterwards, as we say, on the floor, Walter and Diane and Walter   s  11  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  three sisters and their husbands were also there. We visited, and the next  morning Diane had a lovely brunch at their house and that   s when we  really got acquainted. Right then and there Bob said,    We shouldn   t let  this drop. We should continue this.    So when he had the dates set in his  mind he started sending out letters with questionnaires. The heading was  the picture of the four brothers. There were questions like,    Which  brother did so and so?       Which brothers were in the oil business?     Which brother did this and that?    Several of them told us later that they  really would kind of ignore that but it piqued their interest. I think he  sent out three or four, possibly, letters.  One brother Oscar, who only had one surviving relative, a  granddaughter who lived in San Diego, she said she didn   t think  anything of it, she had never met any us, but it just got her to thinking.  So she came and this has started friendships. For instance, one time  Walter, being a pilot, was stranded in Washington D.C. at Christmas. He  couldn   t get out, it was snowing so hard. So he called one of Jimmy   s  boys, as it happened, that lived in Rockville, Maryland, the minister, and  spent Christmas with them. Then the girl from San Diego has said,    I   m  very close to one of Jimmy   s son   s wives.    They both are very interested  in music. It   s just grown and expanded.  Who was the most interesting person at the Adams family reunion that  you got together at your home?  I think it was the nice women that came in the kitchen and helped me  cook. (Laughter)  You would remember that.  I would remember that. One story that   s sort of   not real cute, but I   ll  tell it anyway. Our daughter Julie was in charge of the entertainment. As  Bob said, one of the evenings they got up and were supposed to tell  something about themselves   the first reunion. Julie, one of her  questions,    Who   s been married the longest?    Well, of course it was  Bob and me. And the second, she asked Bob,    To what do you attribute  the longevity and pleasantries of your marriage?    And he said,    I just  say    Yes, dear.       (Laughter) So anyway, that   s just a little aside. We just  had a great time. People of all ages, they brought their children. Bob and  I were the oldest there, of course. Not entirely, but especially the last  one, we definitely are.  Pat, let me ask you this question. I   ve asked Julie a little bit also, but out  of the four brothers   there   s Walter and Arthur was second and Oscar  was third then James Homer. Which brother had the most  descendants   attend  the reunion ?  12  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  You   d have to ask Julie about that. I   m not real sure. It should have been  Jimmy with five children   Jimmy   s family. His wife was there. Jimmy  wasn   t able to be there.  Now the reunion is about the Adams family, not just OSU of course, out  of that you sort of had a sub-reunion of OSU people a part of that as  well.  Well it would either be our family, Bob   s and mine, probably and  Jimmy   s family probably would have been second. Of course, we knew  those children. Of course, just the one from Oscar. Oscar was the least  known, I think, of any of the brothers.  Was that the girl that was out in San Diego?  Yes, because Oscar just had three daughters and just one of them  married, and she just had one daughter.  I   m sure that there were some new stories, new people you met and new  stories. What were some of the favorite stories you heard at that first  family reunion?  Oh, my. Well, like I say Bob   s answer to Julie   s question was probably  the best. Oh, I think Johnny, Johnny wouldn   t want me telling this   or  Katie wouldn   t. Our daughter Katie   s husband Johnny, they were asked  well how did they meet? As a football player, he was invited to her  sorority house and that   s how they met. They started dating and he said,     Well, how we fell in love is because Katie could cram her whole fist in  her mouth, and now who would turn down a deal like that?    (Laughter)  But you know the various stories, like Jerry, for instance, had not  married until late. His wife Karen had been married and had two  daughters. We were all just overjoyed. He was a wonderful young man.  He married and then they had a daughter. He died quite young of cancer,  which was a shame.  Pat, what do you take away from the historical significance of the  Adams family? To you, you married into the family, you   ve looked at the  history of the family and now you know some of the people. Is it special  to you and in what ways is it special, the Adams family?  It   s very special, even though I wasn   t one of the Adams    at that point,  because I think each and every one of them have great pride in this. I  applaud the University for being so kind to the Adams family and  pointing out the history and all these brothers being the first graduates  and so forth. We get together more now and it   s always through OSU.  13  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Looking back, kind of changing the subject, but with Bob again, he  seems to have a special feeling about Oklahoma State University and the  sense of history and place and yet interestingly enough, his relationship  with his father was   his father and mother got divorced when he was  young so he was raised by his mother. What kindled his interested in  Oklahoma State University when he was growing up? Was it more his  dad or was it more Arthur or what?  When he was young? Well the fact that his dad had been there and  several cousins, cousins that he really enjoyed. His dad, of course, loved  OSU. There just simply wasn   t ever any question. In fact, I   ve heard him  say,    My life started when I went to Oklahoma A M.     When he enrolled?  Yes, because high school had been a little difficult since his parents were  divorced and he didn   t really see a whole lot of his father, although he  would take him out to the New Mexico property in the summertime. He  was definitely present in his life, but that   s why he doesn   t have too  many memories because they weren   t together that much.  So this was Oscar that had claimed the land in New Mexico, is that  right?  Arthur actually claimed the land in New Mexico. But apparently Oscar  was in very poor health and so they got together and decided that Oscar  would go to New Mexico for his health. They built a guest lodge and  Bob   s dad would take him out there in the summertime quite often. And  some guest houses   very rustic but we took our daughters out there  many times; it   s a beautiful place.  Was it Arthur that built the lodge?  I think Oscar did. And then Oscar   s   well they did have another  daughter, Nina, and she loved the place so that after Oscar and Minnie,  his wife   s death, Nina took over and she and her husband continued the  property and the guest homes     It was Arthur that originally homesteaded the land there.  That   s what we understand.  Was it a land run or a land lottery or something?  I don   t know about that. I don   t know how that came about. But of  course he was looking after his brother, had to send him out there for his  14  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  health, which was very beneficial apparently.  Pat, is there anything we   ve left out from your perspective that we  should talk about, about the Adams family, something special that you  remember? We talked about the dedication ceremony at the Adams  Market, the paneling on Cowboy Genes, OSU families; the lead family  in the panel was the Adams family. In recognition we had the  reenactment of the first class presentations. Is there anything we left out  that you   d like to mention or talk about?  No, I just feel privileged to be a part of it; an inadvertent part, I guess  you might say. We   ve just grown to be so close, the Adams family. You  know, before, branches of the family didn   t even know each other.  That   s been brought about by OSU itself, by presenting these various  honors. It   s been my privilege, because I just love them all, too.  Pat, I appreciate you taking the time to visit with us.  I   m happy to do so.  -------  -------
