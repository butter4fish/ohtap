Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers, our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Daniel Texidor Parker, D-A-N-I-E-L, and Texidor is T-E-X-I-D-O-R, and Parker, P-A-R-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 6, 1941, Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story behind the name Texidor?
Speaker 2: Well, at, at first take my father was from Puerto Rico and in that Latin culture they used to use the middle name as the family name, and he was William Texidor, and so being the elder child they named me Daniel Texidor.  Now, as far as Texidor the name itself I don't know the origin of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was your, your father's last name but did you, is, is Parker then your mother's last name?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: --his name was William Texidor Pacheco, and he changed the Pacheco to Parker [William Parker].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And, sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).  Let's see, what is it?
Speaker 1: I think it's--
Speaker 2: December 14th?
Speaker 1: No, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or is it the 16th?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I missed a couple of days.  December 16th, 19- 2006.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in Chicago, Illinois, we're at 4716 South Ingleside [Avenue] in my home.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It's actually 2009 [December 16, 2009].
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Two thousand nine [2009].
Speaker 1: Yes, it is, right.
Speaker 2: What did I say?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh, 2006.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: You sure did.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, I'm sorry, I didn't catch that myself.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm living in the past (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I must be too.
Story_ID: 638409
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions that management compels me to ask of everyone and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, it may be orange.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Nassau, Bahamas.
Speaker 1: And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, there are so many of them.  I, I can't think of a favorite one right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I saw 'Invictus' the other day and, "I am the captain of my faith [sic.], I am the captain of my soul."  And I remember we did that when I was pledging and it's, it's a strong kind of conviction so, I believe all men show, are captains of their faith and their soul.
Speaker 1: This, that, that poem ['Invictus,' William Ernest Henley] does seem to be a favorite amongst African Americans.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That my brother memorized it from high school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They had to memorize it when he pledged Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, one of my teachers used to recite it all the time, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, black as "--the night that covers me / Black as the pit from pole to pole, / I thank whatever gods may be--" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) "Gods may be / For my--"
Speaker 1: Yeah, they--
Speaker 2: "--unconquerable soul."
Speaker 1: Now, it would be interesting for somebody to do some research on why black people find that so compelling.
Speaker 2: Well, I think the fraternities all of them sort of used that almost as a mantra because the power in it attests to the, what they have to go over to cross the burning sands, you know, and so, and it's positive.  It's a good mantra to have.
Speaker 1: I, I wonder if the white fraternities use it as much, I just don't know.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 638410
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's, your mother's side of the family and your father's [William Parker] side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Maiden name or?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, A- Annie Lee Clark, A-N-N-I-E, capital L-E-E, C-L-A-R-K [Annie Clark Parker].
Speaker 1: All right.  And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Vicksburg, Mississippi, May 20th, 1908.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?  Are there any stories that are passed down or any remarkable individuals that that are remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all her parents [Lillie Clark and Wiley Clark] died when they were young.  There were eight of them and their parents died when they were young and their oldest brother had to raise them.  And so the oldest brother really became the fa- father figure.  They, she remembers her grandfather more than her father.  As with many blacks there were intermingling and she, she remembered the grandfather was an old Indian [Native American] and he, he used to smoke a pipe all the time.  And she said he would say very little.  But she would often--she had red hair and, and that was very unpopular then and she would say how she would take the, the coals from the fireplace and rub it over her hair and, and to make it black.  And she would have stories like that that she would tell.
Speaker 1: That's, you know, peer pressure, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Red hair.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: That's--so did she talk about going to school and what it was like?
Speaker 2: Well, when they went it was in one room, my Aunt Harriett [ph.], which was the oldest, would often talk about when they did go they had to go to one room and walk quite a distance.  My, their younger sister, my Aunt Mazie [ph.], they all were in the class and it was kind of strange all these age groups in one class but this is the way it was.
Speaker 1: Now what did they do for a living?  Did they do farming or?
Speaker 2: There it was farming.  But then when the brothers grew up one became a tailor, my Uncle Oscar [ph.], who we lived with up here, he was a carpenter--jack of all trades, carpenter, cement mixer, and I know that because many days I mixed the cement.  The one--so they were those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 638411
Speaker 1: Okay.  N- how old was your mother [Annie Clark Parker] when they made the move to Chicago [Illinois]?  Did she, and is there, are there circumstances around it that--?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, first they moved from Mississippi, from Vick- Vicksburg [Mississippi] to Memphis [Tennessee].  And Memphis is when they did the sundry kinds of occupations.  They, they did, my Uncle Henry [ph.] was a tailor for example, in Mem- Memphis he was a tailor.  My Uncle Oscar [ph.] came straight to Chicago and he started the construction kinds of things.  Eventually they all moved out of the South into Chicago and Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that specifically to follow the, the, the work?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, to follow the work.  And they were progressive people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they thought the, the city life up north would bring a better living, better quality of life.
Speaker 1: So do you know approximately when your mother, you know, moved to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Around '39 [1939].
Story_ID: 638412
Speaker 1: Can you describe your mother's [Annie Clark Parker] personality and what she did for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother's personality, oh, you know, I guess most children think their mom is a saint.  She was first of all a good human being, all the kids from the neighborhood would come to our house and particularly after church they would all come to our house.  And we didn't have that much but she would always manage to give them punch and cookies or whatever we had, my house would be the gathering place.  And she was a, a good woman.  She always saw the, she was, I think you would say an optimist because no matter how, no matter how bad the situation she would always find a way to make it positive particularly for her children.  So we were poor and didn't know it, you know, because our father [William Parker] was there and he worked and our mother was there.  When she did work she was a domestic but much of the time she would stay home and tend to us.
Story_ID: 638413
Speaker 1: Can you give us your, your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Okay.  William, W-I-L-L-I-A-M, Texidor, T-E-X-I-D-O-R, Parker, P-A-R-K-E-R [William Parker].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's after he changed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there a story about him changing it to Parker?  Did, did something happen, you know?
Speaker 2: No.  Actually when he, when he came here, initially, I think he embraced the Puerto Rican community but he ended up really embracing the black community.  And I think, you know, to have Pacheco [ph.], it kind of made him outstanding, but he was outstanding anyway; he spoke with a heavy accent.  I know when my friends would come over, they would say, "What did your father say? What is your father saying?"  I say, "He's speaking English," you know, but many times they did not understand him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: B-I-Y-O-M-O-N [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what date?
Speaker 2: October--he was the same as my mother [Annie Clark Parker], is, is the year, the date escapes me.
Speaker 1: But in 1908?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 638414
Speaker 1: What do you know about your father's [William Parker] ancestors and, or any stories about his family?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  For a long time we had a picture of his mo- mother, his mother, who was Herninez Pacheco.  And my mother [Annie Clark Parker] would write her, and that's the only means of communication we would have.  He left Puerto Rico when he was nineteen and came here to the mainland, they called it--to the United States they called the mainland.  And he was a laborer.  He didn't talk much about his life in Puerto Rico.  He did have a picture of his brother which I have here, Juan Pacheco, and he was a policeman.  And actually I remember Juan, I don't remember the idea of Juan because we always had this picture.  And one day, one day I went to Puerto Rico and they were marching in the streets on the (unclear), and I was saying what is this all about?  Well, the firemen was marching for increase in pay, and so I just took up a sign and I started marching with them.  It was in the era when we were marching here for so much for our rights and, and so I marched.  And I said, "Who organized this?"  And they said "Oh, an old man, Juan Pacheco, he organizes all of these things."  And I said, "Juan Pacheco?"  And so they said yes.  And, and so I said, "That's my uncle," and I asked them some questions and they said, "Yes, well, he's, he's gone back to Bayamon [Puerto Rico]," and I went there but I missed him and I, I wrote a note to him that I was there, but I did not hear from him.  So that's much of the link I have.  I wondered why I was so, I protest so much and, and I see where I got that from, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That, that's interesting that he was there and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --still in Bayamon.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 638415
Speaker 1: So your, your father [William Parker] didn't really have a story as to why, why he left, he was just following work or?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't, but I, I suspect that the promise that there was work here, you know.  My father--and, and in, in, in, in Puerto Rico, they try to say there is no race problem but there is, he used to talk about it.  And of the siblings he was the darkest sibling.  And his grandmother raised him but the, but the other ch- siblings were raised by their mom [Herninez Pacheco].  And I suspect he kind of--outcast and came here in, in, in, in fact found work and married my mom [Annie Clark Parker].
Speaker 1: So you're saying that he was the darkest, that he was possibly maybe not related to, you know, fully to the rest of the family or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was raised by his grandmother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, also, we know with black people, with Puerto Ricans or African Americans, we come all shades.  In my family they're--we run the gamut almost.  Just the siblings, my brothers and my sister and I are many different colors and we all have the same mother and same father.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's interesting the, the way some Puerto Ricans identify themselves and some don't.  And, you know, you got Arthur Schomburg [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg] who founded the Schomburg collection [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was a black Puerto Rican.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Dr. Ben [HistoryMaker Yosef ben-Jochannan] is a black Puerto Rican--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --historian.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, there's--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Gutierrez [Luis Gutierrez] always says he's an African, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: The Chicago [Illinois] politician from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Puerto Rican community.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So it's interesting.  I don't know, you know, as to, I guess, some say they're not, I guess, I don't know but it's--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, as one Puerto Rican told me and she was very light and blonde hair, she says there is no Puerto Rican.  All you have to do, no matter how light they are, is go back to the grandmother or the great-grandmother and you find the answer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're saying that there's probably African ancestry in most of the Puerto Rican--
Speaker 2: In 90 percent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  So was your father, I, he never went back you said to--?
Speaker 2: No, he never went back.
Speaker 1: You know, it sort of speaks to an alienation on some level.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And, and never talked about it too much.
Speaker 1: Now, well, there's probably no positive answer to this but you've heard of the great Johnny Pacheco, right?  The--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --the percussionist (laughter) and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --salsa--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --star?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Is there any relationship?
Speaker 2: No, there isn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: None that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  I thought I'd just ask.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, so he, so he, did he live in the Puerto Rican community or the black community when he came to the U.S.?
Speaker 2: Initially in the Puerto Rican community, but we were raised in the black community.
Story_ID: 638416
Speaker 1: This is an interesting question here.  How did your parents meet?  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Not really.  There was some dance during the war [World War II, WWII] because I was born in 1941.  They would have these dances and the, the, the, and, and my mother [Annie Clark Parker] and father [William Parker] they met there and the rest sort of as they say became history.
Speaker 1: Well, during the war was he considered a citizen?  Was he drafted or anything or--
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He wasn't.
Speaker 1: Do you think that that's the reason?  That he probably wasn't considered (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --a U.S. national?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  (Background noise) So they met and--this is during the war, so this is about, well, well, so this is 1941 then?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638417
Speaker 1: Do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I have (background noise) five brothers--four brothers and one sister.  I can first give you the names and--my brother next to me was Victor [Victor Parker], he is now deceased, and next to him is Joel, J-O-E-L [Joel Parker], and, and next to him is Christopher [Christopher Parker], and then comes my sister, Harriet [Harriet Parker], and finally the baby brother is Oscar [Oscar Parker].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Some are named for aunts and uncles, I suppose (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Exactly, exactly.
Story_ID: 638418
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' personalities and their talents and interests, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My personality, probably my mother [Annie Clark Parker].  My talents probably--I think my temperament, somewhat my father [William Parker].  At times he could be calm and everything but at other times we say his Puerto Rican blood would come forth and he would show his anger.  And so I think I'm a mixture of both of them.  In terms of creativity that part of me perhaps that came from my mother.
Story_ID: 638419
Speaker 1: With your father [William Parker] having this real distinctively different kind of heritage than a lot of the people in Chi- the City of Chicago [Illinois] in the black community--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --were there specific cultural things that were passed to you that you remember that are Puerto Rican, distinctly Puerto Rican?
Speaker 2: Well, not so much that distinctly Puerto Rican.  He, my father did most of the cooking and so when he would do a barbecue he would have it spiced up differently than most of the other kids' barbecue and they would love to come to our house to have barbecue.  My bro- my youngest brother is a chef and he was around my father a lot and so he likes to cook his food.  My brother, Joel [Joel Parker], often he does a Puerto Rican dish and invites us over.  So it's in the cooking that we find a lot of the heritage.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So I take it, it's your brother Oscar [Oscar Parker] that's the chef then?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, now, what did your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a laborer.  He worked in the stockyards.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, that, that's the, that was a, the, a job that thousands and thousands of black men coming to Chicago--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --took.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Work in the stockyards.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did he have, did things, how did things go for him?  Did he have to deal with union issues and struggles and--'cause I know that sometimes the whole union thing would erupt into a violent--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, I would get just tidbits of that.  He tried--he and my mother [Annie Clark Parker] tried to keep that away from the children as much as possible so we didn't know all of that part.  My brother, Victor [Victor Parker], was very close to my father and he often would, I remember on paydays go up to his job and they would go together and get food for the family and that kind of thing.  So he would be privy to more than the rest of us siblings.
Story_ID: 638420
Speaker 1: Where did you live?
Speaker 2: We lived, 51st [Street] and Wabash [Avenue], that's where we grew up.  Our Uncle Oscar [ph.], he was the one who raised them, and the one who my younger brother [Oscar Parker] is named for.  We, we, we, we were raised in his home, in his house.  And we went to Farren School [John Farren Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and down the street was DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And that's where we went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what were some of the--did you grow up the whole childhood in, over--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there at 51st and Wabash?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.  Some of the more memor- memorable times is on the holiday.  Our uncle was a carpenter, you know, and he would build this big wagon and everybody in the family would put food in the wagon and they would actually go to Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois], and we would go to Washington Park and celebrate.  And that was one of the festive times that I remember we had in the family.  Our uncle also put a barbecue pit, he built it in our backyard and we would have barbecues in the backyard.  When we did have time to play we would often play softball in the backyard, you know, and he would direct it.  Most of the time--because my uncle and aunt didn't have any children, so we kind of was, were their surrogate children and we would often have to, in those days they didn't have this great machinery to mix concrete and so we mixed the concrete and we knew how to put the, the rocks in and the sand in and the lime in and mix it, and we would go on jobs with him, jobs in the community and alongside of the community to do carpentry, cement mixing, plumbing.  I learned how to cut pipe and thread pipe and all of that, we had to do.
Speaker 1: So, so you were busy as a youngster (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  As a youngster I, because I was the oldest I didn't have as much time to do children kind of things.
Story_ID: 638421
Speaker 1: Now, did you--it, it strikes me that you may have been living near the projects when the projects were built?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were, we were.
Speaker 1: So did you actually witness the, the construction and--
Speaker 2: Yes, because we were on Wabash [Avenue] and the next street over was State Street and Dearborn [Street].  And so the complexion of the entire community changed when the projects were built.
Speaker 1: How did it change?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: And these are the Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Robert Taylor Homes.  And this is from the eyes of a, a young person.  You know, we would walk down State Street and Federal [Street] and all of that, and the houses might have been old and whatnot but the people owned them.  And there was a lumberyard that my [paternal] uncle would go to on 52nd [Street] and State and he would get all of his materials and whatnot.  And when the projects were completed, the (unclear)--lumberyard moved and so many of these kinds of things moved out of the community.  Now, at first the projects were very nice, you know, there really wasn't a problem.  But very soon elements arose in the projects that became unhealthy to the entire community in the form of gangs.
Speaker 1: Now, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask, I don't think--we, we see very few descriptions of what the, what they used to call in, in the day the Black Belt looked like, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --along State Street.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now what did it look like prior to the projects?
Speaker 2: Well, the Black Belt was a black belt in that it was lined with homes, but many people think negative of the Black Belt, but there you had shops that were owned by blacks and much of the black--the money of the black community stayed in the black community.
Speaker 1: So that, that's an important feature, yeah.  So the Black Belt featured black businesses?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a matter of fact, around the corner on 51st [Street] and Wabash my father [William Parker] would have an account with this store, Mr. Walters [ph.] was his name, and he owned a grocery store and that's where we did most of our grocery shopping.  And he would let us get things on credit, you know.  And then every Saturday my father would pay him and we would start the credit over again.  Well, this was giving credit to a black man, you know.  And the stores that lined the street were for the most part owned by blacks.  Now, the Jews came in and they began to, you know, infiltrate this, and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that after, after the projects were built basically?
Speaker 2: No, before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638422
Speaker 1: Now, I've heard other people say that--I think we, we interviewed Robert Taylor's daughter [HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at one point that the Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois], Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois] were, were, were as you said, fairly nice at first.
Speaker 2: They were, they were.
Speaker 1: And people there had jobs and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and--but what do you, having grown up over there, what did you see, see as the, the major contributor to the decline of the projects?
Speaker 2: I don't know if this was a major contributor or not but it certainly was a factor.  When the government didn't allow the black man to--they, they made it so that the black man could not stay in the projects, you know.  That only those women who were without husbands or mates and children could stay in the projects.  Well, that in itself caused a decline not only in, in the projects but in the family structure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It caused a marked decline in the family structure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was, was--what was the, I guess, I guess, a timeframe?  The projects were built in--about what year did they, did they come up?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see about in the '50s [1950s], in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's about the same time as the interstate highways.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  There was the plan it seems.
Speaker 1: It does, doesn't it?
Speaker 2: We in the black community feels that were--that it was a plan anyway.  And because all, all of it worked together to promote commerce for the larger community, but it's destruction for the black community.
Speaker 1: Now I think the name was urban renewal--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that, that was--that--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: --the name that they used the most.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 638423
Speaker 1: So well, tell us about you growing up.  I mean, what did, what did you like to do as a, as a young--you, you did a lot of work I know but--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what, what, what sorts of things were you interested in?
Speaker 2: Well, in growing up most of my fun life was centered around the church.  The church was right down the street, St. Mark [St. Mark United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois].  Then it was 50th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue].  And they had activities for us.  We actually--the pastor I remember so well, he introduced us to jazz and we didn't like jazz and, and I think he kind of felt bad because he had worked hard to, for us to get these tapes and, and we responded.  But as we began to listen to it, he began to impose it on us more and we began to understand that was part of our culture.  And when I grew up, we would go downtown and there was this jazz that we had heard when we were younger in church.  We did many things.  We would go down and hear--Orchestra Hall [Symphony Center, Chicago, Illinois] and hear Marian Anderson, you know.  It, it exposed us to a greater culture that we otherwise would not be exposed to.
Speaker 1: Now, now, your generation, you came along in the first rock and roll generation basically, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ye- yes.
Speaker 1: Chuck Berry and, and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I guess, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 638424
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that.  Did you have, I mean, who, who, who were your favorite musicians and who did you all like that, you know, kind of obscured any other, you know, any other music (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, actually, in high school [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] I remember we would rush home, rush home to hear the, the, the--let's see who, who were they?  The--
Speaker 1: The Platters or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: He--they would have these dance groups like 'Soul Train' but it pe- predated 'Soul Train.'
Speaker 1: Oh, it was a television program?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Local dance party type?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's, he's even popular now.
Speaker 1: Not Dick Clark, you mean?
Speaker 2: Dick Clark.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Dick Clark.  And he would have Dick Clark and--
Speaker 1: 'American Bandstand,' right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And it was, it was, it was interesting.  And then later on 'Julia' and these kind of programs came on.  I know I was young, I was twenty-one or two or something and I was teaching and that's when 'Julia' came on, on television.
Speaker 1: Oh, the sitcom.
Speaker 2: The [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll, sitcoms.  And my kids, my teaching kids, they would say, we would kind of talk about Corey [Corey Baker] and they would relate to him because he was the only little boy, little black boy on television, you know.  Oh--
Speaker 1: Do, do you remember when your family re- acquired its first television set?
Speaker 2: Well, actually we all would go downstairs and watch our [paternal] uncle's television because we have, had yet to acquire a television.  And it wasn't until much later for me until I was almost an adult that we had our own television and we didn't have to go downstairs to share in watching the television of my aunt and uncle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's a story that a lot of families have that somebody on the block had one, or some relative (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, somebody had one.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Right.
Story_ID: 638425
Speaker 1: Did you go to the movies and--
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to the movies.  We went to the Owl show [Owl Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] which, which was on 47th [Street] and I would take my siblings to the movies.  And when we really was going to--I was going to treat them we would go downtown to the movies.  And I, I remember 'West Side Story,' I took them to see 'West Side Story' because it was a play about, you know, Puerto Ricans and whatnot.  And they, they really enjoyed that, but they acted up and I told my mother [Annie Clark Parker] I wasn't gonna take them anymore, little kids were too bad, you know.
Speaker 1: What did your father [William Parker] think of 'West Side Story'?  Did he see it that you know of?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't see it.  He didn't see it.  And I'm sure to him it was, would be a joke, you know, it--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you had like, I think that, you know, basically except for a couple of the characters most of the Puerto Ricans were not played by Puerto Ricans, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Rita Mor- Rita--
Speaker 1: Moreno.
Speaker 2: --Moreno [Rita Moreno].
Speaker 1: I think she was the only one.
Speaker 2: She was really, I think, the only one, you know.
Speaker 1: And Natalie Wood.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And while we as children--even as children I knew that, it still brought with it--Puerto Ricans were never talked about, you know.  And, and we didn't see any black Puerto Ricans, you know.  Rita Moner- Moreno was the darkest Puerto Rican and, and she is considered white in, in a manner of speaking.  So there wasn't much identity there.  It was later on TV when Deborah Crable and this guy I can't remember his name, he was a dark Puerto Rican and we say, "Oh, he looks like daddy, he looks like daddy," you know.
Speaker 1: Right, I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He used to be one of The Last Poets at one time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so therefore we got that kind of identity.
Speaker 1: I'll think of this name before it's over here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But I know he's--Gylan Kain that was one of the guys with him and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he was--I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 638426
Speaker 1: How did you like school?  You, you went to Farren [John Farren Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Farren was good.  I was, let's see I was the, I don't know if I was the art editor or assistant art er- art editor and we had a little newspaper called the Farren Echo [ph.] and I would always have an article or do a picture that they featured in the Farren Echo.
Speaker 1: Now, what--when did you develop, start developing a facility for art or, or interest in art?
Speaker 2: Actually, when I look at it now, actually then I didn't know it, you know, I was very unsophisticated I didn't know I had a facility for art.  I remember my mother [Annie Clark Parker] got me crayons, I think they called 'em Crayolas then.  And while all the children would make the little faces white, you know, I would always make them brown.  And so they thought that was strange, they, you know, why is he making brown faces?  And--
Speaker 1: Now, this is something that probably white people watching this are not aware of.  But--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I hear what you're saying and I know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it's true that when black people, I guess, because of television and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --newspapers and whatever, when they draw people as little kids they draw them as white.
Speaker 2: White, all white.  And don't ask me why I drew them as black, as brown; I don't know.  You know, but that's how I, I saw people around me and so I drew them as brown.
Story_ID: 638427
Speaker 1: So you weren't aware of your consciousness of that of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was not even aware until I got to high school [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois], and then I had [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs as an art teacher and she hit us in the face with it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, describe Margaret Burroughs for us in those days, I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know how much I should tell.  I had her for art and I think I was a freshman, and--but most of the kids in there were sophomores or something and so I was talkative and all of this.  And, and she used to say--we would have art class and I, I talked about this in my book ['African Art: The Diaspora and Beyond,' Daniel Texidor Parker], and we had more than an art class because she taught us about who we were.  And she very much emphasized who we were.  And--
Speaker 1: In terms of--as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As black people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she, understand she wore her hair, hair natural then.  And I remember how the kids would laugh at her and, and something in me, I would say, that's the way her hair is, you know.  I don't know where I got this level of consciousness from, but, but I had it and I didn't necessarily like the natural, but I knew it was, something about it--profound or, you know.  And so I, I remember once when a, a school from Barrington [Illinois], they would always visit us, we would have kind of exchange visits, and when they were coming down the hall to visit our classroom she locked the door and she said, "We, we don't let those white people in here to know what we're doing."  And I used to say hm, I, I wonder why not?  You know.  But later on I understood what she was saying, later on I understood she had a message that was for us, and that we needed to know right then and even though--and even I did not understand the message then, only now, only later could I understand how far ahead she was of her time and how she tried to share that with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just as a frame of reference, how many women at school, in the neighborhood, on television, or in the newspapers had you ever seen with their hair natural?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: This is 19--what?
Speaker 2: Fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: I, I think much later Cicely Tyson and a few others but up until that point--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Abbey Lincoln.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Miriam Makeba--
Speaker 2: Miriam Makeba (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) those were the first women.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So that was profound and I heard that she did that even before, years before you even came (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: She was doing it so she's a singular kind of a person.
Speaker 2: She was authentic, authentic in who she was.
Story_ID: 638428
Speaker 1: What medium did you like the most as a--growing up, you know, in terms of art?
Speaker 2: Really the only medium I knew, and that was crayon, you know.  Later on I, you know, how they had the tempera paints, but back when I had the tempera paint you had to mix it with water and I got more of the paint on me than on the paper and, you know.  I liked it because you could mess in it, but I couldn't really do anything serious with that medium.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you get a chance to go to the South Side Community Art Center [Chicago, Illinois] at--in, in those days?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't know about the side--South Side Community Art Center.  We didn't, I didn't know about it until I was older and oddly enough then I was in an organization and we presented films there and for the kids and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there, what were your initial, I guess, impressions as, as a youth of Africa?  As we sit here in a room filled with--well, a few rooms filled with African art of all types, what was your first exposure to Africa and, and--?
Speaker 2: My first exposure was in elementary school [John Farren Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and, and I would always look at National Geographic.  And I, I--you know, I didn't view them as a part of me but I was intrigued by the Africans.  And they al- always made sure that the pictures they had were black, you know, so it was unmistakably Africa.  And one time I was looking through a National Geographic and there was this African marriage and this woman had--
Story_ID: 638429
Speaker 1: --On a European dress with like a white veil and I said, that doesn't look right, you know, to me I said that doesn't look like right, you know, she, she should have, you know, (gesture) that African stuff and so that was my exposure.  And then when you would go to the movies every now and then they would have shorts on Africa and showed it always in a negative way.  Now National Geographic would show some, sometimes the beauty of the land and all that, you know, but always in the movies it was negative.  And so it wasn't until I was a teenager and in my twenties, I remember I started teaching my kids in elementary school [Thomas Chalmers Elementary School; Thomas Chalmers School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois] about Africa because now we're in the '60s [1960s] and I had to study about it and learn about it and I thought that they should learn about it.
Speaker 2: Well, would you think that most black children growing up in those days had a negative impression of Africa?
Speaker 1: Very negative.  I remember so well we were going to the museum of natural history [Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois], they had a special program and I had been teaching my kids a unit on Africa and they made clay images and all of that and of a African village and all of this.  And I said, "Now, when you go here, go there you're going to see some people who are nude and it's very hot there and that's why they dress that way and they're proud of their bodies."  And some of the other classes, teachers, took their students there, and I, I was so proud of my kids and I told them the difference between nude and naked and all of that.  And so when they went to the museum all the kids, (makes sounds) you know, and my, my kids said, "Mr. Parker [HistoryMaker Daniel Texidor Parker], look at them, they just doing that because they don't understand," you know.  And that's when I knew you can teach kids anything.  You have to teach it and they was curious to learn.

Speaker 1: At DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois], now you were there during the period of time that--sort of made national news and that was when the DuSable Panther basketball team [DuSable Panthers]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --went to the state (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --finals and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --had the dramatic--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --basically the door kind of slammed on them at the, in the state finals--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --with Charlie Brown [HistoryMaker Charles Brown], and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and Paxton Lumpkin and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --the rest of 'em--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --these are legendary names now in a sense.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what, what was your exposure to that and what was your reaction to it at the time?
Speaker 2: Oh, at the time everyone was elated.  We, you know, we were, we--because no one had looked at us as really of importance.  And so this really wowed us, DuSable, you know, and made us feel good.  Then as you put it the door slammed, it's like, yeah, that that's what white people do, you know.  That's the way they react.  But for the moment that we were in the limelight it was a glorious thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first Chicago [Illinois] school to go downstate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was glorious.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Glorious, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you know any of the guys on the team and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  And as a matter of fact we just had our fiftieth class reunion.  Let's see when was it?  It was really a couple of months ago and the class honored me with a Golden Nugget Award [ph.].  And some of the guys were there, you know.  Hurd [ph.], he has since died but some of the others were there.  And it was--
Speaker 1: Well, Charlie Brown I think--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is still--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it was, it was good, it was good, it was good (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  I had to, I had to raise that, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 638431
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Actually I only had one or two semesters; I liked architecture, architecture that was really my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, well, at the time you graduated were you still working on a paper?  I mean, I know that, that was at Farren [John Farren Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], did you work on the DuSable school newspaper as a student [at DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And were you involved in running for class offices or any cl- were you involved in any clubs and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was in the physics club.  And I don't know now why I was in the physics club because I wasn't good in physics at all.  And they didn't call it the physics club. They had, they called it something else and I think that's why I was attracted to it and they seemed mechanical something, you know.  And it was interesting but I, I now looking back I don't know why I should be attracted to that because that wasn't one of my strong points.  Maybe it was this architecture thing that I had going that I was interested in.
Story_ID: 638432
Speaker 1: Did you consider yourself a college prospect at that time?  Did you say, "Well, I'm going to college"? Were, were your aspirations like that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I always knew I was going to college.  I didn't really know how because we were so poor, but that's when, at the time Wilson Junior College [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] was, was there and I think it was, it was free we just had to pay a registration or something, so I went to Wilson.  And I, I majored in architecture.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, was there anything memorable about your graduation that you can share with us before we take you to Wilson?
Speaker 2: I remember after--the night after we graduated we went by DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois], it was a group of us, five or six, and we said, we, I think it was already nostalgia was setting in because we didn't know what the future was bringing.  And after it was all over and there was nobody there we walked around outside.  I think we went and ate at, oh, what was this place on 53rd [Street] or 57th [Street] and, and King Drive [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive]; it was a place popular for us to go and eat.  I think it might have been a Chinese place.  But when we were really being grown up we would go there so we would go there after graduation.  And then we came back to DuSable and just walked the grounds.  And we, I remember feeling we were kind of sad.  And it was an older guy, I think it was a boyfriend of one of the girls, and he had the car and we walked the grounds and he said, he kind of laughed at us, he, "Look at them, they, they're, they're feeling sad because they're a graduate and then they can't, can't come back," or something like that.  And I just remember that.  And so I said well, I didn't say another page because I wasn't that poetic then, but something like that; I knew I had to move on.
Story_ID: 638433
Speaker 1: Before we leave DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] completely, can you tell us were there any other notable people there, teachers and students that you remember especially?
Speaker 2: Oh, Tim Black [HistoryMaker Timuel Black], he was most nor- notable, Gwen Ferguson [ph.].
Speaker 1: And Tim was a teacher, right?
Speaker 2: Tim was a teacher there.  Gwen Ferguson now, who was Gwen Roddy [ph.] at the time she was at DuSable who later became one of my coworkers and I'm sure we will get to that.  Nell Matilda Woodward [ph.] and, of course, Captain Walter E. Dyett [sic. Walter Dyett], you know.  Just when I was there these were the people who crossed my path and I crossed their path really.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now Captain Dyett he's really famous.   Were--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --were any of his famous students in there, any of the musicians or, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That went to--
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness, I can't remember his name now but I remember his sister, we had English together and their mother died, and I remembered him. It doesn't come to me right now.
Speaker 1: Well, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But just, there were like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --quite a few--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --successful students--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --like Captain Dyett that went on to--

Speaker 1: Was the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois] still open then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it was.  Very much so.  Very much so, um-hm.  I remember going to the Regal, I would take my siblings and I, we would go to the Regal and I was en- entranced with, when the guys would have pink suits and pink shoes and, (laughter) and then, then green suits and green shoes and, you know.  And we would see all the greats, all the greats.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I, I think just the style and, you know, not only was I en- en- entranced in, in the music but it's the style and the dressing and, and they all were in beat and, you know.  And I said, oh, you know, that's what they were trying to do at DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois], you know.  That's what they were trying to do with us, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have, since you were concerned about style, how would you, did you--can you describe, I guess, how you would go out, you know, to a party or to an event in those high school days?  What, what would you be dressed in?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Most of the time I wouldn't wear a tie, but I came up during the Brook Brothers era and I remember the guys who were the dressers would wear the Brooks Brothers, the tie and even a suit--or they said it was from Brooks Brothers anyway.  I didn't dress like that, you know, we just couldn't afford to but I, I did dress, we didn't wear jeans so much, we wore slacks, you know, and shirts.  When I would go out I would wear a suit coat, you know.  We were just more formal than the kids are today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I, I remember the Grand Ballroom [Chicago, Illinois].  They, they had many sets there and, and I don't know until this day why, but they were selling drinks and we must have been an older set, I don't know if we had any business being there, and I would, could go to the counter, I would have my sunglasses on and I could get a drink and then the rest of the kids said, "Well, get a drink for us, get a drink for us," and I would go and get a drink for them.  And we are still in high school so, you know, I don't know--and I always looked young so I don't know if it were the glasses or what--he kind of thought I was older.  But we had some great experiences in high school.  I was part of a singing group.  I just saw--unfortunately we went to a funeral, there was a funeral at my church and there was some of the, my high school buddies and some of them even go back to elementary school [John Farren Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and we were talking about the singing group we were in, you know.  And--
Speaker 1: What was the name of your group?
Speaker 2: The Royal Gents [ph.] I think.  And we would go to some of the parties and sing and--up, right on 47th Street, you know, at the, the little high school parties that they would have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did they still have the big talent shows at DuSable or were they--?
Speaker 2: I don't know if they had them now but I know they had them when my siblings were still there because I went.  They were just outstanding, outstanding.
Story_ID: 638435
Speaker 1: How were your grades when you graduated?
Speaker 2: I was a G student.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what?
Speaker 2: G, you know, I just--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --I made Gs, you know, the whole time, you know.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I think--
Speaker 1: --the grading system had Gs?  It was gre- ?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a G was good.  And I think my last semester because I wanted to go to college I had Es.  I think I even made the honor roll.  Yeah, I made the honor roll because I would always--at the honor assembly, all these, the, what I thought were smart kids would always get honors and I said, I should, I should do that, I--.  And I think the last year I was one of the, you know, I was proud to get Es, excellent.  And some superior in some course, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, okay, Wilson Junior College [Woodrow Wilson Junior College], so did you start immediately in the, that summer or did you start going in the fall?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, the fall, the fall, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, Wilson is now Kennedy-King [Kennedy-King College], it's in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], right?  Sort of.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  It's Kennedy-King.  And when I was going there it was still mostly all white, you know, white students were in my class, classes.  And I, I remember taking architecture and I was good, I was good.  As a matter of fact, I thought it was really something in some of our projects the white boys would, "Oh, Dan [HistoryMaker Daniel Texidor Parker], how do you do this, how do you do that?"  And I, I would say to myself, gee, I went to DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois], and they're asking me, you know.  And I felt good about that.
Story_ID: 638436
Speaker 1: What happened?  Is there, did you become distracted from architecture as a goal or?
Speaker 2: Two things happened.  One, I was very poor in math, but I would struggle along.  And two, when we, at the end of the program we had to have an internship, and all the white guys were able to get internships and I wasn't able.  I remember, I remember well going to Jesse Owens' office and asking him--that I was interested in architecture and if he could find an intern- for me.  Someone like him was, I didn't even realize how, how great it was to be accessible to someone like that, you know, I didn't even know.  And he wasn't able to find it but just going into his office.  And so I said, well, so I can't do that, so I went into teaching.
Speaker 1: Now, where, where was Jesse Owens located?  Was he with an institution or what?
Speaker 2: No, he had an office, it was, now we call it West Loop on, I think, on Wabash [Avenue].  It was in a kind of old building in the West Loop [West Loop Gate; West Loop, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it wasn't in conjunction with--it, it was just Jesse Owens basic- or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --foundation or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  But anyway my [paternal] aunt and uncle all, they said, you know, go to Jesse Owens or go to, you know, someone in the black community that we always help.  And then it was really good because even though he was in the West, West Loop, we didn't call it that then, it was someone we felt we could identify with, we, we could go to for help and was accessible.
Speaker 1: So, so he kept regular office hours (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting, I never heard that story.  Okay.  So, so what else did you study at Wilson [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] and, and how did, you know, did you get your associates degree there or, or what happened?
Speaker 2: I got the associate's degree there.  I went to Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] for a brief period of time and then I went to Chicago State [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where I got my teaching degree.  I, I received a bachelor's of arts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was, was Chicago State then Chicago Teachers College?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you--is, is being a teacher something you had really thought seriously about before?
Speaker 2: Well, my people told me, "Boy, you're not gonna make any money being an artist," you know.  And so I went to architecture and, and I couldn't get inroads into that.  And so I then became a teacher, and I didn't realize how much talent I had in that, you know.  My little siblings, we would have--play teacher with my cousin then and we would do games and even math problems and whatnot, but I didn't know that I would actually enjoy teaching, and it was elementary school teaching.
Story_ID: 638437
Speaker 1: So are, are there any stories about Chicago Te- Teachers College [Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] before we move out of that?  And about what year is this that you graduate from Chicago Teachers?
Speaker 2: Ah, four (unclear)--
Speaker 1: So you came out of high school [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] in '59 [1959], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 2: And it took me five years to get the bachelor's [degree] because of my deterrent into architecture.  I had to then change majors and none of those classes--I had to in a way start over again.
Speaker 1: So we're saying 1964 basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So when you--are there any memorable teachers from Chicago Teachers College that, that--or, or students that--?
Speaker 2: I remember them mostly when I went back for my master's [degree] than in the undergrad.  I, I wasn't that impressed.  I think I was, I was joining a fraternity and, and I, I knew I had to study to keep the grades up, and I had to study to get out and all I wanted to do was get out and I was glad when I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you get your first assignment immediately after graduating?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  At, at Chalmers, Chalmers, C-H, C-H-L-M-E-R-S [sic.], Chalmers Elementary School [Thomas Chalmers Elementary School; Thomas Chalmers School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois].  It was on Roosevelt Road and California [Avenue].  And some of us who had graduated from Teachers all went to Chalmers.  Valerie Jarrett [ph.]; Doris Kennan [ph.], now she's Doris Cammon [ph.]; Verdell [ph.]; we all were at Chicago State and went to Chalmers.
Story_ID: 638438
Speaker 1: You discovered you had a gift for teaching?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and I, I, I liked it.  In those days we made very little money and we u- would use what resources we had [at Thomas Chalmers Elementary School; Thomas Chalmers School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois].  We would go to the teachers store and spend part of our paycheck to buy equipment, books, and, and copy paper, and there was something called a, a Xerox machine, duplicating machine, and we would share in, and, in the materials.  It was an interesting time.  And I look upon and look at the teachers now wherein they have a wealth of materials for the kids, I know it's nothing like maybe what they have in the suburbs, but how we took our own money and bought so much.  It wasn't, you weren't reimbursed for this, you know, it's like out of our own dedication because we wanted these kids to learn.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and you taught mainly, did you teach like all the subjects or did you--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) O- okay.
Story_ID: 638439
Speaker 1: Now, I have a note here that, is this the period of time in '64 [1964] that you went to Mexico City [Mexico] to study Spanish?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.  One of my frat brothers, Walter Broad [ph.], we d- Walter learned Spanish and I think he learned it well, and I was learning Spanish.  And, and we said we were going to Mexico to learn it even better and I, I was to learn it, and we went to the University of Mexico [ph.].  We drove there from here and drove all the way to Mexico.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was quite, quite a sojourn we had.
Speaker 1: I'm just tempted to ask what, what kind of car did you have to--?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't even remember.  I don't even remember the car.  But it, it held up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It held up, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, was there a very large Mexican population in Chicago [Illinois] in those days the way it is, I mean, I know it doesn't approach what it is now but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was large enough, it was large enough.  I remember at the time, let's see, I had just graduated [from Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois]. I had just graduated I think when we went, and I asked this Mexican girl I knew, we had to write a letter in Spanish to introduce ourselves, you know, to the university and to tell why we wanted to go there.  And she says, "Well, I, I can't write it, Dan [HistoryMaker Daniel Texidor Parker], but I'll have this Puerto Rican girl to write it," and, and she wrote it.  And she said, "Do you know how, how it is to have a Puerto Rican to write?  That's like having a hillbilly--."  And I felt really insulted by that but she innocently, you know, because supposedly Mexicans speak better Spanish than, to Puerto Ricans.  You know, that there is this hierarchy of everything.  And so well, anyway, I was accepted in the program and it was quite an experience.
Story_ID: 638440
Speaker 1: How long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was, I was there for--it was the summer, a whole summer program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You stayed in Mexico City [Mexico]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Is this the first time you had been out of the country?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Was there any, any story from that summer that you can share with us that, that's--
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.  We met some girls from Panama and we didn't know if they were from Panama or where they were from.  And so I don't know--we passed them on the street and so, and then we saw them somewhere else and then Walter [Walter Broad (ph.)] approached them, he had more nerve than me.  And so they said, "Oh, we figured you were probably Americans because had you been Panamanian you would have said something to us. You would have made a pass at us," or something like that.  And so as a result of hooking up with them, they--when--we went to parties at a Mexican family's home and we had a really great time.  We went to the pyramids and that's when I said, now, these pyramids, they're like the pyramids of Africa and so how did, you know, this concept of the pyramids.  And then we saw the Olmec Indians with the broad noses and the big lips and I didn't say anything but I said, you know, these look more like African people than Indian people to me.  And so upon studying you found that many Africans went to Mexico long before Columbus [Christopher Columbus] did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, those faces of La Venta [Mexico], those Olmec faces.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, so did you take a lot of pictures when you were there and--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  And we even went to Veracruz [Mexico] and some of the other places that black folks did settle.  We didn't see too many of them and, of course, they didn't speak English but--and they, their Spanish was different too.  But they received us, you can tell by the way they looked at us that they were receptive, you know.
Story_ID: 638441
Speaker 1: Now when you, you got back, you--in '67 [1967] you worked on a master's degree at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] in psychology?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now what, what made you, you know, switch to psychology?
Speaker 2: Well, really it was counseling.  What made me is that teaching I saw, I say these kids need something more than teaching, they need guidance or something.  And I do know when, in those days I don't know if they do the same, when the boys--when the girls go to gym you have the boys in the classroom by themselves, and when the girls go to gym, you know, you have--when the boys go to gym you have the girls in the classroom.  And so I would take this time not to give them busy work but I would say, "Come on fellows, let's move these chairs around," and they sit in a group around me and we would talk.  I, I said, "Just, you know, tell me--," and they would talk about their families, they would talk about things like that.  And I did the same thing with the girls, the girls would talk more than the boys but they would get, begin to reveal things about their families and this is when I said oh, I could be of better service being a counselor and in psychology.  So I first wanted to be a school psychologist, and then I said--you--then all you're really doing is testing, you know, you're not treating as such.  And so I became a counselor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you stay at the same school and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, that's when I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --went to Spry Upper Grade Center.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was Spry?
Speaker 2: Spry was near Harrison High School [Carter H. Harrison Technical High School].
Speaker 1: Okay.  This was the west--
Speaker 2: On the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that was a very, very interesting because I had very good rapport with my principal at, at Chalmers [Thomas Chalmers Elementary School; Thomas Chalmers School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois], but I interviewed for the job at--the principal and the assistant principal interviewed me and they said, "You know, your principal said you're somewhat of a, a black activist but you know what?  You're just what we want."  And because their school had eighth to sixth grade, it was all white, and seventh and eighth grade the students were bused in and they were integrated and they needed someone to work with these seventh and eighth graders and they thought I could be that person.
Story_ID: 638442
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968] is when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was at Chalmers [Thomas Chalmers Elementary School; Thomas Chalmers School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois] then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's prior--okay, that's prior to getting there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: But so you weren't on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] when the riots broke out?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was right there--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --in the middle of them.
Speaker 1: All right.  For some reason I had Chalmers south, but that's on the West Side too?
Speaker 2: Roosevelt [Road] and California [Avenue] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, that's right, that's right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you did say that.  So you're right in, yeah, you're right in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So tell us a little bit about that day.
Speaker 2: Well, it was a strange day because, let's see he was, I don't know what day of the week that was, but I know it was a stillness and a quietness.  And then I didn't really know that my children felt that way about white people that they did, you know, because they, we, when we talked about their living conditions the boys seemed to understand it better than the girls, the girls said, "Well, we can play," so and so.  And the boys said, "They don't understand do they, Mr. Parker [HistoryMaker Daniel Texidor Parker]?  They don't understand," and I found that interesting.  And when King was assasser- assassinated, they said, "See, you see, you see how they are, you see--," you know, and I just let them talk, all I could do is let them talk because I was in a state of grief myself.  You know, I was in my twenties and, you know.  And so I let them talk and--
Speaker 1: And so, I think the word, if I understand, if I remember correctly, the word sort of hit in the early afternoon--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that King had been assassinated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I heard it on the radio (unclear) and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  And I told them, you know, be careful going home and whatnot, but that night it was disaster.
Speaker 1: So there was sort, sort of a lull before the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I think it--just in a state of shock, in a state of shock.  And then when some kind of reality hit, I think the community was already in a state for it and it just needed something to click it off one way or another.
Speaker 1: So how much damage was done to the com- the neighborhood that Chalmers was in?
Speaker 2: Well, to the homes there wasn't much but to the factories and other stores it was, you know.  Because Douglas Park [Chicago, Illinois] was on one side so and then the homes were on this side, it was only on the east side that you had stores.  And so Chalmers so- was somewhat isolated, you know, for most of the things but when you moved a few blocks that's when you saw the devastation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, okay.  So that that was prior to going over to the Spry school [Spry Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  By that time had, had anything been rebuilt over there or, or reestablished?
Speaker 2: Well, at least it was cleaned up, you know, it was cleaned up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were any of your colleagues hurt?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they was fine (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: They were fine.
Story_ID: 638443
Speaker 1: So you were a counselor in the public, in the public schools for, it says here for over thirty-five years. Is that true?
Speaker 2: I--yes.  What you saw, what you see there is I was a counselor at the public school [Spry Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], but quickly I went to the community college [Olive-Harvey College, Chicago, Illinois].  I was only a counselor in the public school setting for about a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So did you, I mean, were you actively trying to get out of the public school setting or did you just find--did, did an opportunity present itself?
Speaker 2: Opportunity presented itself.  I remember when I, I got my master's degree in counseling [from Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] and I told my students that I was going to leave and kids are so astute they, they're so much smarter than what we give them credit for.  I told--the class were divided into reading levels and they gave me the toughest boys because I had the best discipline, you know.  And I can--they, they learned in my class, you know.  And so I told them that I got a degree, another degree and I was leaving them and they said, "You're not going because you have to, you're going because you want to."  And that kind of stopped me because I said I, I got a degree in counseling and I have to leave, you know.  And they picked up on that have to, you know, and these were the kids that was not supposed to be the smarter ones but they picked up on it.  And, and really they made me feel bad, you know.  They really did.
Speaker 1: So you really had a bond with your students then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 638444
Speaker 1: Now, how did you, now, you're, you're a mild mannered person.  I assume that the Daniel Parker [HistoryMaker Daniel Texidor Parker] we're looking at today is a representation of the, the one of days of--in the past, you know, on some level--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --still.  You're a mild mannered fellow and, you know, measured speech. How did you manage to keep discipline?
Speaker 2: I become a different animal in the classroom, and I can switch it on and off so easily.  Only when I was at Olive-Harvey [Olive-Harvey College] one, one class they really, they got me, they said, "Mr. Parker, you try to be bad but we know you're not, you know."  But most of them I can bluff 'em, you know.  And because I am hard when it comes--well, at the college level, with the little kids, you know, you have to be tough but you, you have to give them more nurturing, nurturing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Olive-Harvey is far South Side [Chicago, Illinois], 103rd Street.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Named after two Vietnam War veterans [Milton L. Olive, III and Carmel Bernon Harvey, Jr.].
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: How did you like Olive-Harvey?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I loved Olive-Harvey.  I loved Olive-Harvey.  My introduction, one of my frat brothers was working there and he told me a job was available there and I interviewed for it.  The day I went for the interview, you know, I was sharp, had my little suit and shoes and all of that shined.  And they hadn't built all the roads there and my car got stuck in the mud, you know, I mean, stuck in the mud like sinking down in the mud.
Speaker 1: Like for those who have never seen it, Olive-Harvey is surrounded by a lot of real estate--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on the far south end of the city and--
Speaker 2: Yes, factories.  And they hadn't been built the road, roading system.  I was going to be late for the interview so I just left the car right where it was and I walked in the mud and so when I got to the dean of students' office I'm just a mess.  And so I, I told him I said, "Sir, you know how the roads are like that, so can I go to the men's room for a minute and clean myself up?"  And so that was my introduction to Olive-Harvey.  So I went and got much of the mud off, off me that I could and at the end of the interview, I said, "Now can you have some students help me get my car back on to the road?"  And he laughed and the rest is history.  Olive-Harvey became my life for thirty years.
Story_ID: 638445
Speaker 1: What were some of the challenges of counseling at Olive-Harvey [Olive-Harvey College, Chicago, Illinois]?  It's a commuter school, nobody really lives in the neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, as such--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --out there.  And about how many students are, would be at Olive-Harvey?
Speaker 2: Well, they had about five, six thousand students.  That, if you recall in 1970 was the era that the vets were coming home so you had compounded problems.  That was the era of the '60s [1960s], so you had the Vietnam [Vietnam War] vet, you had the '60s [1960s], and you had some students who had just moved to a new facility because they were in--let's see the high school all the way east of there--
Speaker 1: Is that Robeson [Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois] or--?
Speaker 2: No, no.  That's west.  East, all the way east.  It'll come to me.  And so they combined two schools and--two colleges and so you had some conflict between the blacks and the whites and all of this was upon Olive-Harvey.  The black/white issue was short lived because all, they built Daley [Richard J. Daley College, Chicago, Illinois] and all the white kids went to Daley for the most part.  And so we were left with--there were these militant black kids, some were, you know, this is the black power time.  And, and the average age, age group was twenty-six so it was rather high because you had the Vietnam veterans, so I was the same age as the students, you know.  And so I could relate to all that they were saying.  And they housed, they gave to me--a bloc of my students were those who had been incarcerated so I had all of that, I'm twenty-five, twenty-six.  And it was an interesting time, it was an interesting time.  I remember [HistoryMaker] Herb Kent came up on campus, canvas, and--campus and he did a radio show.  Muhammad Ali came on campus.  Ture Kame--Kwame [Kwame Ture], came on campus, you know, to talk to the students.  We had many people who--notable people, who came to talk to the students.  And for the most part the students got these people on campus because they were activists, they, you know, they were very much involved in, in the school, in the running of the school.
Story_ID: 638446
Speaker 1: You mentioned the Vietnam [Vietnam War] veterans.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have many cases of posttraumatic stress syndrome problems in, at Olive-Harvey [Olive-Harvey College, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One in particular comes to mind.  I, I would have--the door was here and my desk was the opposite end of the room, kind of in the corner, and so I didn't know posttraumatic stress syndrome, I didn't know what that was or that existed.  And I know this veteran, I would see him periodically, periodically.  He had a true, a true--a few problems but he more or less was okay.  And then one day something had ticked him off, I don't know what, and he came to my office and he slammed the door which, which was first rude, you know, and he said, "Mr. Parker [HistoryMaker Daniel Texidor Parker], I have been taught to kill, and you--do you know that I could kill you before you could get out of this office?"  And I said, "You know, if you've been taught to kill, sure, you, you can do that.  And that wouldn't mean anything because you're powerful against someone powerless," and so we began to talk through his anger.  So after he left, I said, you know, I'm moving my desk from (laughter) up against the wall.  But just situations like that it was a growing experience for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And some of my classmates from DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] had gone to the [U.S. military] service and, you know, I had gone to school and they ended up being my counselee, and so it was very, very interesting for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did, did you find on the most part that they were more mature or--than younger students would be?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, this was the age of, in '73 [1973] you start at Olive-Harvey and this is the, sort of the Black Arts Movement days.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And did, were you like an active participate in the Black Arts Movement as such?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't.  I knew some of them, I knew when they built a Wall of Respect [Chicago, Illinois]--
Story_ID: 638447
Speaker 1: --On Langley [Avenue] and we'd, we would go there on the weekends.  But I didn't become as involved in it and I became more involved after--more involved in art, in the art scene after that movement and my regrets is that I wasn't as involved in it.  I'm, I was involved in some of the movement with some of the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] meetings and I didn't even know I was going to a Black Panther meeting.  You just went, they'd say, "Come here tonight," and, you know, they're having singing and these groups and, you, you know, it was, it was an exciting time, exciting time.
Speaker 2: Did, did you have favorite cultural hangouts in those days?  'Cause I know there's several--and the Afro-Arts Theater [Chicago, Illinois] was a big deal with Phil Cohran [HistoryMaker Philip Cohran] and (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Phil Cohran, he was a favorite.  Went to plays at Kuumba Workshop [Kuumba Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] with [HistoryMaker] Val Gray Ward, right down here where the El Rukns presided before the El Rukns were the Black Panthers [sic.] and--
Speaker 2: At the Oakland Wall theater [sic. Oakland Square Theater, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, Oakland Wall.  And they, that was like weekly, you know, something.
Story_ID: 638448
Speaker 1: So yeah, I was very involved in the movement. Even Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and I marched with him.  So--
Speaker 2: Oh, so did you, you made the march to Cicero [Illinois] or did you--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I certainly did.  Now, I did that through my church.  And oddly enough we had a white pastor, Reverend Lashay [ph.], and we went to Cicero, we--and marched.  I marched again on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] with Dr. King.  So--
Speaker 2: What was the name of your church, I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: St. Mark United Methodist Church (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) St. Mark, okay.  Now, this is the same St. Mark that's in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] now?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm, 85th [Street] and St. Lawrence [Avenue].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I think it's, is Brown [P. Devon Brown] still the pastor there?  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He, he's long gone.  He preached Thanksgiving for the Thanksgiving service.  A young minister, Jon McCoy--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --is the minister now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know when I left town I think the, the--Lee P. Brown's son was--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: He's the last one I remember being pastor.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  And then we had a series of people and we had Myron McCoy.  And after Myron McCoy we had Jon McCoy.  So, no relationship but--
Speaker 2: So church was still a big, was a big part of life, I guess, in those days, would you say?
Speaker 1: Yes, not as big, but when it involved itself in the movement, I became more involved in the church as it related to the movement.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 638449
Speaker 1: Oh when did Armstead Allen or, or I don't even know if he was the initiator of the Black Studies Conference but, but when did, was, when did that start when you were there?
Speaker 2: Okay.  It started around '73 [1973], '74 [1974], you know.  We would have--the United Black Staff at Olive-Harvey [Olive-Harvey College, Chicago, Illinois] would get together and meet and we would meet with the students, you know.  And we would have a little conference at the school and workshops at the school on, on the weekend.  And Armstead began then to have conferences.  And so in the mid-seven- by the mid-'70s [1970s] we had established that Black Studies Conference.  I remember one distinctly, had Karenga come and I said my god, who is this man, you know.  He was so profound.
Speaker 1: That's [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The Dr. Maulana Karenga.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That probably was, I'm thinking it probably was 1976 or '7 [1977]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when he, when he first reemerged (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, in the mid-'70s [1970s], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so were you a part of that conference in terms of planning or, or?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't because I wasn't and, it's odd, I provided a course they wanted to teach, black psychology.  And so because of psychology being my background, I helped them really form that course.  But I was in counseling, so I was in another department.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638450
Speaker 1: Did you join the Association of Black Psychologists in those days or?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I did.  I didn't keep the membership up but I went to the conferences and whatnot that they had.
Speaker 1: Do you have any reflections on Dr. Bobby E. Wright?
Speaker 2: Bobby Wright was a very determined, brilliant, brilliant, and very activist young man.  I even got to know him personally.  And what he preached in private was what he preached in public, you know.  And he made a profound, profound difference in the lives of black people over there on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and, and other places.  I just remember when he died they had his, not too far over here was the funeral at the, this church and he had the drums beating, had the drums beating, and I said yes, that's Bobby, yeah, that's him, that's him.  He wanted to be taken out of here with the drums.
Speaker 1: And that, that's in 1981, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Or '2 [1982], '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982], right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 638451
Speaker 1: When did you really start collecting art?  Now, what--when did you really start doing that consciously?
Speaker 2: Let's see, maybe you can say in the seventy--1970.  I started getting prints, you know, not anything of, of substance but--to me it was of substance, it was prints and figurative pieces.  And I remember around '72 [1972] I moved north, and I would go in these shops and there I would see these--African art.  And so that's when I start, started the collection of African art.  I remember old--a classmate had a furniture store on 87th Street and in it he sold African art.  And I remember one of the first pieces of African art I got from him, that I still have.  One of the first pieces I got in a, on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois]. It's a simple bust, female bust, Nigerian, and it, they sell it as, they call it airport art, and it's just art that they produce en masse from, for the consumer who are more or less not the collector, but the consumer who says, "I want a piece of African art."  And I started and like any good addiction it overcomes you.  And so it--African art really became my first love.  And maybe that's why I didn't--with [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson and all the Wall of Respect [Chicago, Illinois], I like the art but I didn't, I was more into the African art and later I came into the works on--with paper, pencil, and oils.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you would--when did you kind of start producing art again, about the same time or?
Speaker 2: Well, right, I'm not an artist as such; I'm just a collector.  So I remember I took an art class when I was at Chicago State [Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] and I did things with chalk and I loved the chalk because you could just mix it and fade in and fade out and blend and do all kinds of things.  And they were okay, you know.  My sister [Harriet Parker] framed them and have them in her house now.  So it's something that she, she likes a lot.
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of a study or consultation or guidance did you get when you began to collect?  'Cause as you said before there's certain--there's airport art--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and there's art that, you know, is pushed to tourists, and I've heard--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I don't know if you know a Dr. Okodia [ph.] from Nigeria--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --he's, he's very, I don't--you know, from what he says and, you know, most people don't know the difference and he--.  You know, so what, how did you get, you know, trained to really identify what's really valuable or wasn't?  Or does that--is that even important?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, it is important.  And I then began to train myself.  I, you know, from my students going back to elementary school and, and--teaching elementary school [at Thomas Chalmers Elementary School; Thomas Chalmers School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois] going back to them making clay figures and the African village to going on the North Side and seeing these arts in, in, in resale shops.  I then began to--and then over here Windows to Africa [Chicago, Illinois], a guy named Patrick [Patrick Woodtor] and a guy named Dio [Dio Lee (ph.)], they began to educate me.  And I began to look at the art and not just the ones that attracted me but really look at the art and began to see what tribes they came from and family groups they came from.
Story_ID: 638452
Speaker 1: Is it more important to, to find something that's aesthetically pleasing or is it something to--is it more important to know the origin and the use of the piece or?
Speaker 2: Well, well, if something is going to be in your home and you're going to like looking at it, it has to be aesthetically pleasing.  And next thing, you should, it's almost naturally to, what is this thing I have in my house?  What is this piece of positive art, you know?  And therefore because let's face it, as human beings we like to look at it, you know.  It--but you have to know what you're looking at, so it's part and parcel of the same thing.  But I think first you have to be attracted to look at it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in my own experience I've had people like look at African art in my home and say, "Ooh, this is evil," or, "This is voodoo," or something, you know, there's a, there's a--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --aspect of that, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That black people, I guess, still suffer from a lack of knowledge about Africa these--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --things arise so.
Speaker 2: Well, what I teach my students, pieces of art was made for a certain, certain purpose.  All African art was made for a purpose.  It wasn't just made to be looked at as European art, as something beautiful; it was made for a purpose.  When the art is taken from that environment and is no longer looked at and it's--no longer represents what it was made for, the power of that is dissipated, you know.  So it might have been voodoo and because unless you practice voodoo and the kind of voodoo in your home, art has no significance; it's a piece of wood or metal or rock or whatever it is.
Speaker 1: I think there was even, forgive me, but there was a, even a 'Twilight Zone' ['The Twilight Zone'] episode I think from the '70s [1970s] where a blonde white woman was chased through the house by a piece of African art and it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --determined to do her in.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, do, do you remember that?
Speaker 2: They, they maintain that, that kind of ignorant knowledge.  And what's so funny is the major people who collect the art are white.  And in studying African art you have to go to the white museums.  So they promote that theory for those who are ignorant as they grab the art and take it into their museums and homes and whatnot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in Chicago [Illinois] are the major collectors white people basically, of African art?
Speaker 2: In all likely- likelihood, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Have you had much--
Speaker 2: Because the African dealers that come to me, they come to me and, they said, "Well, we're so happy, you know, that you're here because most of art goes to white collectors, not black."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you familiar with some of the white collectors when you, and, and did you have a discourse with them when you started or, or was it mostly with the African--
Speaker 2: With the Africans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With the Africans, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is a hidden kind of a world that most black people probably don't know that there are African art dealers around that are, that have, you know, authentic works that you're--you know, and the, the whole, you know, range of choices around that sort of thing.  What--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 638453
Speaker 1: How did you find, find African dealers in the first place?
Speaker 2: It's, it's amazing.  First I knew Patrick from Windows to Africa [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: That's Patrick Woodtor.
Speaker 2: Woodtor.  And Dio, Dio Young Lee [Dio Lee (ph.)] who used to wait, work in Windows to Africa.  I knew them.  And I, I had gone to Africa and some of those people in Africa come here.  And so from Patrick and from Dio, I met other Africans and they just poured into my life, you know.  And was willing to teach and I was willing to learn.  And that's really how it began.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, you then, you're in that--would you consider yourself an expert at this point?
Speaker 2: Oh, I still consider myself a student of African art.  The minute one deludes themselves into thinking they're an expert here comes a whole, whole entourage of knowledge and that you didn't believe exists.  The minute you think you have collected all the African art there is to collect, you see a piece that you've never seen before, no one can tell you where it come from, you know.  It is finite but it's limited--limitedless in terms of knowledge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638454
Speaker 1: What are some of the, I guess, themes in African art that that are--that pre- predominate, I guess?  I mean, you know, what, what milieu do, does most of the art come out of?
Speaker 2: Well, oddly enough the maternal; you see many themes of the mother and child.  It's--now sometimes it's, it's to identify the difference between or, or, or let's see, how do I say it?  A piece that represents just mother and child, an, an ancestor piece because ancestor pieces you are really calling upon the ancestors.  And so in mother and child carvings, you--the child will tell you whether or not it's an, it's an ancestor piece or if it's a piece that simply is relating and, and, and respecting the mother and child.  And if it's an ancestor piece then you see that the child is really not a child, but it's an, it's an adult.  And so it's these kind of things that helps you identify what the art is and what it's made for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I've read that sometimes size of figures represents their power rather than their actual age or development?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, certainly, certainly.  Or the size of a head. On most African art, the head is disproportionately larger than the rest of the body, and erroneously Europeans thought it was the skill of the artist, but it, it wasn't.  It was the head just represents so much the seat of knowledge, the seat of the whole human being, and so for the Africans they draw it to--sculpture it so that it, we visually see this recognition.
Speaker 1: So this person's ideas are big and--or powers, or mental powers are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or power --
Speaker 1: --large.
Speaker 2: Yes, are in the head.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The head of--is the seat of the human being.
Story_ID: 638455
Speaker 1: How are most of these ceremonial pieces and, and useful pieces acquired?  I mean, how do they end up here if they're in use and or they're designed for use?  Do you have an idea?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Several ways.  Sometimes after a piece is used in a ceremony it is discarded.  It has played it, it's role in the ceremony and it's discarded.  Sometimes it is stolen.  Sometimes they bury pieces underground so when they have raids by a tribe or someone else they are kept.  And sometimes those people know where the burial ground is for these pieces and unearth them and bring them to America.  And oftentimes they are just sold, you know.  So they're stolen, they're sold, they're discarded.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a particular art of a, of a particular group that you like the, the most or a particular style you like the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I mentioned to you the Yoruba, and the Yoruba style for whatever reason attracts me.  And I didn't know why it, it attracts me.  And I later, later learned that the Yoruba, many of them came to Puerto Rico, and that's my father's [William Parker] home.  And that's--when I wrote the book ['African Art: The Diaspora and Beyond,' Daniel Texidor Parker], I went to Puerto Rico just to do research and learn about the worshiping of that particular religion.  And Loiza [Puerto Rico] is the place where you find many black Puerto Ricans.  And I went to Loiza and I went into libraries and with my poor English--poor Spanish and their poor English, we poured through books and I got a little knowledge but I didn't get any knowledge that would tie my father to the religion but it was intriguing and I suspect with more knowledge I'll find some answers.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) More research.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638456
Speaker 1: I know there was debates in the 1960s and '70s [1970s] over whether there's such thing as a black aesthetic.  Now do you--what, what would you say an African aesthetic is?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think there is very definitely an African aesthetic as there is a Chinese aesthetic, as the so called--American Indians [Native American] aesthetic, or any kind.  The aesthetic grows out of the culture of the people.  And so as I said once before when the Africans carve something it's not just to be pretty, but it's part of their life.  And so a purist from European perspectives say, well, ah ha, you see it's not really an aesthetic, they make it utilitarian.  Well, don't you understand there is not a word for art in the African language; art is their life.  Art is part and parcel of how they live.
Story_ID: 638457
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sir, approximately, how many pieces do you have in your collection?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm often asked that.  About five hundred.  Where the gentleman is sitting there is a trunk full of artwork behind the door there.  And upstairs I have--well, back there paintings and upstairs I have statues and masks and whatnot.  I, I chose after the fire not to hang them all back up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm a ask you about the fire a little later.   And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, of all--in, in your collection, what is, what do you consider the most valuable piece?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.  Probably one of the most recent pieces I got is the piece from Cameroon.  And it may not necessarily be valued monetarily, but it is a statue of an African woman and it's sort of symbolic of her nurturing, her soul, her spirit.  And to me that's very valuable.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very valuable.
Speaker 1: And I have just one other, I mean, a question about the collection, what is the oldest piece that you have?
Speaker 2: Well, of African art it's a piece, it looks like a phallic symbol, but they put it in the ground, it's a thousand--at least a thousand years old and they put valuables in it and they cover it over, put it in the ground, and it was preserved all of that time, all of this time.  And so that's the oldest.  They put it at about a thousand years old.
Speaker 1: And it's, this is--was found where?
Speaker 2: It's all--it's found in Nigeria.  Now, they also have the same type of pieces outside the women's huts for fertility and a big, large almost penis sized--looking objects and they put them outside of their home for fertility.  But this one is a much smaller piece (gesture) like this, and it's hollow on the inside and they put it upside down, that's how they bury it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is a Yoruba piece or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No, it's, it's just Nigerian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you're not sure what group--
Speaker 2: What group it's from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638458
Speaker 1: Tell us about Mark Livingston. He was a close friend of yours.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Mark was very, very dear.  As a matter of fact he was an artist, part of his--I should say his artwork is upstairs in, in, in, one of the rooms.  He too, he collected some of the art that's part of this collection.  But he was really on his way toward being a very prominent artist.  I've known him since about, he, I think, he was seventeen when I met him.  And he was just trying to decide what he would do.  And then I hadn't seen him for a while and then I saw him and he got his master's in art therapy.  Now, most people don't even know what art therapy is, he got it from the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  He worked for the, the state.  And he worked showing--you have individuals come in who have behavioral problems of various types, and you tell them to draw and then tell you what they see in the drawing.  And that in itself is a kind of therapy.  And you can see pictures because through art people reveal themselves.  And younger people are more freer to reveal themselves than younger, than are the older people.  And so that's what he did for the living, for a living.  It was after he retired that he became more involved in art.  And I said, "Mark, I see you have a talent, you really have to develop this talent."  And he was shown, he showed at Helen's Gallery [ph.], Nilla Gallery [ph.] when she had it, he showed there, and he showed at Framing Mode [Framing Mode and Gallery, Chicago, Illinois], which, which is a framing shop.  And he did mediums in collages.  He would, would not cut images from the magazines; he would paint the images and cut them out so that he would have authentic art.  Early on, of course, he used images from magazines but then he painted his own images.  He did images in crayons.  As a matter of fact when--at the point he died he had four images--three images at Gallery Guichard [Chicago, Illinois].  And one of the images sold is, it's like, you know, the artist dies and then they want the images.  And the other two images I asked if they would, could be returned because I just wanted to keep them as a memory of him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638459
Speaker 1: There's a, a group of artists that you've cultivated--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --around the study of African art and the, the cur- I guess the cur- the curation of African art, I guess.  What do you call it?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, there are two groups.  When I was writing my book ['African Art: The Diaspora and Beyond,' Daniel Texidor Parker], I wanted a means of launching the book, and there was a group of artists who I collected and we got together, I said, "Now, I hope you guys will help me launch this book."  And they got together and I had the book launching.  What we had was along with launching the book, they had an exhibition of their work for sale.  And it was a, a wonderful affair. It happened for three days and we had hundreds of people.  And so that, that group which, no long- no longer exists as a group but individually they're still selling their art.
Speaker 1: So they were all artists?
Speaker 2: Yes.  All artists in my collection.  Part of what I wanted to do with them and after I had the book launching I presented them all with, with a piece of African art.  And I said, "Now, I want to see African art in your art work and it doesn't have to be an image of Af- African art per se but I just want to encourage you to continue in the spirit of African art because it's the source from which your energy is derived.  It's the source of which your history is derived.  And so while you don't have to have the image of African art you can have the spirit and the feel of African art reflected in your work."
Speaker 1: Is this a natural process you think for African American artists?
Speaker 2: Yeah, whether they want to or not, whether they want to or not, it's there, it's there.
Speaker 1: Now, there are some who really, vehemently deny that they have any connection to anything African or--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: --that there's a black aesthetic at all.
Speaker 2: And the more they deny it, the more it appears, the more it appears.  You know, I'm not saying for a hundred percent, but I am saying for a large majority.  And even if they do abstract, you can still see elements: boldness of line, boldness of color.  Even abstract symbolism found in many African cultures are in the abstract.
Story_ID: 638460
Speaker 1: Now, the name of your book is 'African Art: The Diaspora and Beyond' [Daniel Texidor Parker].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?  And this was published in--?
Speaker 2: Two thousand and--let's see the book is now going into its fifth year so it was published two thousand and fi- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Four [2004]?
Speaker 2: --four [2004].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And--or it could be 2005 if it's going in, in its fifth year in 2010, so I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So we're, we're in the ballpark.  But so, so you consider the diaspora of African people the Caribbean, Africa itself, and--
Speaker 2: And the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I consider there--the diaspora anywhere people from African origin--and this is Dr. Karenga's [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga] definition too--lay their heads and, and do their work; that's the diaspora.  Now, there is heavier concentrations in the Caribbean, in the United States, in Brazil, but it's also in England, that's the diaspora of, for black people.  In Sweden.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there, how do you think things, relationships are now between Africans from the continent and African Americans?  There's--you--there are more Africans from the continent of Africa here than ever before, huge communities in Chicago [Illinois] on the North Side of Nigerians, Ghanaians, a couple hundred thousand Ghanaians in this area I've heard, there's a Ghanaian Fest [GhanaFest] every year, you know, and you, you still hear some of our people say, you know, we haven't, Africans don't like us, or they're not, you know, and you--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --sometimes if you're African say that they, they're trying to avoid African Americans--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, for one reason or another.  What, what do you think about that, that relationship today?
Speaker 2: I, I think today more recently with President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] being president, he has kind of fused some of that together.  But with black people in general we still are going to cling to our own misconceptions and there are coalitions among Africans and African Americans that you don't hear about that are going on throughout this city, you know.  Because those of us who realize that we are all one people just geographically separated that it's the same with Puerto Ricans, they just geographically was born on an island but genetically we're all the same people.  And Africans have the misconception that because they're intermixed with African blood and--or, or European blood I should say, that they, that somehow makes them not as African American or as African and it may make them less African but genetically they still are.  And when we understand this and can accept that, the feeling comes together.  I find that Africans buy into the misconceptions too of African Americans, that all we do is kill each other.  They have the image of whites again as the role model for them, and with Obama being president I hope some of that image, and as they meet African Americans that they will find African Americans have developed, have developed this country more than any group of people.
Story_ID: 638461
Speaker 1: I mentioned off camera that I knew Principal Joan Crisler [Joan Dameron Crisler] of Dixon School [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --whose school is covered with African and African American art.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And she's part of one of your groups, right?
Speaker 2: She's part of the other group that I talked about [Diasporal Rhythms], I said there were two.  [HistoryMaker] Patric McCoy and I--who is another outstanding African American collector, and he and I together said, you know, all of this African art and African American art that we have, other people should know about it.  Let's form a group.  And so we did and Joan Crisler was one of the people, and Carol Briggs who at the time was president of--principal at DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois], the four of us got together and joined this group of collectors of works by African artists.  And we wanted to promote living artists.  All too often when people collected African American artists they wanted the John Biggers [John T. Biggers] or a name that--Charles White [Charles Wilbert White], but what about Jim Jones?  What about, give a real name, Adele Washington [ph.]?  Someone--what about Andre Guichard?  What about these people who walk among us, who will be, who will be the Charles Whites of the future?  And so in our organization we try and revere and recognize these current emerging--I'd like to call them emerging master artists because someday they will be the master artist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638462
Speaker 1: Tell me about the fire.  Now, you had--recently had a devastating fire here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In the very place that we're in.
Speaker 2: The very place we're sitting in now [in Kenwood, Chicago, Illinois].  July 1, 2008, I experienced a fire upstairs in a closet.  It was apparently an electrical fire.  The fire chief said to me, he said, "You know, if you had not been home everything would have burned," because believe me this was an aggressive fire.  And he said, "Had you been asleep you may not be here to talk about it."  So I was very, very fortunate.  I was right over there, writing, doing some work, and I needed a resource and I forgot I didn't have the resource down here so I went upstairs, I smelled smoke and I thought initially it was outside in the hall and I opened the door to the hall, it wasn't out there, and then I walked further down the hall because I was going into my library, which is across from where this smoke was coming, and there I opened the door and bellowing with smoke.  I tried to get some of the, now, what's rags out at, and, and move them away from the area that the smoke was coming from and I went back and the entire closet was engulfed in flames, and I knew then there was nothing I could do but leave the house, alert all the people in the building that, you know, it was a fire.  And fortunately everyone was home and everyone heard me.  And that was the beginning of a, a very horrible time in my life.
Speaker 1: So how many or, or what was the damage?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time, I experienced the fire, there, there was about a million dollars' worth of damage.  There, there--they had on another channel, on a channel they did a story on me and on the fire.  It's, it was during the time when I had moved out of this space into a rented space on 54th Street over in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  And they came back here and took pictures and it was still under construction.  I don't even know if they had started construction on the place.  And this channel had done a story on me before and so they were able to contrast some of the, the devastation of the fire along with how the place used to look.  And so it was quite dramatic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you covered with insurance on this--or did--well, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, that was one of the things that the article dealt with, in that I wasn't covered, you know.  It's like faith, faith, you know, I was going to call them and had, had made an appointment with them to talk about increasing coverage and lo and behold I had the fire.  I had the fire.
Speaker 1: So were you able to replace or restore anything that was (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Some of it was just totally destroyed, totally.  But some of it I was able to restore.  Some of it is yet to be restored.  So all in all I considered myself blessed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I'm able to be here and tell you about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the place looks fine now and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I don't know how much was here before but it's brimming with art and so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 638463
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point in life, is there any major thing that you would do differently now?
Speaker 2: Oh, there is nothing I would do differently.  I considered that I have had a blessed life.  And when you start tampering with the blessings, you, you know, tamper with something that God has presented to you.  And in spite of all the heavy trials that I may have had, considering the blessings, I, I just say thank you.  So in terms of changing something I don't know if I would.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when, when you look back again on your life what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Twofold.  My legacy first of all, part of my counseling and teaching.  I think that I have left behind some students who can remember me as someone who cared, someone who tried, and someone who did, did in that I helped them struggle and try.  Every time I go to the store and say, "Are you, Mr. Parker [HistoryMaker Daniel Texidor Parker]?  You were my counselor," or, "you were my teacher, you know what?  I just wanna thank you."  That's the legacy right there, right there is the legacy.  And secondly, I think in producing the book ['African Art: The Diaspora and Beyond,' Daniel Texidor Parker], it gives a record of our people, our culture, the richness of it, and my attempt to put it on paper, what small part I have and I paid to the culture by preserving it.
Speaker 1: Now, did your (clears throat) parents get a chance to see you grow this collection and what did they think of it?
Speaker 2: My father [William Parker] didn't, but my mom [Annie Clark Parker] did, and she, she was just overwhelmed.  This is when I--it wasn't a fraction of what I had now I had then, and she marveled at it and she was overwhelmed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, who today would you consider to be your family?  You, you don't have any children, right?
Speaker 2: I don't have any children.  But my family is my nieces--well, well, first of all let me say my brothers and sister [Harriet Parker] and those of them who had children, my nephews and nieces.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 638464
Speaker 1: Is there anything I have not asked about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think you covered it except that I think I can see the richness of my life.  I owe to my ancestors and to God, and that you asked me who I was most like, my mother [Annie Clark Parker], my father [William Parker], and I can truly say a combination of both of them added to who I am.  And, and that I have touched people and touched lives.  That, that is beyond anything that I thought I could do by myself.  And so I know there's a, a guiding force behind me that helps me do that which I do.
Speaker 1: All right.  And the last question is similar to legacy and dovetails to what you just, just said actually, and that question is, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
