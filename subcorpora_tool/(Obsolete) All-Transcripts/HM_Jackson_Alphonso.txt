Speaker 1: I'd like to also ask five People magazine-ish questions.  They're just short answers.  You know, what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: That's a good one (laughter).  I like food so much, it's--I mean, I don't eat a lot, but I love food.  I would probably say fried chicken.

Speaker 1: Okay.  This--so you like our city.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's looking prettier and prettier.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--
Story_ID: 604636
Speaker 1: We're gonna start out and I wanna start by asking you about your, your mother.
Speaker 2: My mother was probably one of the most phenomenal human beings I've ever met in my life.  I'm the last of twelve kids.  My mother was a nurse, midwife.  She had an education, an eleventh grade education and she was just a really phenomenal person and she always had great words of wisdom for all of us.  And I always say that when you're the last of twelve, you get all the wisdom that the other eleven miss.  And she was just a phenomenal human being.  And I think in many ways, I'm probably a mama's boy in the sense that I, I spent a lot of time.  Probably the most difficult thing for me today at my age is I still miss my mother a lot.  And my mother died in 1989, but she's always been with me.  And I made a very difficult decision very early on in my life when I had a debate with my brothers and sisters about whether my mother should go into a home or not, and I said she wasn't going into a home.  And it was a very difficult period in my life because I had one daughter [Annette Jackson Watkins] in college, one [Lesley Jackson] in, in prep school here [Washington, D.C.], and I had to make sure that my mother was taken care of.  And my sister [Annie Ruth Jackson] that died just a couple of years ago and I made sure she was taken care of.  And it was--it was financially very difficult.  But I think I've done well financially because I took care of my mother.  I still believe that's the reason that financially I did very well in the '90s [1990s].  So, I--I'm just--my mother was, was, was and still is my soul and I consider the same thing almost for my father [Arthur Jackson].
Speaker 1: Secretary Jackson [HistoryMaker Alphonso Jackson], what would--what is her name and, and what would you--you know, how would you describe her?
Speaker 2: Her name was Henrietta.  Her maiden name was Green [Henrietta Green Jackson].  And I would describe her as about, about a 5'1" dynamo and genius, that's how I would describe my mother.  You know, I have--I have four degrees and if I can ever be as smart as my mom and dad, I'd relish that, that possibility.  They had no degrees, but what they did with their twelve kids is just outstanding.  They educated all twelve of us.  And so, my mother, education was like the, the epiphany for her.  I mean, it was just very, very important because she told us that the only way to fight racism is to be well educated, and she made sure that her kids were educated.  And that's why I say that she's like a dynamo.  She was--she was very tough, but very compassionate at the same time.  And that might sound like an oxymoron.  How can you be tough and compassionate, but she was.  We were very, very disciplined kids and I think I'm sitting here secretary [of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] today because of her and my dad.
Story_ID: 604637
Speaker 1: Do you know much about her background or her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  It's very difficult.  My mother [Henrietta Green Jackson] in many ways was the stepchild to, to her stepmother and she had three stepsisters.  She was not treated very well.  And--but in the end, she was the one who took care of her stepmother.  None of the natural daughters took care of her.  And, again, I think that goes to the compassion of my mother.  She, she nursed her stepmother until the day she died.  And I've, I've--she told us the story many times.  And I met my--I met her stepsisters, too, and they became very, very compassionate toward my mother during her lifetime because they realized what she had gone through as a child.
Speaker 1: Now, where was she raised?
Speaker 2: In Marshall, Texas.
Speaker 1: And Marshall is how far from Dallas [Texas]?
Speaker 2: About 130 miles.
Story_ID: 604638
Speaker 1: Your father.  What do you know about his, his--give his name and what you know.
Speaker 2: Arthur Todd Jackson [Arthur Jackson].  He was from, from Marshall, Texas, too but his father and mother were actually from Georgia, and they moved to Texas early on in his life.  He was one of nine boys, all boys.  And he had a fifth grade education.  He was the oldest and he had--when his father died, he had to actually drop out of school and work to take care of his mother and his siblings, and he did that all of his life.  My father was really a very unique human being in the sense that he was an entrepreneur.  He worked in the foundry at day and at night, he cleaned buildings, and on the weekends, we cut yards.  And he had a very unique philosophy.  He made me work with him on the weekends to cut yards but not through the week because he wanted me to study.  And he made me work on the weekends because he said that he wanted me to understand manual labor so I would never have to do it.  And, and he instructed me that the most important thing was to get an education, and that's, that's the way he was.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about any, any other things about growing up?  And where was--where did he grow up?
Speaker 2: He grew up in, in Marshall--
Speaker 1: Marshall.
Speaker 2: --also.  My father was a very private man, but well dressed.  That's--I think today I dress very much like my father.  I mean, even, even if you look at the shirts that I wear, my father wore these shirts back in the 1930s, '40s [1940s], and '50s [1950s], only they had the round collar rather than the straight collar.  And he was just a very sharp dresser.  But he talked about how he had to really go out and work very early on.  My father was in World War I [WWI] and he talked about how he, he had to really take care of the family.  And I had a chance to meet a number of his brothers who said that he made the ultimate sacrifice.  All the brothers graduated from high school.  Three of them went to college and they all give great accolades to my father because he made that possible for them, and he made the ultimate sacrifice.  But he was not an unhappy man.  My father was--my father was just a really unique human being in the sense.  He never complained.  And I think the greatest thing about my mom [Henrietta Green Jackson] and dad that I can tell you and I wish I could say that for me is I never heard them say anything negative about anybody, and that's I think why I have such a positive attitude about life.  Now, I can't say that about me, but I can say that about my mom and dad.
Story_ID: 604639
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you about your siblings.  You said you were the youngest of twelve.  Can you give their names in birth order?  That's a task.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Maybe not.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: No.  I have it all written down for you.
Speaker 1: Right.  No, you have it written down for--but there are a lot.  And A seemed to be a popular start, you know, with the names.  Now, tell me what your earliest memory is of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory--well, no, I don't wanna say it like that.  It's a very negative memory.  I must've been about seven or younger and we were living in a duplex at that time.  And I cannot give you the name of the person now because it's really skipped my mind, but it will come to me, but he had just come back from the Korean War and he decided to take me to the store with him.  And he owned the duplex that we lived in because we were renting at that time.  And we walked down Dallas [Texas] on a street called Macon Street to go to the store.  And we had a policeman who was of Irish descent called Big Red [ph.] and he was very abusive to us in our community.  And that afternoon as we walked, he was being very abusive to a black woman who I think basically in my memory might have been a prostitute.  I'm not sure.  But as we walked, I wish I could remember his name now, it's just skipped my mind.  He had just come back from the Korean War and he told Big Red to take his hand off this woman.  And Big Red at that point in time threw him to the ground and shot him directly in his head.  And I ran home and told my mother [Henrietta Green Jackson] that he had killed Ray Butler, and we all came, and nothing was ever done to the policeman.  Now, that's recorded in history in Dallas.  There's a book that was written that I will get you the name of that that was recorded.  That's a memory that sears in my mind all the time.  I've never forgotten that.  To see somebody's brains blown out, it was just unbelievable at my age.  And only because he wanted to basically protect the lady, and that sears in my memory.
Story_ID: 604640
Speaker 1: The second thing I think that sears in my memory is, it was a school in Dallas [Texas] called St. Mark's [St. Mark's School of Texas] and I was a sprinter, and that day they had the junior Olympics, and it was my junior year in college--in high school [St. Peter Academy, Dallas, Texas].  And I won the hundred to two hundred and the long jump.  But what's so memorable is the day that I set the junior Olympic record.  Bob Hayes set, set the world's record in the hundred yard dash that very same day, and then later on, I became very close friends with Bob Hayes.  So, these are unique situations in my life.  The third one I would say is, is when Bernard Lee, most people don't know who he is, who was the closest person in the world to Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  If you read any book, whenever you read any book about Dr. King, you will always see the name Bernard Lee.  And Bernard Lee came when I was a freshman at Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] recruiters came to do voter registration and I went to southern Alabama.  But I didn't--I just got there.  I went on to Marion County, Alabama, where Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] was born to do voter registration.  But I made both marches from Selma [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama], or the first I should say on Bloody Sunday when I was there with Congressman John Lewis [HistoryMaker John Lewis].  And I wanna say about Congressman Lewis.  Congressman Lewis is not a black hero.  He's an authentic American hero.  And we were beaten and I still have the dog bite in my left leg.  But I saw the best of humanity but the worst of humanity at the very same time.  So, I've had a lot of milestones in my life, but I think the milestones have taught me something that I think is very important, that there's great humanity in America, there's also bad humanity in America, that we should not judge people by the color of their skin but basically as Dr. King said by the character--by the content of their character.  And I learned that from dad [Arthur Jackson].  My dad told me on his deathbed.  My dad died in November just two days before Thanksgiving in 1967.  And I was very bitter at that point in time after coming from Selma and Marion County.  And he said something, he said, "Remember son, that you had brothers and sisters of the lighter hue with you that suffered the same abuse that you did."  But what was most important, he said, is that--when I left, when I was getting ready to leave, he says, "You will never see me alive again, but I just wanted to have this conversation with you."  And we had a great conversation and I left out of the room, and within three hours, my father had died.  So, it's--you know, I've had a remarkable life.  But, it's, it's been very good.
Story_ID: 604641
Speaker 1: Let's go back to that incident when you were seven.  What happened?  I mean, you went running back home, I take it?  You, you and he were just walking, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, you went running back home.  What, what happened when you got home?  Because that is a pretty horrific thing for a child.
Speaker 2: My mom [Henrietta Green Jackson] and dad [Arthur Jackson] came with me, went back, and at that point in time, they were getting ready to remove his body.  And I remember distinctly my mom saying to me, "Did Ray Butler attack him?"  I said, "No, he did not. He just asked him to take his hand off of the, the lady."  Because Big Red [ph.] and I don't know his name today, said that he had attacked and he should--and he had to resist him.  And I said, "No, mom, he did not."  And let me say something to you because my mom and dad had a very unique position with their kids.  It might sound very funny, but I never lied once to my mom or dad, not once because we had such a great relationship.  I figured that if--they told me if I told the truth, I'd have no repercussion.  If I lied, I'd have repercussions.  And so I told her, I said, "He didn't do it."  And there was great protest over the shooting of Ray Butler, but nothing ever became of it.  Big Red didn't come back to the community after that happened, but he was not disciplined nor was he fired from the police department.  That was a very traumatic experience.
Speaker 1: Do you remember discussion or your parents trying to even explain what happened?  Or, or you sort of knew as a child that all was wrong.
Speaker 2: I knew it was wrong.  I knew it was wrong what he did.  There's no question about it.  And I was not bitter, but I couldn't understand how that could happen and, and nothing became of it, nothing.
Speaker 1: You weren't afraid of the white police after or the police officer for a while after that?
Speaker 2: Of course, I was afraid.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But in my community, we didn't see white people very often.  I mean, it--you know, it was--Dallas [Texas] was very segregated.  I lived in South Dallas [Dallas, Texas].  So in many ways, we lived across the, the street from teachers, from doctors, so we were all in one area.  The stores that we had, there were whites who owned the stores but basically black worked, worked in the stores to serve us, so our encounter was basically with policemen or firefighters, so I really didn't--I really didn't encounter whites on any level basically until I--until I really got into high school [St. Peter Academy, Dallas, Texas].
Story_ID: 604642
Speaker 1: Let's describe the community you grew up in.  I mean, first of all, your family is a community unto itself, but you're the--you're the--you're the little tike, so.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: How, how was it being the littlest in that--you know, first of all, let's describe how it was being the youngest in a--you know, a group of--
Speaker 2: First of all, my brothers and sisters were all stair stepped other than me.  There's a ten year gap between my sister and me.
Speaker 1: So you were the surprise child (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother [Henrietta Green Jackson] thought I was--my mother thought she had a tumor, so I'm the tumor baby (laughter).  And so--and my mother delivered me at about 3:30 in the morning time and delivered another baby at about eleven o'clock the same day.  (Laughter) I know, that sounds unbelievable, but she did.  They don't make them like that anymore.  So, my brothers and sisters always treated me like a novelty.  See, I have nephews and nieces older than me.  I remember my sister, Ruth [Annie Ruth Jackson], telling me that she and my sister, Lillian [Lillian Jackson (ph.)], didn't speak to my mother for a year because they couldn't believe she was having a baby and they had kids two and three years old, so it was--but they really loved me a lot.  They believed, and I don't want to sound arrogant, they believed that I was the gifted child of the family, that God had brought me along for, for a special reason.  I'm not sure that that's true, but my sister and brother who are living today still say the same thing, that, that I came along for a special purpose.  But they were very, very--they were very wonderful to me in a sense that I was the only one who went to Catholic schools and my brothers and sisters paid for my education because my father [Arthur Jackson] and mother really couldn't afford to it.  And they--my wife [Jackson's second wife, Marcia Jackson] tends to say I'm spoiled.  I probably am; I don't think so.  But, but they really treated me like I was a little king, so I, I, I have a great deal--I had a great deal of affection for my brothers and sisters.  They--I, I--my family's--my family, although today, nine of us--nine of them are dead, I was--I was--we were--we were a very, very close knit family and I, I just really am--I appreciate being one of twelve kids from my mom and my dad.  You know, my, my brother and sister that are still living today are just phenomenal.  We, we make sure we talk at least twice a week because we made a, a decision after Ruth died that we never thought we'd be in this situation that there's only three of us left out of twelve kids.  You never think about that.  And my sister, Ruth, and I were very, very close.  That's who took care of my mother, the two of us.  And I was--I was very hurt when she died and it's still very difficult for me to, to visit my mother and my sister's graves.  I can't, it's very difficult.
Story_ID: 604643
Speaker 1: The community you grew up in, what, what was that community like?
Speaker 2: Very unique in the sense that, you have to understand that during segregation, doctors, principals, teachers, foundry workers lived in the same community.  We didn't live in different communities.  And I will tell you, when we moved to Lawrence Street my freshman year in high school [St. Peter Academy, Dallas, Texas], we had arrived because we had a brick house and we had central air.  Before that, we had a water cooler.  So, moving there, I thought that it was just unbelievable.  My father [Arthur Jackson] was a very smart man, very frugal.  He said that the only, only credit you should ever have is your house.  He bought all of his cars outright.  He would save and buy the cars outright.  He did not believe in debt like most black people at that point in time didn't 'cause he came up during the Depression [Great Depression].  And in the process, so when we got that house, we lived across the street from Dr. Flowers [William Knox Flowers], lived down the street from Dr. Toles [ph.].  You've heard of Duane Thomas.  Duane Thomas was next door to us who played for the Cowboys [Dallas Cowboys].  Abner Haynes who played for the Dallas Texans [Kansas City Chiefs] was two doors on the other side.  His father was a bishop in the C.M.E. [Colored Methodist Episcopal; Christian Methodist Episcopal] church.  So, you had a very unique community in the sense that everybody was very respectful of everybody.  And even though my father had a fifth grade education, he was very active in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and so our community was just really full.  And that's the thing I think today is that we had role models around us that we could emulate and no one felt that they were better than anyone else in the community even though we knew that clearly, Dr. Flowers was, was the doctor.  It did not make any difference.  Or that Bishop Haynes [F.L. Haynes] was a bishop in the church or that Dr. Toles had a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois.  Everything--the kids played together.  It was a very, very unique community, which doesn't exist today, which really disturbs me in many ways.  It doesn't exist.  Secondly, we knew in that community that all those kids were going to college.  I mean, there was no doubt we were going to college.  And it didn't make any difference whether we went to a black college [HBCU] or an integrated college, we knew we were going to college, and that was--and academically, all of us did very well.  So, it was a community that was whole.  I don't like to use that term holistic.  It was a whole community and we spent a lot of time with each other.  And if I had to talk about it today, I can tell you that many of them are very successful.  We have doctors, lawyers.  We have--we have Ph.D.'s that came out of that community.  We have great athletes who came out of that community.  We have bishops of the C.M.E. church, the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church that came out of our community.  So, it was a real rich community that, that I came up in.  And I think that's had a lot to do with my perspective of myself.  See, I am--I tell people all the time, I like to joke.  I said, "I'd love me some [HistoryMaker] Alphonso Jackson," and I really do.  But I can--if I love me, then I can love everybody else, and that's very, very important.  That's the kind of civility and the kind of motivation that my mom [Henrietta Green Jackson] and dad gave me.  My dad, as I said before, was just a very rich human being.  I got a lot of whippings and that's probably why I don't know anything about Shakespeare [William Shakespeare].  My father used to quote Shakespeare when he whipped me, so, so I, I don't--I don't particularly care for Shakespeare.
Speaker 1: So he would really quote Shakespeare?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  My father knew everything Shakespeare wrote, everything.  And so he'd--but, you know, I was a little naughty kid I, I have to say.
Story_ID: 604644
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about that.  I, I mean, what--so how would you describe yourself as a young, you know, person?
Speaker 2: A young old person.  I never really--I never really played.  I mean, I was an athlete, but--well, let me back up.  Until I was eleven years old, I was a chronic asthmatic.  I was in the hospital probably two days out of every week.  At age eleven, the doctor at children's hospital [Children's Medical Center Dallas, Dallas, Texas] said to my mom [Henrietta Green Jackson] and dad [Arthur Jackson], if I live to be seventeen it would be a miracle 'cause I consistently had asthma attacks, almost every day.  And this nurse, this doctor from Sweden suggested--she had just come to the United States, suggested to my mom and dad that I begin to exercise and that's how I became a track star and, and I exercised my asthma out.  But, that's why I, I was on the board, vice chair of children's hospital in Dallas [Texas] 'cause they literally saved my life.  But, it was a--it was very, very, very difficult coming up early because I was a very sickly child.  You know, I'm premature.  I, I meant to tell you that.  I should be a November baby, but I was a September baby.  And so--and my mother was forty-six when she had me, so I had some serious problems at that point in time.  But in the end, I overcame all of those, those problems, so it's--it was very difficult at first, but my life has been so wonderful.  I, I just wish in many ways many of the black kids today could've had the experience that I had.  It was a segregated environment, but it was a wonderful experience in the sense that we really had no worries.  Other than me being sick, that was about the extent of it, of, of the bad, I would say, and I don't think that was really bad in the sense that--because it made me the person that I am today.
Story_ID: 604645
Speaker 1: --That community that you were discussing, and I'd like you to tell me what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up [in Dallas, Texas].
Speaker 2: It was a very calm community.  The community was, was very pleasant to live in.  The kids played a lot outside, but I--as I said, I was sickly.  I didn't play a lot outside.  I envied the--those who could play because we played stick ball, football, touch football, but at that point in time, I didn't do any of that.  So I used to spend a lot of time looking out of our window at, at the Johnsons [ph.], the Tucks [ph.] who played all the time.  They were very kind to me, but in many ways, I think they were very paternalistic because I was so sickly.  It was a wonderful community.  I mean, it was--I mean, we lived next door to the Joneses [ph.] and, you know, I'd go over and eat.  It was--it was like everybody was a big family.  And that might sound real corny, but that's literally the way it was.  I mean, I called my mom [Henrietta Green Jackson] and said, "I'm going to stay over to the Thomases."  Franklin [Franklin Thomas] was my age.  Duane [Duane Thomas] was a little younger than I was.  And I was in love with Dorothy [ph.], his sister, so I always liked to eat over there with them.  And so I'd say I'm gonna eat with the Thomases and my mother said, "Okay."  I mean, it was--it was just a--it was a really great community.  I mean, I looked at--you know, I, I was a--when Abner Haynes went to the Dallas Texans [Kansas City Chiefs], he took me with him.  I was the first water boy that was hired by Lamar Hunt.  So, it was like a--like a, a unique community.  When Duane Thomas went to the Dallas Cowboys, I mean, he made sure that I had tickets because we had all been raised up together.  And so it was a very, very--when Edgar [ph.] became a doctor, it was--it--you know, it was--his grandfather was a doctor, he became a doctor, his father was a doctor.  I mean, it was a--it was a very unique community in the sense that we, we gravitated toward each other.  And as I began to run track in high school [St. Peter Academy, Dallas, Texas] and got better, we just became closer and closer.  And today, I still talk to many of the people who lived in my community.  One young lady is a professor at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania].  Edgar is still practicing medicine.  James [ph.] is a--is a--is a major, I think at this point a captain in the police department.  So, we had a very unique community in a sense that we, we had a very whole environment.  And the other thing that was very important is, is that in, in the community, unlike today, we grew a lot of our own vegetables.  I mean, my--I remember my mother had a vegetable garden in the back.  Now, I don't know how large our lot was, but it seemed huge at that point in time and almost everyone on the street grew something and we would share it with each other during the season.  It was--it was a--it was a community that made you whole.  And I think that's why I, I have such a very positive attitude today is because of the community I came out of.
Story_ID: 604646
Speaker 1: Now, any sounds or smells?  You gave me sights.  Any sounds?
Speaker 2: I can't think of any sounds.  Smells, I always think of dogs 'cause everybody had a dog.  And I don't think we did too much washing of our dogs 'cause they didn't--at that time, unlike today, when I had a dog, they stay in the house.  They didn't live in the houses at that point.  My mom [Henrietta Green Jackson] and--wouldn't permit that and most of the moms didn't permit that.  So, we had little doghouses and et cetera and so on, so the thing that comes to me most is, is, is Blackie [ph.], our, our Chow [Chow Chow].  He smelled a lot (laughter), so.  I remember washing him one time and my mother said, "What are you washing him for?  'Cause he's gonna go back and get dirty again," (laughter), so I never washed him again.  That's the truth.  I just thought about that.  So, yeah, if anything I smell, it's dogs 'cause the dogs were all over us.  Everybody had a dog.
Speaker 1: Did a lot of barking, then that would be--
Speaker 2: That sounds, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of barking.  Yeah, I will say, yeah.  Franklin [Franklin Thomas]--I forget the name of his dog eventually had to remove him 'cause he wouldn't sleep at night and they were across the street from us.  He would bark the whole night, so I think that went on--I can't tell you, maybe, maybe six or seven months and then Mr. Thomas, I don't know what he did with him, but we, we removed him and got, got another dog.
Story_ID: 604647
Speaker 1: Tell me what school, what was your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Initially from, from first grade to fifth grade was H.S. Thompson [H.S. Thompson Elementary School, Dallas, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and from fifth grade to eighth grade was St. Anthony's [St. Anthony Catholic School; St. Anthony School, Dallas, Texas].  And then from ninth grade to twelfth grade was St. Peter's preparatory college [St. Peter Academy, Dallas, Texas].  Now, that's a--that's a very unique story in itself.  See, a lot of times people believe that racism and prejudice exists between black and whites, but it also exists between blacks.  In fifth grade, sixth grade is where we started the accelerated courses in elementary school and I tested very well, but we had a principal there.  I'll never forget him, H.R. Hollins [ph.] and he refused to permit me to go into the accelerated classes.  There's a dichotomy that existed in this country between very light-skinned and dark-skinned blacks, and most of the light-skinned blacks at that time were in the accelerated courses and their parents were teachers or whatever and H.R. Hollins was very, very fair.  I mean, it was very difficult to tell that he was black and he made a decision.  And at that time, Mr. Bell [ph.], who was my counselor, we had counselor, came to our house and, and talked to my mom [Henrietta Green Jackson] and dad [Arthur Jackson] and suggested that, that I go to a Catholic school or go somewhere else because I was too bright to be in the regular classrooms, and I ended up going to St. Anthony's.
Speaker 1: Now, who was Mr. Bell?  Was he the--
Speaker 2: Mr. Bell was my fourth grade teacher--
Speaker 1: Teacher, okay.
Speaker 2: --and, but he also followed me all the way and today, we're still very, very close friends.
Speaker 1: So, he saw the promise in you.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And my mom went over to see Dr. Hollins and just said, "He's not gonna fit."  I'll never forget what he said to my mom, "He's not gonna fit in that environment."  And so my mom took me out of school and I went--ended up going to St. Anthony.
Story_ID: 604648
Speaker 1: What was your, your, your parents' religion, your family religion?  Was it--were you--
Speaker 2: My family's religion, they were Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so going over to a Catholic school [St. Anthony Catholic School; St. Anthony School, Dallas, Texas]--
Speaker 2: I had to become Catholic at that time.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I spent the summer taking Catholicism, they called it catechism courses because you couldn't go to Catholic school at that point if you weren't Catholic, so I was the only Catholic in my family, and--
Speaker 1: So, that was an oddity, split existence, right?
Speaker 2: That's--split existence.  And I think the really funny thing about it is when I became Catholic, my mother [Henrietta Green Jackson] didn't want me to go to the Baptist church.  And I used to walk past Pilgrim Rest [Pilgrim Rest Missionary Baptist Church, Dallas, Texas] from St. Anthony [St. Anthony Catholic Church, Dallas, Texas] every Sunday morning and I can tell you, they were having a good time and I asked my mom, "Can I go down to the church?"  And she would say, "No, you're Catholic, you can't go."  'Cause in her mind, that made you very sophisticated, okay, and she never said it, but I, I could--I could discern that is the reason that she didn't want me at the Baptist church, okay.  So, for eight year--for six years, I basically went to Catholic church.  I was an altar boy and when I went off to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], I had a very good friend.  William [ph.] was his name, but we called him Willie B., and I went to--he lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I went to Mount Olive Baptist Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with him one Sunday morning, and I was extremely fulfilled.  And I called my mother and I said, "Mom," I said, "I'm no longer a Catholic," (laughter), so I said I really love the Baptist church, but I ended up basically being a United Methodist most of my life and still today, I'm a United Methodist.  But, I never went back to, to a Catholic church after I went to Mount Olive.
Speaker 1: That's a cute story.  So, from fourth to seventh when you are in still, you know, in Catholic school, you're still--
Speaker 2: Fifth to seventh.
Speaker 1: Fifth to seventh, I'm sorry.  You're still--you know, have your asthmatic condition, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct.
Story_ID: 604649
Speaker 1: So, what is this young person like?  You know, 'cause you said that you were a little mischievous.  Are you--you know, 'cause when you spend time sometimes, you know, you sort of live inside your head, but I'm just wondering, you know, what, what you were?  You know, you said you were--you had a lot of attention.
Speaker 2: I'm not the same person that I--today that I was then 'cause I was very introverted.  And I think in many ways I'm still very introverted.  Most people think I'm very extroverted.  But I like people.  But when you're sick, you really don't interact very much with anybody basically but my mom [Henrietta Green Jackson] and my dad [Arthur Jackson].  I used to get up every morning at five o'clock.  I still today get up at 5:30 to exercise and, and I don't--I don't need an alarm clock to get up because I used to get up every morning to, to be with my dad.  That was the only time really I had to see him other than on the weekends.  And once I had breakfast with him, and that's when I found out I couldn't drink coffee, okay, because not only did the coffee beans exacerbate the asthma attack, it really made me hyper, too.  So today, I don't drink anything.  And it's not caffeine, it's actually the coffee beans themselves.  And so I'd get up, but I was very introverted.  I spent a lot of time.  I used to read ferociously.  I mean, I--I'm--I was a great reader because I couldn't exercise.  My mother wouldn't let me exercise, so I spent most of the time indoors when I wasn't in school or when I wasn't in the hospital.  You know, at that time, they put us in, in, in what we call iron lungs, those big round machines to breathe, and we had these atomizers that I took with me everywhere that I went.  So, I didn't have very many friends.  So, I was--as I said, I was a young old person.  You have to understand, my mom and dad was old and--
Speaker 1: Do you know how old they were at the time you were growing up?
Speaker 2: My father was forty-eight when I was born, my mother was forty-six.
Speaker 1: Six.
Speaker 2: So, at ten, she was fifty-six, he was fifty-eight.
Story_ID: 604650
Speaker 1: --When you go to Catholic school, what is the experience like for you?  'Cause it's a lot of new and different things.
Speaker 2: You know, I tell people all the time, I had the very--the, the most unique educational experience at St. Anthony [St. Anthony Catholic School; St. Anthony School, Dallas, Texas] and St. Peter's [St. Peter Academy, Dallas, Texas] that anybody could have, and they always say why?  Because I never had a black teacher from fifth grade all the way up to high school, to finishing high school.  They were nuns and priests and they were all white, but we had a segregated school.  Now, the only thing I can say about the Diocese of Dallas [Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas] is we didn't get leftover books.  We got the same books that Jesuit [Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, Dallas, Texas] got, that Ursuline [Ursuline Academy of Dallas, Dallas, Texas], that any of the other Catholic schools, but we had no white kids in our school.  And the only black person was Mrs. Kidd [ph.] who taught physical education and, and Mr. Finty [ph.] who was the football coach.  Other than that, everybody who taught us or dealt with us were white priests or nuns.  And we shared classes in chemistry, math, but otherwise, the boys was--were with the Josephite fathers and the girls were with the Josephite nuns.  So it was a very unique experience in the sense that we got a phenomenal--there were eighty-nine people in my class.  Eighty-five of us have degrees and of the eighty-five that have degrees, I think seventy-seven or seventy-eight of us have advanced degrees, but they were all black, and that's just, just the nature--see, Dallas [Texas] high schools did not integrate until two years after I left high school.  I graduated in '64 [1964].  They integrated in 1966.  So, we had a very unique education.  And you have to understand that to get into St. Peter's, it was very, very difficult because everybody wanted their kids to go to St. Peter's.  It was just--it was very competitive, and so most of the kids who were there did very well on the standardized test that we had to take, and we took the same standardized test that they took at the other Catholic schools.  So in that sense, education was really full but very difficult because I didn't have anybody teaching me who looked like me.  They all had habits or caps on, when we say--we call these caps by the priests.
Speaker 1: Were they fair?  Were they--you know, they were fair in their treatment of kids?  'Cause remember you said--
Speaker 2: Only one nun [Sister Bartholomew (ph.)] I can remember that, that consistently used the--she was from Ireland, consistently used the N word, yeah (laughter), consistently.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But the others were.  In fact, my favorite person was Sister Regina [ph.].  I will never forget her.  She was the principal of the girls school, but she also taught chemistry and, and we had a very special bond.  In fact, when she became very ill, she ended up spending two months with us because I asked her to come up to go to, to Barnes-Jewish [Barnes-Jewish Hospital] in St. Louis [Missouri] for the cancer because they had a very, very good cancer center there.  And we literally--I literally paid for everything for her.  And she just died about three years ago, but she was--she was my favorite and she was such a wonderful human being.  She had a very, very tremendous effect on my life because she, she taught me a lot about humanities.  She was just a wonderful human being.
Speaker 1: And did she teach some--one subject or she was one of the--
Speaker 2: She was principal--
Speaker 1: Principal.
Speaker 2: --but she taught chemistry.
Speaker 1: She taught chemistry.
Speaker 2: And so, that was one of the subjects that the boys and girls took together.
Story_ID: 604651
Speaker 1: Now, were you good at any particular subject?  Like, did you gravitate more towards math and science or were you more literary when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: I was absolutely horrible at math and, and science.  I wanted to be a doctor and I realized that, that in the end, I didn't have the math skills.  But I--but I was a prolific writer.  And I--that's why--I was a professor at the University of Missouri [University of Missouri - St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], taught constitutional law, conflicts of law.  I knew I wrote well.  And, you know, if you look at my, my resume and my, my biography, I published heavily.  But I always wrote well, so I ended up being an attorney because I knew I could write.  I really wanted to be a doctor, but I didn't have the skills and--to really, to really do well.
Story_ID: 604652
Speaker 1: How did the running--you know, the--you said the one doctor [at Children's Medical Center Dallas, Dallas, Texas], that Swedish, recommended to your parents [Henrietta Green Jackson and Arthur Jackson] that you start exercising, but that's a big leap from becoming, you know, a very good sprinter.  So, I mean, so that's what I'm just trying to understand.  And, you know, usually nerds don't go and, you know, they're--you know, athletes, so that's--
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't a sprinter initially.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was--I, I started running and the more I ran, I liked it.  I was a distance runner.  So, in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --seventh--I mean, in seventh, eighth grade I was a half miler.  Of course, they call it the 800 meters now.  And I was really good at the 800 meters.  But what happened is, my ninth grade year at St. Peter's [St. Peter Academy, Dallas, Texas], we had a guy there who was a sprinter, one of the best sprinters in the--in the Catholic league, and we were just horsing around and, and our coach at that point in time, Mr. Lark [ph.], said, "Well, I'm gonna put the distance runners against the sprinters," and we ran a--the 440 then, which is now the 4 x 100 relay.  And when I got the baton, he was about two steps ahead of me and I zipped past him (laughter).  And--Jerry Shackelforth [ph.], that's his name, Jerry told Mr. Lark, "I was just kidding, I can beat him."  And so I don't know whether it was two days later or a week later, Mr. Lark had us to run 100 yard dash and I beat him by six, six or seven yards and I became a sprinter.  So that's literally how I--otherwise, I probably would've been a half miler or an 800 meters person.  That's how I ended up being a sprinter.  And I had to make a decision 'cause I also was a, a good tennis player and they were both the same season.  But I was fourth seed on the tennis team, but I was number one on the track team, so I ended up going, going toward track.
Speaker 1: And that is in what grade?
Speaker 2: That's ninth grade.
Speaker 1: That's ninth grade.  Now, ninth grade, you started high school.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was at St.--
Speaker 2: St. Peter's.
Speaker 1: St. Peter's, okay.  And let's talk--so were you--so you're talking about in your ninth grade year when you aud- or tried out, sorry.
Speaker 2: I was a--I was a half miler in my seventh and eighth grade year at St. Anthony [St. Anthony Catholic School; St. Anthony School, Dallas, Texas] because we had a track team in St. Anthony--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --but it was an elementary track team.  So, I got to high school and I was a half miler.  That's how I started out.  And just by accident, I became a sprinter.
Story_ID: 604653
Speaker 1: So, now what was high school [St. Peter Academy, Dallas, Texas] like for you?
Speaker 2: Very competitive but very peaceful.  We had some very, very smart people in our school.  And the one thing I remember most about, almost everybody had a mom and dad there.  'Cause we'd have mom and dad night and the mom and dads would show up.  I mean, that, that to me, which doesn't exist today, really bothers me a lot.  So, we were--basically, all of us were basically very well balanced.  And I can remember the, the kids.  We had some extremely smart kids in our class, like Ray Wilkinson [ph.], who is now, I think, still a full professor at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] in math, Don Hard [ph.] who is now a full professor.  I'm not sure where he is.  I know he was at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] for a while.  But, we had some very smart kids in our class.  So, we were very competitive but very helpful.  It, it was a--other than Sister Bartholomew [ph.], it was a very nurturing community.  I mean, the nuns and the priests were just, just absolutely--she was the one who used the N word frequently.  And I think my junior year if I remember correctly, either my sophomore or my junior year, they ended up removing her from the school.
Story_ID: 604654
Speaker 1: You're--you know, you're active in, you know, in the track team, you're competing.  You compete--do you--do you compete statewide at that point?
Speaker 2: Statewide.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're developing a name for your--you know, yourself.  Now, was your track team one of the best track teams in the state?  No?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) No, I was one of the--I ended up being the, the best sprinter in the State of Texas in '67 [1967], '68 [1968], public or private.  There were three of us and you--one was George Aldredge who was at Highland Park [Highland Park High School, Dallas, Texas], a very rich community.  The other was Warren McVea who you've heard about from San Antonio [Texas] and myself.  And Mr. Lark [ph.] got me a chance to, to participate in the public school track meets, which was rare because at that point in time, they were segregated.  So you couldn't run against--the black high schools could not run against the white high schools in Dallas [Texas], but I had a chance, opportunity to run and beat George Aldredge in high school, and to beat Warren McVea.  Now, you have to understand how things were in Texas.  If you were in south Texas, San Antonio and south, schools were integrated, but if you were in north Texas starting with Waco [Texas] above, schools were totally segregated.  And so Warren McVea was in an integrated environment down in San Antonio at Brackenridge [G.W. Brackenridge High School] and I was--I was not.  And so when I ran against George Aldredge, it was because I was at the Catholic high school [St. Peter Academy, Dallas, Texas] that they permitted that.  Because the bishop at that time talked to the athletic director in the Dallas public school system [Dallas Independent School District] and he permitted me to run in the meet.  And I was the only black to, to run in a white meet at that time and that was '67 [1967] and '68 [1968].  So, I knew there was a difference.  Now, we could compete against all the Catholic high schools even though they were white all over Texas, but we didn't compete necessarily against public schools.  So half of our, our--plus, plus I played football, too, my sophomore, junior, and senior year.  We would play Catholic high schools in Texas, but when we played public schools, we would play segregated public schools like in Ennis [Texas], Waco, Tyler, Texas.
Story_ID: 604655
Speaker 1: You know, you said it was always assumed that everyone would go to college.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And let's talk about, you know, how you decided to go--you know, what college you were looking at and how your decision was made.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't make the decision, my dad [Arthur Jackson] did.  When I left high school [St. Peter Academy, Dallas, Texas], I was one of the best sprinters in the country.  I got accepted to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and to USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].  My father wouldn't permit me to go to either one of them because he said I wouldn't graduate and he, he actually knew more than me.  'Cause I love women, so I probably wouldn't have graduated out in California.  I mean, I really wouldn't have graduated.  So, he said, "I'll let you take one track scholarship."  I said, "Where is that?"  He said, "You can--." Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] wanted me very badly.  He says, "You can go to Notre Dame."  Well, I went up to Notre Dame, but I went up to Notre Dame in February.  There was like twenty-five, twenty-six inches of snow, so I called my mom [Henrietta Green Jackson] when I was up there, I said, "Something is wrong with these people."  She said, "What do you mean, son?"  She always said son.  I said, "Snow is up to my knees and these people are acting like there's no snow around here," and I said, "It's cold."  So she said--when I got back, I said, "I am not going to Notre Dame."  Now, that shows you how unsophisticated I was because when I decided to go to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], I didn't realize it got just as cold in Pennsylvania, but I went to Lincoln in the spring.  And so in the end, my dad says, "Are you going to Notre Dame?"  I said, "No, sir, I'm not.  It's too cold."  And so my father's--one of his best friends was a person who you probably know very well named Melvin Bernard Tolson [sic. Melvin Beaunorus Tolson].  He was the poet laureate of Liberia.  He wrote the 'Dark Symphony' and he had graduated from Lincoln University, and his classmate had been Thurgood Marshall and others.  And so he said, "Well why don't you go to Lincoln?  That's, that's the Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] for, for, for black men," and it was.  Lincoln was the very first black university [HBCU] for, for, for black people period in this country.  And I said, "Oh, I like it."  I went up and visited and I liked it and I ended up going to Lincoln University.  But, the, the irony is, is I didn't know how cold it got in Pennsylvania either.  And when I got there, I'll never forget, first year I was there, we had like twenty-seven inches of snow in November and I told my mom, I said, "Something is wrong with these people, too," but I couldn't leave.  So, that's how I really got to Lincoln.
Story_ID: 604656
Speaker 1: My father [Arthur Jackson] had a philosophy.  He said, "You can run track," he said, "but you're going to school for an education, and what I want to stress with you more is the education," and so that's why I ended up taking an academic scholarship.
Speaker 2: So, you--so, did Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] have a good track team at the time?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: That's what I was--
Speaker 1: I didn't run--I didn't run track for Lincoln.  I ran for the Philadelphia Pioneers [Philadelphia Pioneer Club], which was a track club when I got there.  It was so funny because--what's his name?  I see his face.  It will come to me, who was the track coach for the Philadelphia Pioneers realized that I had come to Lincoln, and within two weeks after I got to Lincoln, he came to see me and asked me if I would run for the club and I said yes because Lincoln really didn't have a track team.  They had a great soccer team and a great rugby team, but I didn't know what that was.  Because in Texas, we didn't play soccer or rugby, so that, that was new to me.
Story_ID: 604657
Speaker 1: And you were there how long then?
Speaker 2: At Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I was there a year.
Speaker 1: A year and then your father [Arthur Jackson]--
Speaker 2: My father--
Speaker 1: --got ill (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) became ill and I ended up transferring to, to Truman State [Northeast Missouri State Teachers College; Truman State University] which is in Missouri [Kirksville, Missouri] to try to get closer to my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and the reason I went to Truman State, it's important to understand.  SMU [Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas] really wanted me, but I would have to sit out a year in order to run.  At that point, they had just integrated.  Jerry LeVias had just come to SMU.  But at Truman State, they run a quarter system, so if I went there in the summer and then the fall, I would be eligible to run in the spring.  And Jumbo Elliott [James F. Elliott] at Villanova [Villanova University, Villanova, Pennsylvania] and our coach, Kenneth Gardner, were great friends.  And so, he wanted me at Villanova, but I would have to lay out a year there, also, same as SMU.  And so he said, "Why don't you go with my friend, Kenneth Gardner?"  And I, I ended up going to Truman State.  And, and let me tell you this.  That's one of the greatest experiences I've had in my life.  Kenneth Gardner was one of the finest human beings I've ever come in contact in my life, the fairest human being.  But what's most important, he did something that was not done back then or even today.  Every one of his black athletes graduated.  He insisted that we get an education.  And in many cases, he didn't want us majoring in physical education.  He wanted us to have a substantive area to major in.
Story_ID: 604658
Speaker 1: --Texas A and M Commerce [East Texas State University; Texas A&M University - Commerce, Commerce, Texas], then?
Speaker 2: What I did is I--when my father [Arthur Jackson] first became ill, I went there.  My father did not want me down there.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you made three changes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I went to--I went to Texas A and M at Commerce the, the--
Speaker 1: I see and that's where Delmer Brown was.
Speaker 2: That's right and I had a serious problem with him.
Speaker 1: You did? Oh, god, I thought he was--okay.  I had like--okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: You know who was--else was down there with me?
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] John Carlos.
Speaker 1: John Carlos was there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: No way.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We both left.  Delmer Brown was a true racist.
Speaker 1: Oh.  I'll be darned because he was very--he had taken a, a team to the Olympics, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, Delmer Brown was a--
Speaker 1: He was--
Speaker 2: --was a top notch sprinter himself.
Speaker 1: He was--
Speaker 2: He and his brother.
Speaker 1: Wow.  This is fascinating.  Oh my goodness, okay.  Well, 'cause I'm like--I'm like, what did I--there's something about these universities.  Okay, now I--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, I got it.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I seldom talk about that.
Speaker 1: I see.  But we've got a nice picture of you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, let me see.
Speaker 1: On the--right there with the--sitting--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --next to him.
Speaker 2: That--that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm so--I thought that was your mentor.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh my god.  Okay, okay, okay.  Now, okay--well, we should--okay, but it's, you know, like we--you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, I seldom talk about that, but I'll be happy to talk about it with you.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay, okay.  So, let's, let's, let's do the chronology.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you, you first went to--
Speaker 2: When I left Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], I went to, to--what was--East Texas State University at that time.  Now, it's Texas A and M at Commerce.
Speaker 1: It, it was A and--okay, right, right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Because I wanted to be very close to my dad.  And in the final analysis, it was the worst experience I've ever had in my life other than Ray Butler.  Delmer Brown--I was the first black to be on the track team there and that's when I called back to Jumbo Elliott [James F. Elliott] and says, "I can't deal with this," and he told me about Kenneth Gardner.  But the year I was there, I was a very good sprinter, but it was just a very unique experience.  Delmer Brown would never talk to me and he used the N word profusely, profusely.  And yet I was winning that year, but it didn't make any difference.  So, I didn't finish the track season with him.  I ended up leaving.  I, I shouldn't say leaving, I finished the seme- the school year with him, but I didn't finish the track season with him because I couldn't take it.  And my father said you're not going back, and so I had to find a school.  And let me tell you how I was eligible to run down there because they were in the NAIA [National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics], not the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association].  And so even if you're in the NAIA, that was another division.  Even if you ran in the NAIA, you had to still sit out a year, and so that's when I went my junior year to Truman State [Northeast Missouri State Teachers College; Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri].
Story_ID: 604659
Speaker 1: Delmer Brown, he had been a very good sprinter himself in--
Speaker 2: Unbelievable, top notch sprinter, he and his brother, both.  They were back in the '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s], were top notch sprinters.
Speaker 1: And, and you--also, you said [HistoryMaker] John Carlos had--
Speaker 2: John Carlos came right after I left and that's how John and I got to be friends because John called me one morning when I was at Truman State [Northeast Missouri State Teachers College; Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri] and he said, "Why did you leave?"  I said, "You will know why."  And John only lasted one year, too.  Then, he went out to San Jose [San Jose State College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California].
Speaker 1: Right.  Wow, that's very good piece of history.  So, you, you couldn't take that, so it was like, you know, I wanna say silent neglect.  You know, you were like invisible--visible but invisible.  No.
Speaker 2: He was pleased that I was there because I was winning but he wouldn't talk to me.  He wrote out my, my regiment.  He wrote it out.  And I'll never forget, we were eating one day in the athletic--it wasn't a dormitory but an athletic room where we ate, and I said something to him and he said, "I don't like Ns," and I said, "Neither do I."  That was basically the--really the only conversation we had with each other in a whole year.  See, you have to understand.  When I went there at East Texas [East Texas State University; Texas A&M University - Commerce, Commerce, Texas], he was forced to integrate because the president says, "We gotta have black athletes."  So that was the year that we had two to come on the basketball team, three to come on the football team, and me, came on the track team, that was it.
Speaker 1: So, how was the relationship between you and your other teammates then given that behavior?
Speaker 2: I talked to two of them, only two.  Only two basically talked to me.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I can point them out to you when you want to, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Do you remember their names?  I got--there's a whole bunch of them here.
Speaker 2: Do you have their names?
Speaker 1: Pete Gardner, Terry Burnett, Mike Flanagan, Robert Miller, Russel Polhemus, Leroy Davis, Tom Clark, Basil Clark, Richard Nichols.
Speaker 2: Basil Clark.
Speaker 1: Basil Clark, Richard Nichols, Michael O'Neal, Tim Blank [sic. Tim Price], Morris Kyser, Eddie Vinson.
Speaker 2: Morris Kyser.
Speaker 1: Morris Kyser and Basil Clark.
Speaker 2: Basil Clark, basically.  Basil was from Highland Park [Texas], really tremendous guy.  They're basically the only two really who talked to me.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: You have to understand, my regiment other than when we worked on the 4 x 100 relay or the 880 relay, they, they really didn't talk to me.  It was--it was a--it was a very unique environment.  It was a--
Speaker 1: But when you say your regiment, what were you getting ready to say.  Your regiment was--
Speaker 2: Well, they--he, he wrote out what he wanted me to do.  He gave me--he had--he had a sheet of paper where he talked to the other people.  He would write out my regiment for the week, that's what he would do.  See, he didn't wanna integrate.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: He did not.  That was a forced situation.  In many ways, he reminds me a lot of Bear Bryant.  You know, Bear Bryant said, "It'll be a cold day in hell before I integrate my football teams," and the cold day in hell did come.  So, Delmer Brown was exactly the same way.
Speaker 1: So, those, those black students that were recruit--I mean, you know, in the, you said football.  Were they there too?
Speaker 2: They were there with me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you guys form a little team there?  No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.  And then you had a lot going on at home.
Speaker 2: Most of the--most of the, the, the football players, basketball players were very much like today.  They were not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --very intellectual.  And they didn't spend any time studying, and so I spent a lot of time studying.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: I mean, I ended up, the year I was there I think I had like a 3.7 on, on, on a scale of a, a 4.0 [grade point average].  So, I studied a lot and I went home every weekend to see about my dad [Arthur Jackson].
Speaker 1: And your father, he passed away this, this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My junior year.
Speaker 1: Junior year, not that--
Speaker 2: At, at Truman State.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  So, by that time, you're at--
Speaker 2: Truman State.
Speaker 1: At Truman State.
Speaker 2: Or Northeast Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, Truman State.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.  Okay, okay.  This helps a lot.  Okay.  I mean, it says it but, okay, it was--
Speaker 2: I never talk about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because that was an experience that was not very pleasant to me.
Speaker 1: I see.  Yeah, I just--it just had this picture and I'm thinking, oh gosh, he's a prize sprinter (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, you know it's so funny because, I guess it was three years ago, they did a whole feature of me in, in Texas A and M Commerce magazine.  They were so very proud, et cetera and so on.  And when she came to talk to me and she said, "Why didn't you stay?"  And I said, "Well, do you want the truth or you just want me to give you an answer?"  And she said, "The truth."  And when I talked to the lady who interviewed me and I told her about Delmer Brown, and she said, "Yeah, that's the history."  She said, "Now, you know, the same thing happened to John Carlos."  I said, "I know" (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's amazing.  Wow (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 604660
Speaker 1: You go there and it's because you--of--that he, he recruited you?  What happened?  You go--you say, I can't do this.
Speaker 2: No, what happened was, was this.
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: The president of the university [East Texas State University; Texas A&M University - Commerce, Commerce, Texas] at that time realized that integration was going to occur and that athletes were gonna go.  So, Delmer had seen me run at the Penn Relays [Penn Relay Carnival].  So when I inquired about schools, I knew I couldn't go to SMU [Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas] because I'd have to sit out a year.  So, I wrote Delmer Brown and said, "Look, my father [Arthur Jackson] is sick, I'd like to come there."  He didn't write me back.  The athletic director wrote me back and says, "Yes, we'd like to have you and we'll give you a track scholarship."  That was the way it happened.  'Cause I wrote schools.  And let me tell you, I wrote the schools in the NAIA [National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics], which was different from the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association].  And--
Speaker 1: Now, what was the difference between them back then?
Speaker 2: I was eligible to run in an NAIA school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I would not be eligible to run in an NCAA school.
Speaker 1: Because of segregation?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because the rules--
Speaker 1: Once--oh, that's right, you had to sit out.  Okay.
Speaker 2: You had to sit out--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a whole year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I got you.
Speaker 2: And so my family was not in a position to pay for my education, so I had to find a way to, to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, then when you, you say I can't do this anymore and then--but what happens?  Are you recruited then to--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let me say this to you.  Jumbo Elliott [James F. Elliott] had told me about Northeast Missouri [Northeast Missouri State Teachers College; Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri] at first.
Speaker 1: Okay. Oh, I see.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't wanna be that far away from my dad.  See, I could come home every weekend at Commerce.  You, you have to understand that Commerce is only an hour and ten minutes from, from Dallas [Texas], so I wanted to be near my father.  But at the end of the year, I called Coach Gardner [Kenneth Gardner] who I had talked to before, the year, my, my--at the end of my freshman year and I said, "I'd really like to come to Truman State."  And he had seen me down at the Texas Relays [Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays] because at that time, I had finished third in the hundred [100 yard dash] at Texas Relay.  He said, "I'd love to have you," he said, "but you've gotta come in the summertime because you--you'll be qualified to run in the spring at the NCAA."  That's how it happened.
Speaker 1: So, this was the summer between your sophomore and junior year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Summer of '66 [1966].
Story_ID: 604661
Speaker 1: With Coach Gardener [Kenneth Gardner], it's a much different experience.
Speaker 2: Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  It was--it was a wonderful experience.  I mean, he, he was just--I was very bitter, having been with Delmer Brown [at East Texas State University; Texas A&M University - Commerce, Commerce, Texas], very bitter, and that topped having been to Selma, Alabama, my freshman year [at Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  I was very bitter and Coach Gardner was very patient, I mean very, very patient.  And I have to tell you this, it was (laughter)--it was very much almost like Delmer Brown.  I was acting like Delmer Brown.  I said, "Write out my regiment for me." I didn't wanna talk to him, I really didn't.  And every weekend, Mrs. Gardner would cook because they didn't cook for the athletes on the weekend.  And at first I, I wouldn't eat her food and--'cause I was just--I was very bitter and, and she was very patient.  She's a wonderful--she was a wonderful lady and she'd say, "Okay, you don't have to eat it," she said, "but you're gonna really be hungry later on tonight," (laughter), and so--and then she'd talk to me and she'd say, "Why are you so bitter?"  And I wouldn't basically talk to her.  But Coach Gardner was so smart.  He was a real smart individual, I mean a West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] graduate.  He was just really smart and he would not say anything.  He let me get all of my venom out of me.  And I'll never forget, we were on our way to Kansas Relays and it was on a Thursday.  We were gonna leave later on that afternoon and he called me in the office.  And he said to me, he said, "Alphonso [HistoryMaker Alphonso Jackson], this can't go on like this."  I said, "What do you mean?"  He said, "Either we're gonna be a team or we're not gonna be a team.  I'm not gonna continue to write your regiments.  You're gonna work out with everybody else."  And he said, "Why are you so bitter?"  And, you know, I told him at that point in time, and I'll never forget what he did.  He called my mother [Henrietta Green Jackson] and he said, "I'm gonna send him home," he said, "because either he's gonna be part of this team or he's not."  And my mother called me and she said, "You better get--." Basically, "You better get your act together." And I went in there very bitter to Coach Gardner and I was not very nice.  I was not very nice, what I said to him, and--but that's when we got to be friends, that day 'cause he was a big man, like 6'4", 6'5", 220, 230 pounds.  And he caught me by the collar and threw me up against the wall.  He said, "Son, you don't talk to me that way."  He says, "You're going home."  And I started crying.  I said, "I can't go home."  I said, "My mother said I can't come home," and that was the day we became friends.
Speaker 1: Wow.  That's a nice story.  So, from that point on, that was the beginning of your junior year [at Northeast Missouri State Teachers College; Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Story_ID: 604662
Speaker 1: And so your father passed away--
Speaker 2: November.
Speaker 1: --in--
Speaker 2: Two days before Thanksgiving.
Speaker 1: I see.  And, and so, so what do you--that's a hard--was it hard to finish out the year [at Northeast Missouri State Teachers College; Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri]?  Or because you knew your father had been dying, was it--
Speaker 2: I knew he had been dying.  See, my father was, was a very strong man and I think I took a lot from him.  And when my father was first diagnosed with cancer of the lungs, the social worker came to see my father and she said, "Mr. Arthur [Arthur Jackson]," she says, "you're entitled to four things: social security, social security supplement, welfare, and food stamps."  And my father in his whispering voice said, "No," he says, "I've only earned two, social security and social security supplement."  He said, "There will be no food stamps and no welfare in this house."  He said, "If we get to the point we can't eat," he said, "we'll go down to our church," which was Pilgrim Rest [Pilgrim Rest Missionary Baptist Church, Dallas, Texas], I told you, "and we'll--they'll provide food for us."  That taught me something very important, that even though he was dying, he still kept his sense of worth of who he was, and he would not compromise that.  And to me, that said a lot about my father.  And that's probably why the way I am today in the sense that I am.  He set the pace.  So, I knew he was dying.  The doctor gave him six months, but he ended up living two more years.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, he was a very strong man.  In many ways, I wish he hadn't lived two more years because the last time I saw him, he was not the father that I knew because he was--he was basically a, a fetus in many ways, just a large fetus.
Speaker 1: I understand.  It's hard 'cause my father [HistoryMaker Julius Richardson] is sick now.  So you finish--you--did--how was your track season that first year?
Speaker 2: Excellent.
Speaker 1: It was, okay.
Speaker 2: Excellent, excellent.
Speaker 1: Both--then, both your junior and senior year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very excellent.  I was an All-American.  See, I miss my father tremendously but my father prepared me--
Speaker 1: For it.
Speaker 2: --for his death.  He knew he was going to die and he is the one I mean who really prepared me.  That's why today, I don't feel--I don't fear death.  I mean, my father had a saying, "As sure as you're born, you're gonna die."  The greatest thing he used to say about death is you don't know when.  "'Cause if we knew when," he used to say, "we would act crazy."  So, my dad is right, so I don't--that's not something that I fear.  And so when he died, he told me, "Don't be sad."  He said, "You go on about your business.  I've had a great life, I'm really proud of you, you better graduate."  I mean, I--that was one of the last thing he said, "You better graduate."  And then I look back now and I said, you know, "My dad was real smart."  'Cause I still say if I had gone to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] or USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], I wouldn't have graduated, out there with all those ladies in California, with no clothes on?  I'd have been in trouble.  So, he knew what he was doing.  He knew I wasn't mature enough to, to, to go out there.  Today, I could do it.
Story_ID: 604663
Speaker 1: Now why did you major in political science [at Northeast Missouri State Teachers College; Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to be a doctor, but I didn't--I didn't--I couldn't deal with the sciences, so I knew I could write.  And so the, the easiest thing to do was to, to major in political science.  Because I have a B.A. in political science and I have a bachelor's of--bachelor's of science degree in social science.  So I had history.  Yeah, I have two bachelor's [degree].
Speaker 1: How did you get the two bachelor's?  Now you're confusing me more.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I--
Speaker 1: Oh, you double majored.
Speaker 2: I double majored.
Speaker 1: You double majored.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: In order to get--in order to get a B.A., you had to take a foreign language, so I took the foreign language, but I also took the, the minimum courses in political science and the minimum courses in the social sciences.
Speaker 1: Okay, I double--okay.  Okay.  Excuse me.  I double majored.  I forget about that.
Story_ID: 604664
Speaker 1: So you graduate.  Do you remember graduation day?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My sister and my brother came up and I had my oldest daughter [Annette Jackson Watkins] there who was about--no, she hadn't been born at the graduation.
Speaker 1: So, you had gotten married?
Speaker 2: I had gotten married [to Bernadine Moore Jackson] my senior year.  She wasn't born yet.  But my sister and brother-in-law came up--my brother--sister and brother-in-law and my brother came up.  And it was--it was really wonderful because Mrs. Gardner and Coach Gardner [Kenneth Gardner] had a big feast for us in the backyard at the end of graduation, so I'll never forget that.  Because it was Freddy [Fred Banks], Ron Davis, Michael--what's his name?  Michael--can't think of Mich- Michael Krumeich [sic.], Krumeich--Jerry Krumeich, and they gave us a big feast.  It was really, really very good, and it was a wonderful experience.  I mean, I--Kirksville [Missouri] was just a wonderful experience.  I mean, there wasn't very many black students on campus [Northeast Missouri State Teachers College; Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri].  Out of seven thousand students, we probably had two hundred black students on campus, but we had a very, very cohesive group of kids on campus and we really looked out for each other.  But what was so great about Kirksville in my mind is that it was basically an all-white town of about twenty-two thousand people.  They hadn't had any experience basically with blacks, and they were very nice.  I remember an incident that happened in Rider's drugstore [Rider Drug, Inc., Kirksville, Missouri].  I went in there right after I had gotten up there, not, not that summer, I think the fall.  And I was looking for some shaving cream, I remember distinctly.  And this little white girl, must--maybe, maybe five, maybe six, I'm not sure, and she looked around the corner and put her head back, and then she looked around the corner again and put her head back.  Then she looked again and put her head back, and then when she and her mother was walking by, she said, "Mom, there's a chocolate man," (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's so cute.
Speaker 2: That's cute.  I mean, that's what she thought.  I was a chocolate man.  And it shows you basically how pure she was, okay.  And I'll never forget that and I--that's--that was my fond- one of my fondest memories of being in Kirksville because they hadn't been around blacks very long.
Story_ID: 604665
Speaker 1: You graduate and what are you thinking you're gonna do at that point?
Speaker 2: I knew I was going to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went to graduate school to get a master's [degree].  I wanted to be actually a superintendent of schools.  That was my goal, is to be superintendent of schools.  So, Northeast Missouri or Truman State [Northeast Missouri State Teachers College; Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri] now, had a very, very good master's program and specialist program, which meant that I could transfer to the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri] and get a Ph.D. in educational--higher education administration.  And so I went there in, in--the next year.  See, I was still eligible to run since I had not ran in college for, for, for my freshman year, so I had an extra year of eligibility to run.
Speaker 1: So, did you run during that?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I, I was an assistant coach with Coach Gardner [Kenneth Gardner] and got my master's in educational administration.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now then, what--and so you get your master's.  You graduate first in 1968 and--
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968] and got my master's in--
Speaker 1: Nineteen--
Speaker 2: --sixty--in August of '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: In '69 [1969]. So you got married.  How did you meet your wife, though?  That's--
Speaker 2: She was a year behind--year behind me in school.
Speaker 1: So she was one of those few students--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  She was the--
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: At that time--she's not my wife today--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Bernadine Moore [Bernadine Moore Jackson].
Speaker 1: Okay, great.
Story_ID: 604666
Speaker 1: So you graduate in 1969 [Northeast Missouri State College; Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri].  Now, what are you thinking you're going to do?
Speaker 2: I had been accepted in the Ph.D. program at the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri] and Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri].  Now, this is going to shock you in the sense that that spring that I went up to Washington University, I went up to do all the paperwork, et cetera and so on, and I was walking by the law school [Washington University School of Law, St. Louis, Missouri], and I just decided to go into the law school 'cause I had also taken the LSAT, and Harvey Tettlebaum [Harvey M. Tettlebaum] was the dean, the dean of admissions.  And so I said to him, I said, you know, I was sort of interested in law school, but I've been accepted to your Ph.D. program in educational administration.  And Harvey Tettlebaum still tells the story today, he said, "Well, if you get a law degree, you can still be superintendent of schools."  I said, "Really?"  I said yeah--he said, "Yeah."  He said, "Well, whatever is your score?"  And I said, "I'll send it to you."  I sent him the score and two days later after he got it, he called me.  He said, "I've talked to Dean Lazar [ph.], we'd love for you to come to the law school."  And I talked to my wife [Bernadine Moore Jackson], I said, you know, "I might go to law school," you know.  I said, "That's, that's cool."  I said--and that's basically what it came back.  I had spent the, you know--it was just by accident I went to law school, just by accident.
Story_ID: 604667
Speaker 1: So, now how did you find law school?  This is exciting your mother [Henrietta Green Jackson], right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, because we didn't have a lawyer (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so how did you find the whole experience and, and Wash U [Washington University School of Law, St. Louis, Missouri], just describe where it's located.
Speaker 2: Wash U is in, in, in--
Speaker 1: Washington University.
Speaker 2: --in the City of St. Louis [Missouri] in the City of Clayton, Missouri.  It's--the campus is--part of it's in the city and part of it's in the--in the county.  Law school was a--was a, a great experience.  It was--law school was hard for me, though, very difficult.  I did well, but it was very, very difficult in the sense that coming out of a political science background, you're not really taught to analyze stuff, you're taught to regurgitate stuff.  And so all these years, I was regurgitating things to get a good grade.  In law school, you had to really analyze.  And so my first year was very, very difficult.  I did well, but it was very difficult.  The second and third year, as you know, is no problem, but the first year--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --is just really difficult.
Speaker 1: Well, it's very intense.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Let's just put it that way, a lot of--
Speaker 2: Well, I'll, I'll, I'll do better than say intense.  It was difficult for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, it was difficult 'cause I had to read stuff three and four times to really--
Speaker 1: Understand.
Speaker 2: --to understand it.
Speaker 1: And then briefing cases--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and things like that, yeah.  Now, were there classes that you, you didn't like versus classes you liked?
Speaker 2: I'm still not sure today how I did so well in two courses--or three courses.  First, constitutional law, when I walked out I thought I had failed the course, absolutely failed it, ended up with the second highest grade.  And I'm still not convinced today how I passed commercial papers and I did very well in that.  Now, the course I thought I did extremely well in, I ended up getting a C plus in the course, and that was contracts.  I thought I knew contracts in and out and ended up with a C plus in the course.  But the rest of the courses, I did very well in.
Speaker 1: Now, how many black students were--'cause we're--right now, you're in 19--let me see.  You enter in 1971?
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: And you graduate in 1973.
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 1: So, who, who, who is--who other--I mean, what is the Washington University law school at that point?
Speaker 2: This was the first class that they had more than two blacks in the class.  We had ten blacks in the class in 1970 and that was the height of affirmative action from their perspective, and so they had ten of us.  And of the ten of us, six of us graduated on time.  Two dropped out and two eventually came back.  Well, and I should say, two flunked out the first year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two were on probation and left and came back.  So, six of us ended up graduating.
Speaker 1: How large was the law school, total number of students?
Speaker 2: If I remember right, I think it was about 150.
Speaker 1: That's, that's very small.
Speaker 2: Very small.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you get to know every--
Speaker 2: And that was the largest class they had had.
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.  So you get to know everyone then in many way (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  We had--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I had great relationships with, with our friends at, at Washington University.
Story_ID: 604668
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about your time--
Speaker 2: In law school [Washington University School of Law, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 1: In law--we were talking about law--well, we were talking about law school and I was--
Speaker 2: You asked me if I was aware of what was going on in the city.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in the city.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was very much aware.
Speaker 1: In law school.
Speaker 2: In law school.  See, I've--I have always been very politically oriented very early on because I realize that the only way you could change things in many cases was through politics.  And so I got to know Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] in law school.
Speaker 1: Now, Bill Clay had just--
Speaker 2: Gone to [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 1: Congress in nine--
Speaker 2: In '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968], okay.
Speaker 2: And so when I got there, he was going into his second term.  And I met him on Washington University's campus [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri].  He came to speak to the--to the black students association [Association of Black Students], and--
Speaker 1: You had a black students association?
Speaker 2: Yes, on Washington University's campus.  And so he came to speak to us and he brought a person along who was his top friend and top eight named Leroy Tyus, who really taught me more about politics than anybody I've ever known in my life.  And I told Leroy Tyus, "Mr. Tyus," I said, "I'd like to get to know the congressman."  And he was very standoffish, and he was also the committeeman for the 20th Ward in St. Louis [Missouri].  So, I found out when they had the committee meetings and I went to the committee meetings.  And first, he put me out of the first committee meeting and I came back the next one, and he put me out of the committee meeting.  And then, I came back the next one and he took me back in his office, he said, "Why are you coming to these meetings?  Are you spying?"  I said, "No.  I told you what I wanted.  I wanted to get to know the congressman," I said, "'cause he can be very helpful to us."  And he said, "Well, what do you mean helpful?"  I said, "Well, the black students out on the campus, we might need help."  And I don't know why, but I just really felt that way.  And so eventually, Leroy became my greatest mentor and I got to know Bill Clay very well.  In fact, I used to speak for the congressman after I got out of law school and we got to be very good friends.  And his son [Lacy Clay] and I, who is now Congressman Clay, and I are very close friends.  So, I had a great experience in, in law school.  And in fact, the two students who were on probation only got back in because of Bill Clay and I went to him and said, "It's very difficult."  We need to try to find some way to get him back in.  We couldn't get the two in who had flunked out, but the two that was on probation, we did get back in (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 604669
Speaker 1: Okay, there are several things I want you to describe.  First of all, describe the St. Louis [Missouri] that you found when you got there.
Speaker 2: Unbelievable, unlike the St. Louis today, that is almost dead but coming back.  The St. Louis I went to in 1970 had about seven hundred thousand people in the city, very vibrant, very culturally oriented, just a rich city with a rich history.  I, I have to tell you a story because it's important to tell this story.  My father [Arthur Jackson]--my mother's father was a Pullman car porter and when I went off to school [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], I rode the train from Dallas [Texas] to, to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and we stopped in St. Louis.  And I called my mother [Henrietta Green Jackson] when I stopped in St. Louis.  We had like a three hour stop, layover, and I was walking around.  And you--if you've been to St. Louis, you know where Union Station [St. Louis Union Station, St. Louis, Missouri] is and they got that beautiful fountain that's now back restored outside.  And I looked at it and I called my mom, I said, "Mom," I said, "I'm gonna live in St. Louis," just off the top of my head.  I said, "This is a beautiful city."  Well, I really didn't know it.  I just said it I guess as a eighteen, seventeen, eighteen year old.  But when I got back to St. Louis, went to law school [Washington University School of Law, St. Louis, Missouri] there after going to Truman State [Northeast Missouri State Teachers College; Truman State University, Kirksville, Missouri], it was a vibrant, beautiful city.  My, my ex-wife [Bernadine Moore Jackson] is from St. Louis.  It was just--it was rich.  It had a rich cultural heritage all over, but it had a rich black culture heritage.  I mean, black people were doing things like they were in Philadelphia.  I mean, it was just--Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] was a congressman.  We had a four or five people on the city council [Board of Aldermen].  We had committeemen.  We--I saw where we had relationships with, with whites.  I mean, it was just a vibrant city.  You--it was--it was something that was totally unlike Dallas.  Dallas was segregated.  St. Louis was very integrated.  And so, in my mind, I was just--it was just a wonderful city to be in.  Washington University [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] was a wonderful university because they were going out of their way to get black students on campus and they did almost everything we asked.  There was just--I mean, it was--it was just a wonderful, a wonderful academic environment.  The students, the, the white students on campus were just, just wonderful.  I mean, it was just a--it was--I, I don't know how to describe it other than it was a great three years other than the first year when I had to study very hard, but the last two years was just, just, just a great environment to be in.  And I am--today, Washington University is one of the, the, the top ten or twelve schools in the country.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And I always claim that I'm real smart.  It wasn't there when I was there, but I claim now that I'm real smart because it's, it's a good school.
Story_ID: 604670
Speaker 1: You get politically active more your second and third year of law school [Washington University School of Law, St. Louis, Missouri], I take--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are the--what are--what is forming you?  What are you--what are the issues of the day that you get?  You know, are they local issues?  Are they national issues?  What--you know, because we're talking now about the early '70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, and this is a time of, you know, we're past the death of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Kennedy.  You know, we're with--there's the Vietnam War that is sort of, you know, still present.  There is--but we're also moving.  Blacks are--you know, this is a time when there's a great deal of sort of excitement about possibilities and new opportunities, so--
Speaker 2: I think that really my focus were both, both national and local.  I can tell you that we had some local issues that we were concerned with, but also we were concerned with the war.  And I have to tell you that my nature even back then, even though I considered myself a Democrat, I was very conservative.  I still believe that we should not have left Vietnam.  And, and I say that because of the mass murders that occurred once we left.  I really thought that we could've brought a great deal of freedom to that country.  See, I believe that all human beings want to be free.  So, yeah, that was part of it.  Now, that was one disagreement that I had with Congressman Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.].  He wanted the war over with.  But, I have to give him a great deal of credit.  We disagreed, but he still, still permitted me to learn from him.  We had some local issues that were effective.  We had a mayor at that time named Alfonso Cervantes [Alfonso J. Cervantes] and many of the blacks wanted some people in the high level of his cabinet, and so I was very active with him in that process, trying to work with the congressman to get it done, so much so that I remember one of the professors told me I need to concentrate on my studies.  That was my junior year, and stop spending so much time in the city because he ended up seeing me at a meeting that was on television.  I mean, I wasn't participating, I was just in the crowd when Congressman Clay and, and Fred Weathers [Frederick N. Weathers] and Leroy Tyus were talking about some of the problems that we had.  So, I've always been politically active since I can remember.  I just--I really thought that was the way we get things done.  And that was because of my father [Arthur Jackson].  My father was politically active in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  So, when you come out of a household where your father's active, you're gonna be active.  Well, not necessarily so, but I was.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 604671
Speaker 1: Now, one of the things, I just wanna go back real quickly, too, 'cause I had skipped over it though you did mention it.  Part of that activity, and one of the things you did when you were at Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] was participate on the--you know, on Bloody Sunday.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You had mentioned, you know, you had the--you know, you saw the marks.  Can you describe that day or what, what sticks in your mind about that day?
Speaker 2: We had just left Warren Memorial A.M.E. Church [sic. Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama] that morning and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was in Washington [D.C.] with President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], and Congressman Lewis [HistoryMaker John Lewis] made the decision we were going to march.  And we got to the Pettus Bridge [Edmund Pettus Bridge, Selma, Alabama], and when we got there, we had two people there, Sherriff Jim Clark--and this is when I ask people, if they tell you they've been to the bridge, you can always ask them some questions.  Who is the person who sic'd the dogs, the nightsticks, and came afterwards?  It wasn't Jim Clark.  He wasn't in control that day.  It was the chief of the state troopers [Alabama Department of Public Safety] called Al Lingo [Albert J. Lingo].  I will never forget his name.  I mean, he didn't even--he didn't even speak to us as if we were human beings.  And the N word dripped off his lips like we were his shoes.  And he challenged us tremendously that day.  And he said, if you don't leave-what he was going to do.  And most people do not realize that Congressman John Lewis did not stutter before that day.  He was beaten very badly.  His head was extremely swollen.  And when we said no, they turned the hose loose, the dogs loose on us.  And many of us, about sixty of us were hurt very, very badly, and we all ended up going back to the church and--it's as clear now as it was then.  It was--it was the best of humanity but the worse of humanity that we saw at that point in time.
Speaker 1: Now, why--what was the best of humanity?
Speaker 2: Because all people of faith and color were there and they didn't care.  They didn't care.  One of my closest friends, I don't know if you've ever heard of her, named Viola Liuzzo from Detroit [Michigan], a white lady with two [sic. five] young kids, she was killed on the road between Marion [Alabama] and Selma, Alabama.  And to me, when they attacked us, they didn't care.  I mean, the names that they called the whites, the N lovers, I mean, it was--it was--it was unbelievable.  So, that was the best of humanity because it showed how sick those who were beating us and sic'ing the dogs were.  That was the worst of humanity.  And I'll never forget, I can't think of his name, the priest that was there and a rabbi was there.  I mean, I'll never forget the rabbi's teeth, this side of his teeth were totally knocked out.  I mean, it's something you can't imagine unless you experience it.  So, that in my mind was the best of humanity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, what happened that day more than anything else is it awokened--awakened America to what was going on.  They didn't expect that.  They really did not expect that America would rebel when they saw what they did to us that Sunday and America did.  That's why two weeks later we were able to march.  And I tell people today, they always talk about the speech [I Have a Dream] at the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.] in 1963.  That is not the greatest speech that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] gave.  The greatest speech that Dr. King gave was at the statehouse [Alabama State Capitol] in Montgomery, Alabama, when he said how long?  Not long.  And what was so great about that speech is he started out talking about the American flag that was over to the right side of the building and the Confederate flag hanging on the top of the building.  The American flag was not on the top of the statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama.  It was the Confederate flag.  And that to me was his greatest speech.  I wasn't there in '63 [1963] but I was sure there in '65 [1965] and I got to, to know Dr. King very well.
Story_ID: 604672
Speaker 1: As I said before, one of my--one of my best friends was Bernard Lee.  In fact, his (unclear), Bernard married me.  So, we have been friends for a long time and I, I was at his funeral four years ago when he died of a, a massive heart attack.
Speaker 2: Bernard?
Speaker 1: Bernard Lee.  And there were so many other people around him.  And so I, I can tell you that that day was, was something I'll never forget.  And, and it reassured me that, that there were great people in this country.  And think about that.  That was 1965.  We're in 2007 and I'm sitting here talking to you as the secretary of housing and urban development [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] in the presidential cabinet [of President George Walker Bush].  That shows you how great this country is and how far we've come in such a short period of time and it's all because of people like Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  You know, I've heard people talk about his faults, but all great persons have faults.  It's not what his faults is, it's what he did that's most important.  What did he do?  He changed America.  That march [Selma to Montgomery March], [HistoryMaker] John Lewis, that Sunday [Bloody Sunday].  Had we not followed him that Sunday, I'm not sure we'd be where we are today.  That's why even philosophically, if I don't agree with Congressman Lewis on an issue, I will tell everyone every day.  He is an authentic American hero and we should--we should give him the greatest praise that we can give anybody in this world because this man risked his life that Sunday with that march, standing in front of the line to say, we're not gonna take anymore, so we owe him that.  We owe him the praises.  And I was happy in many ways when I look back that I was there that Sunday because it made me a better person that what I was.  But, I will tell you that after that march, I called my mother [Henrietta Green Jackson] and I told her I didn't think I was coming home.  I said, I just don't think we're gonna get out of here.  I told her that I--the dog had ripped my leg and I--we didn't even have a doctor.  We had a paramedic to, to--I guess the person was a paramedic, I really don't remember, to sew it.  And that's why there's still the jagged edge right down there the way it was sewn in my leg.  Under normal circumstances as young as I was, it should've healed much better, but it--it's healed now, but it's--the scar is very pronounced.  So, I told her, I don't think we're coming home.  I said, "I don't think I'm gonna make it home."  And that day, that day, I'll never forgetting--forget telling, and you might have interviewed this person, Bernard Lafayette, that I'm not afraid to die anymore, I said, "And I'm not gonna be afraid of white people anymore."  I said, "That won't occur."  And that's the way I've lived my life.  But at the same time, I said to, to the rabbi, I said, you know, I, I was just--I was just absolutely crushed to see how they had--what had happened to him in his mouth.  I mean, it was--it was not--it was not fair.  But life itself is not fair, so.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, this--so, you had that happen.  That's in '66 [1966] and--
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965], I'm sorry.
Story_ID: 604673
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-two [1972], you're in law school [Washington University School of Law, St. Louis, Missouri], right, seventy--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, is that forming you?  Like, what are you thinking you're gonna do with the law?  I mean, you were wanting to--what, what, what is the sense of what you want to do?  And, you know, you're meeting Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.], you're meeting, we're gonna talk about [HistoryMaker] Frankie Freeman, [HistoryMaker] Margaret Bush Wilson, what are--you know, who are very actively involved in housing and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I mean, so what are you thinking you want to do?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you exactly what.  I'll never forget, Frankie Freeman spoke to us our senior year in law school, that's how I got to first know her.  And she spoke not only to the black law students, the black medical students, everybody was--probably two hundred of us or so in the room.  And the one thing she said is, "When I started practicing, I had to practice this way.  You all need to think about making money, how you can make money.  Because if you can make some money, you can help people."  And so I had thought about at that point in time being a civil rights lawyer, and I talked to her after that and she said, "Well, how you doing?"  I said, "I've done really well in school."  She says, "Go to a law firm or do something first and make some money."  I'll never forget Frankie telling me that.  And she said, "Then you can help a lot of people."  And that's today what I tell a lot of students, make some money, then you can help somebody.  And so I int- I ended, ended up initially going to the regional counselor's office of the Internal Revenue program--in the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] in the honor's program initially, and then I went to the university [University of Missouri - St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] as assistant to the chancellor [Everett Walters] and professor.  And at that time, actually I was making more money as assistant professor and assistant to the chancellor than I was when I was practicing law.  But I remember distinctly what Frankie said to us, and that was the beginning of our friendship.
Story_ID: 604674
Speaker 1: Can you talk about [HistoryMaker] Frankie Freeman?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I love Frankie Freeman.  I think Frankie Freeman is in the same category almost as [HistoryMaker] John Lewis.  She's an icon.  She was the first black woman or male to serve on the civil rights commission [U.S. Commission on Civil Rights] and she made a great deal of impact.  And I'll never forget when I was her aide, part-time, it was not full-time, and we were in Boston [Massachusetts], and that was during the days of Louise Day Hicks, if you remember her--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and, and I forget the father.  And we were having a hearing on the integration of the Boston Public Schools.
Speaker 1: And that was around busing, too, right?
Speaker 2: That's around busing.  And one of the things that shocked me, see, I've had these milestones in my life, so I'm sitting next to, to Mrs. Freeman, and Louise Day Hicks with the priest during the testimony, and so most people do not realize that East Boston [Boston, Massachusetts] is Italian, South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts] is Irish.  East Boston has never had an Irish priest and South Boston had one Italian priest and he lasted less than a year before they ran him out.  Now, they're all Catholic now.  You have to understand.  So, here's Louise Day Hick--Louise Day Hicks and this priest testifying, and they said to, to them, we would much rather go to school with Negr- they didn't say--with blacks rather than with Dago Jews.  And I said to Miss Freeman, I said, "Did you hear what they said?"  I said, "She said they'd much rather go to school with us than Italians."  And I said, "Did you hear what they called them?"  And they said at that point in time, "If you try to send those Dagos over here, we'll block the tunnel [Ted Williams Tunnel]."  Remember, that's the only way you can get into Boston then from the airport [General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport, Boston, Massachusetts] was the tunnel.  And later on, I learned that there had been one Italian priest in South Boston, never a south--never an Irish priest in East Boston.  Then, I said to myself, I said you know something?  White folks are prejudiced against white folks.  That was the first realization that came to my mind at that point in time, that they would much rather go to school with us than to go to school with Italians.  And I'll never forget the term that they used, and it has stayed with me.  And what I love so much about Mrs. Freeman, she was so cool.  She didn't get riled.  I remember Father Drinan [Robert Drinan].  Father Drinan was just really upset.  He was at Notre Dame [sic. Boston College Law School, Newton Centre, Massachusetts].  And we took a recess after that and Father Drinan was just, just, just unbelievably upset, he and the, the president from San Diego State University [San Diego, California], and Frankie was the calming voice.  She said, "Father," she said, "racism is just racism."  She says, "You can't change it."  And she said, "We just seen it in its biggest form here."  Because Father Drinan was saying, "I can't believe they said that."  Well, it was hard because he was a fair man.  He couldn't believe that, in his mind, these are whites in East Boston that are just Italian, these are whites in South Boston, they're just Irish.  And they, they came to the conclusion that they're--they'll block the tunnel if you try to send somebody over there.  So, but Frankie was the calming voice and I used to sit with her a lot at our house and see the people come to our house, and she was--she was just a phenomenal person.  But I--as I said before, Shelby [Shelby Freeman, Jr.], her husband, was phenomenal because he was my role model in the sense that he had a famous wife but he was so secure and very supportive, and that's why I think that really males should be extremely supportive of their wives, I mean black or white, and so he taught me a great deal about that.  But Frankie was just an icon, just a wonderful person.
Story_ID: 604675
Speaker 1: Now [HistoryMaker] Margaret Bush Wilson, how did you come into her presence?
Speaker 2: I came into her presence because I met her with Justice Thomas [Clarence Thomas] when Justice Thomas came to, to St. Louis [Missouri] to study for the bar.  I was a very great friend of, of, at that time, Attorney General Danforth [John Danforth] who later became Senator Danforth, and he called me and asked me if I would get to know Clarence, and I went over to Margaret Bush's house and met her.  And she is a--she was--I put her, again, with Frankie [HistoryMaker Frankie Freeman], with [HistoryMaker] John Lewis.  She was an icon.  These are--these are people who have had a great deal of influence on my life.  And she was a strong, strong black woman that, that spoke her voice in a manner with, with, with, with, with such--with such dignity.  And, you know, she was heading up the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And when they had their first conference there, I was public safety director [for the City of St. Louis, Missouri], and she asked me if I would make sure that Ben Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] and everyone else got around, and so we became very, very good friends, and we're still very good friends today.  In fact, I just talked to Margaret Bush about a month and a half ago and I talked to Frankie about, about three months ago.  I, I, I periodically just call them to see how they're doing because they've had a great deal of influence on my life and they know it and I tell people every day.
Story_ID: 604676
Speaker 1: So, St. Louis [Missouri] really became a very good place for you in a lot of--yes?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Let, let me say this to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, it's so funny because at my confirmation hearing to be secretary--well, to be deputy secretary and secretary [of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], I think it's very humorous and funny that I had two senators to introduce me.  I had Senator Bond [Christopher Samuel "Kit" Bond] from Missouri and Senator Hutchison [Kay Bailey Hutchison] from Texas.  And I love the way they fight with each other.  Senator Bond said he might have been born in Texas and raised, but he's actually a Missourian.  And Senator Hutchison says, no he is not.  He is a Texan no matter what you say.  So, really my roots are in both places and I call both places home.  St. Louis and Dallas [Texas] are my home.  Dallas was my early upbringing, St. Louis was my nurturing and my midlife, so they have been both my homes.
Story_ID: 604677
Speaker 1: In your last year of law school [Washington University School of Law, St. Louis, Missouri], you said you met, you know, [HistoryMaker] Frankie Freeman.  That was--so you finish law school.  What do you do at that point?  That's what I'm, I'm trying to sort of, you know--what is your first job out of law school?
Speaker 2: In the regional counsel's office of the Internal Revenue Service [IRS].  And I must tell you because that's very important why I didn't last there.  In the spring of 1974, I was basically teaching at--part-time assistant to the chancellor, chancellor.  But before that, we had had a--when I first went to the Internal Revenue Service right out of law school, I started in July.  I think it was either September or October, we had a major storm and I was down in the library all that day doing a research on the case.  When I came out--or when I got up, I had about five messages from my wife [Jackson's first wife, Bernadine Moore Jackson] at that time and I called her and couldn't get a response.  So, immediately, I got in the car and drove home.  Well, in the process of driving home, I realized there were trees all down, wires were down, and we had had a major storm and I didn't even know it.  And I said to myself, unh-uh, I gotta find something else to do.  But I didn't have anything else to do at that point in time.  But, my brother, my oldest brother and Chancellor Walters had been classmates at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  He was chancellor at, at the University of Missouri [University of Missouri - St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri].  And I called my brother because I always call my sister and brother, I said, "I can't do this."  I said, "We just had a major storm."  So, Chancellor Walters had just given a speech.  He said, "Why don't you call my friend, Everett Walters?"  I said, "Okay."  I called him and I said, you know, "I'm really interested in doing something at the university."  I said, "I really want to be a professor," so he brought me on as an assistant professor and assistant to him as chancellor and that's literally how I got there 'cause he and my brother had been in the program at the University of Illinois together.
Speaker 1: Now, how long did--were you in that position there?
Speaker 2: Four years, I think.  Let me--
Speaker 1: Four years.
Story_ID: 604678
Speaker 1: When did you then work with Danforth [John Danforth] then?
Speaker 2: I didn't work with Danforth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was--I was recruited.  I was the first black ever recruited to be assistant attorney general under Danforth, but my ex-wife [Bernadine Moore Jackson] would not move to Jefferson City [Missouri].  And I'm not a believer of commuting.  Okay, I think that's how you lose your marriage is you stay here, she stays there.  I don't believe in that.  So when she didn't, I told Senator--at that time Attorney General Danforth that I couldn't do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's why he called me when Clarence [Clarence Thomas] came in a year later to, to meet Clarence.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: Now, now let me get back, too, so you'll know.  I ran both of his campaigns when he ran for [U.S.] Senate in St. Louis [Missouri].  I was--
Speaker 1: Danforth?
Speaker 2: Danforth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were campaign chair then?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Oh, in St. Louis.
Speaker 2: In St. Louis.
Speaker 1: In St. Louis.  Okay, okay, okay.  So, is that your first introduction--well, no, no, no, that's not right.  You had said--had you--'cause I had read that you were active in both Democratic and Republican circles, so were you sort of--how would you have classified yourself back then?
Speaker 2: The first campaign I ever ran was for a, a guy who was a state representative called Jet Banks [J.B. "Jet" Banks].  We were running against Ray Howard [Raymond Howard] who was a state senator and I agreed to run Jet's campaign.  He didn't think he could win.  I convinced him to run and we won.  And that was the first campaign I ran.  Then, I ran Danforth's campaign.  Then, I helped Bond [Christopher Samuel "Kit" Bond] on his campaign.  So I have been in politics for a long time.
Story_ID: 604679
Speaker 1: So, what did you learn about running campaigns back then?
Speaker 2: I learned that in running campaigns, you really can make a difference.  A lot of times, the candidate is more frightened than the people who are running the campaign, and that was the case with, with, with Representative Jet Banks [J.B. "Jet" Banks].  He didn't believe he could win.  I believed he could win and we did win.  And the same thing, too, with, with Senator Danforth [John Danforth].  Initially, he was running, but I don't think he believed he could win and I kept telling him he could and, and we did.  Now, I only ran the portion in St. Louis, St. Louis County [Missouri], but, but we won statewide three times and I didn't run the last campaign, but the first two I did.
Speaker 1: So, this is nineteen seventy--
Speaker 2: Four [1974].
Speaker 1: --four [1974] to--
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974]--seventy--'76 [1976], I think, was the first time Senator Danforth ran.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But '74 [1974] was when Representative Banks ran.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so in that period, now are you--you know 'cause some people get and they become campaign junkies, I call them, or political junkies.  You know, they--that's what they specialize is running and they're very good at running campaigns.  So, how does the director of public safety, how do you, you know, end up doing that in nineteen seventy--
Speaker 2: Surely by accident.  There was a state senator named James Conway [James F. Conway].  Senator Conway was over at the juvenile justice committee and he asked me if I would be the lead attorney on rewriting the juvenile code for the State of Missouri and I told him I'd be pleased to do it because I was a professor teaching, assistant professor of political science and criminal justice [at the University of Missouri - St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], and so I started out writing the process.  Well, by the time we finished, it was seven lawyers, by the time we finished, he introduced the bill, it was passed.  He was running for mayor of the City of St. Louis [Missouri].  He became mayor and he asked me if I would become public safety director and I said, "Mayor, I don't know anything about fire, emergency medical service, police, housing, anything."  He said, "But you're honest."  And what he means by honest is the last two public safety commissioners before me had gone to prison for taking bribes, et cetera, and so on.  And so I became public safety director.  In fact, I was the youngest public safety director of a major city ever in the history of this country at twenty-nine years old.  And so that's literally how I became public safety director because of the work that I had done with him on that committee.
Speaker 1: Now, he had--the mayor before that had been Poke--Poker?
Speaker 2: Poelker [John Poelker].
Speaker 1: Poelker, okay, and then Conway.  Had that been a--what--had that been a highly contested race at all or not?
Speaker 2: No.  Poelker didn't run.
Speaker 1: Oh, he didn't run.
Speaker 2: He didn't run (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So Conway came in.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 604680
Speaker 1: I wanna also ask just in terms since we, you know, we're with the city council [Board of Aldermen], were Mike Jones [Michael Jones] and Steve Roberts [HistoryMaker Steven Roberts, Sr.], were they all, you know, and [HistoryMaker] Wayman Smith, were they on the city council?
Speaker 2: Yes, all three of them were on the city council with Virvus Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were--they were very, very good council members.  I mean, Wayman Smith is very brilliant.  Mike Jones is very brilliant, although he talks a lot (laughter).  He's my buddy.  I like him a lot.  He's very philosophical, but Wayman was very pragmatic and got a lot done.  I can tell you that sincerely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you--this is all--this is what--it's like a lot of young, sort of Turks.  You know, at this time, you're all in your, you know, twenties--
Speaker 2: Twenties and thirties.
Speaker 1: Twenties and thirties, very active, you know.  What is the St. Louis [Missouri] becoming, though?  You know, that's what I'm just trying to sort of figure out in this, you know, sort of time period.  What, what is it--you know, what is the--what are the demographics, you know?
Speaker 2: The demographics at that time were still about in my mind probably 650,000 people, probably 60-40 or 65-35 [percent] white to blacks, very integrated city.  You had like four wards that were totally integrated.  Then, you had south St. Louis that was probably all white or basically all white.  You had north St. Louis that was basically all black other than for the, the very northern end of it.  So, the city was changing tremendously.  You were having more blacks on the police department, more blacks on the fire department.  It was just--it was a very vibrant city at that point in time.  It was a great place to really live.  It wasn't too big, but it wasn't small.  It had all the, the atmosphere of a big city but yet it was a small city in many ways, and you got to know everyone.  And it was good for me because I had a chance to interact with some of the most political, astute people in this country.  And I will tell you this.  Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] is one of the most politically astute persons I've ever met in my life and I learned a lot from him, as I did from some of the other politicians that were there.  So, it was a--it was just a great place to be at that point in time for me.
Speaker 1: What were you learning from, from, you know, from the politicians?
Speaker 2: How to deal with people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: You, you learn how to deal with people.  And it has been a great lesson to me.  It has helped me tremendously.  What I saw in many cases with Bill Clay is, is that he was charming, at the same time he could cut your throat if you crossed him.  And you have to be tough and compassionate at the same time.  And in many cases, what you find are people are not like that.  So you have--it's, it's almost like a dual personality.
Speaker 1: What about East St. Louis [Illinois]?  What was East St. Louis' role?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just trying to--you know, 'cause there's East St. Louis and there's St. Louis.
Speaker 2: It was a great place to party (laughter).  That's what it was.  They had all the nightclubs over there.  There were great nightclubs but you didn't wanna live there.  You wanted to live in Belleville [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Poor East St. Louis.  It's, it's not even--it's like the wild wild west.  I don't know, you don't--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --hear about it anymore.
Speaker 2: No, you don't.
Story_ID: 604681
Speaker 1: Tell me me what this is--so this puts you up--how many blacks does Conway [James F. Conway] have in his administration?
Speaker 2: Two, myself and the director of the human, human, human rights commission--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who--
Speaker 2: --who is--her family owned the, the St. Louis American, the black newspaper--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the city.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.
Speaker 2: Ellen Sweets.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she and I were in the cabinet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how was that experience then for you?
Speaker 2: Great working for, for, for Mayor Conway.  That was--he was a--he's still living.  He's, he's just a wonderful human being.  The only problem was is he, he shouldn't have been a politician.  He was too nice.  I mean, he didn't have--he didn't have the, the same kind of tenaciousness that Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.] had.  I mean, he was genuinely a nice person.
Speaker 1: So now you work there from 1977--
Speaker 2: To '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: To '81 [1981].
Story_ID: 604682
Speaker 1: And then how does it happen that you become, you know, executive director of the St. Louis Housing Authority?
Speaker 2: Surely by accident.  I have to tell you that when I left public safety, I had applied to Oxford to study for the diplomatic law and I had been accepted and given a fellowship to Lincoln College at Oxford University [University of Oxford, Oxford, England].  That's where I wanted to go.  We had sold our home and I was on my way to Oxford.  I get this call from the mayor who said, "I need you to go over to the housing authority."  I said, "Mayor, I don't know anything about housing, nothing."  He said, "But you're honest." And he said, "I need your help."  He said, "They're going to appoint a guy as executive director, I need you to go be his deputy because he doesn't know anything about housing."  I said, "I don't either."  But the previous executive director had used the maintenance staff to renovate his house during working hours.  So, I ended up, I said, "Well, mayor, if you'll help me go to Oxford, I'll give you two years."  And if you notice, I only spent two years there, never got to Oxford, though.  So, he said, "Yeah, I'll do that."  Well, I went over as deputy and the executive director who was very, very weak, very good human being but very weak lasted all of six months.  And so the mayor said, "I need you to go in and--I need you to take it in as, as interim director."  I said, "Okay, but it's still two years," and I ended up never applying for the job, did not want the job, stayed there two years, and left.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is a new mayor, though, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Mayor--
Speaker 2: Ben Schoemehl [sic. Vincent C. Schoemehl].
Speaker 1: Schoemehl, okay.
Speaker 2: But the only reason he did that is because of Bill Clay [HistoryMaker William Clay, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.
Speaker 2: Bill Clay got him elected--
Speaker 1: I see.  Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he beat Conway [James F. Conway].  And so Bill Clay said, "If you want somebody to get something done, go take to--talk to Alphonso [HistoryMaker Alphonso Jackson]" (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 604683
Speaker 1: So, what did you do between '83 [1983] and '87 [1987], then?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 1: You did that for two years.
Speaker 2: Oh, I ran for office, my first run for office, only run for office, ran for comptroller for the City of St. Louis [Missouri] and lost.
Speaker 1: Okay, that--I was wondering where that fit.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and lost.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was the best thing that ever happened.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it showed you didn't want to be a politician?
Speaker 2: No, because had I won, I probably wouldn't be secretary [of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] today.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I'd have end up still being a Democrat and that's what would've happened (laughter).  Even though I had run Republican campaigns, I probably would've still been a Democrat, so it was the best thing that happened.  And after I lost, I went as a--as a principal with Laventhol and Horwath, and so I was there at Laventhol and Horwath from '84 [1984] to '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Now, what were you doing?  Were you doing political types--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --of things there?
Speaker 2: No, I was doing consulting work with--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with public entities--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --cities, states.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 604684
Speaker 1: How does it happen that you become director of the Department of Public and Assisted Housing [District of Columbia Department of Public and Assisted Housing] in Washington [D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Came by accident.  I get a call from assistant secretary James Bogg [ph.], assistant secretary for public and Indian housing [Office of Public and Indian Housing], who had worked with me when I was at the housing authority [St. Louis Housing Authority], and he said, "I recommended you to Secretary Pierce because we have a serious problem in Washington, D.C.  Will you come up and visit with us?"  I said, "Okay, I'll come up and visit with you."  And let me say this so, so you'll know.  At that time, I was just divorced and it was--it was not a nasty divorce, but I was very much still in love with my wife [Jackson's first wife, Bernadine Moore Jackson] and it--we were both in the city [St. Louis, Missouri] and it was just not good to be here, so it just gave me a real avenue to get out.  Not that I wanted to get out per se, but it presented an opportunity.  So, I went an interviewed with Secretary Pierce.
Speaker 1: Sam Pierce [Samuel R. Pierce, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Sam Pierce, yes, Secretary Sam Pierce, and he said, "I'd like for you to, to really consider taking the job."  I said, "Well, what if Mayor Barry [HistoryMaker Marion Barry] doesn't want me?"  He said, "It doesn't matter."  He said, "I have," I think it was $260 or $270 million he wasn't gonna release unless I was appointed.  He said, "I told him, I'm gonna have a say so in who gets this job."  And so, I said, "Okay."  About two weeks later, Secretary James Bogg called me again and he said, "You need to call the mayor and set up an appointment to go see him," and basically that's what I did and I ended up coming here.  And, but the key to it is is that after about six months, Mayor Barry and I got along very well.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, talk about that.
Speaker 2: I think Marion Barry is a very brilliant man, very brilliant man.  You don't get a master's in biochemistry from the University of Kansas [sic. Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] if you're not brilliant.  But, he, he, he had a very decadent streak in him and that was his downfall.  I think he was a very generous man.  He did a lot for this city and I think that people owe him a great debt of gratitude because he made Washington, D.C., what it is today from a sleepy, segregated town to a vibrant urban area, and everybody else has followed in his footsteps.  No one has duplicated his footsteps.  Had he not been just so decadent, he could've been mayor for life.  But, other than that, he was a wonderful person to work with, very compassionate, very concerned, and I enjoyed working with him for the, the couple of years I worked with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 604685
Speaker 1: First of all, this is your first real experience with housing.  You know, public safety is different from housing.  So, what is--what, what is--what is the D.C. [Washington, D.C.] that you're finding?
Speaker 2: Well, the D.C. that I found, almost like St. Louis [Missouri] when I came, there are no high expectations for public housing residents basically in this country, even today.  People who run housing authorities, the same as the person who ran the one before in St. Louis, D.C., they see public housing resident as people, as human beings with not the--without the same sense of worth that they have and they expect nothing from them.  My perspective is that when I ran St. Louis [St. Louis Housing Authority], when I ran D.C. [District of Columbia Department of Public and Assisted Housing], when I ran Dallas [Dallas Housing Authority], is I believe that all human beings are created in God's image and have the same sense of worth.  Some of us might be wealthier than others, but we're all human beings.  And if we're human beings, there should be high expectations of what you should get from persons.  And so my way of running authorities was not from a paternalistic and patronizing way, but from a way where I expected people to perform, and they did.  See, I believe if you hire--if you--if you demand high expectations, you get high expectations.  And that's why I've been successful in running housing authorities around the country.  That's why D.C. changed, that's why St. Louis changed, that's why Dallas [Texas] today is still the model for this country.  Dallas, Atlanta [Georgia], and Charlotte [North Carolina] are still the model.  And it's important to know that the people who are running those housing authorities was trained by me.  So, it's important to understand that, that it's how you view people and I view people the same as me.  See, what most people don't understand is that there is--there is a parallel experience that everybody has, we're born and we die.  Now, what happens in between is all left up to you.  But if you don't expect greatness from someone, you, you don't get greatness.  And what do I mean by that?  Let's say you have two children.  One of them you tell you're not worth a dime, you're not gonna amount to anything.  The other, you tell you're superior, you're gonna be president of the United States.  What do you think is gonna happen?  The person that you denigrate is probably going to end up being exactly what you say.  The person that you say is superior and going to do well will probably end up doing extremely well.  That's the same parallel that you use when you're dealing with low income people.  Now, notice I don't say poor.  I don't believe people are poor.  Poor is a state of mind, not a condition.  And when I said that, a lot of people get angry.  They say it's a condition.  No, poverty is the condition.  See, I have a lot of wealthy friends with a really poor state of mind and I have friends that are low income that's got a positive mindset.  So, I said there are low income people and if you expect great things from low income people, they'll do it, and, and I've seen it.  I mean, we sent more than four hundred low income students to, to college and 85 percent of them graduated, so it's just about high expectations.
Story_ID: 604686
Speaker 1: Talk a little bit about--at that time when you have the job [director of the District of Columbia Department of Public and Assisted Housing], do you know, do you come away knowing, learning a lot about public housing and, and its history in this country?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--see, most people don't realize how public housing occurred in this country.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about it?
Speaker 2: It occurred right here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. If you go to my office, you can see where it all started.  It was called the alley--the Alley Dwelling Act of 1936 [sic. District of Columbia Alley Dwelling Act of 1934], right there at the Potomac [Potomac River] because you had a lot of people sleeping in tents.  And so Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] made a decision that he had to build housing, but he built the housing for one reason, because he had to put the housing industry back to work, so some of the first public housing was built right here in D.C.  So, it wasn't to really serve low income people, it was to create work for the building industry.  That's how public housing came about.  That's why in many cases you realize, it was not great housing, they just built it temporarily because they didn't expect it to be here for all that period of time.  And so we've had to reduplicate that housing on--in, in major cities around this country because it was intended to be there forever.  So, it wasn't built to really house low income people, it was built to house people who were living in tents.  And that's--and when I say--I shouldn't say low income, they were low income, but the key to it is just to get them off the river.  That's how it started in 1936, right here.
Speaker 1: And then (cough), what would you say have been the important--you know, like up to the point that you came in, you know, 'cause there were sort of some key, you know, key things, you know.  You had the model cities--you know, you had the Model Cities program, you had the--you know, I mean, you know, much as been written about Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] housing, you know, Robert Taylor Homes, Cabrini-Green [Cabrini-Green Homes], you know.
Speaker 2: Let, let me say this to you.  Public housing in its initial state was great because it was transitional.  It was the 1966 Brooke Amendment that changed the (unclear) of public housing in this country.  See, in, in most major cities, public housing was three, four, five years out.  After 1966 when Senator Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke] from Massachusetts said, we should not be housing people that are 60, 70, 80 percent of median and he went down to say that if you're more than 50 percent of median, you shouldn't be in public housing, that began the destabilization of public housing.  That was the generation that created another generation and this generation in public housing.  Because in many cases, many of those persons did not work.  Now, the other part of that process was simply this, that it stopped being a two family household to a single family household.  Most people do not realize that until 1965, public housing, 78 percent of the people who lived in public housing was a man, a woman, and their kids.  By the '70s [1970s], it was a single family parent household, basically women because of the Brooke Amendment.  And so, in my mind, it started the downfall of public housing in this country to what we saw at Robert Taylor Homes and others in Chicago, around the country.  It became crime infested, gang infested because many people began to prey upon those who are less fortunate than we are.
Story_ID: 604687
Speaker 1: Do you have any particular view on the role that the Model Cities part of public housing played?  You know, 'cause that was also in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Model City was a disaster as far as I'm concerned because they did the same thing that basically the Brooke Amendment did in many ways.  They did not integrate people both socially and economically.  They built these models and they put people in there that in the final analysis did not keep the up--did not upkeep those apartments.  And they--in my--I can't tell you they did that intentionally.  I don't think it was done intentionally, but I think it was done callously.  What they should have done back then as we are doing now with the HOPE VI and others is to build models that integrate people both socially and economically.  So, you have one person who might be at 30 percent of median, 50 percent of median, 70 percent of median, 80 percent of median, so they can see people who are succeeding, and that will instill in them the ability to succeed.  That was not necessarily the case with Model City.  Secondly, many of the Model City developments that were built were built very shabbily because the developers made money and they didn't do what they really--what the government really intended them to do, to build something that would last.  And so most of these Model City projects are being--have been demolished today.  In St. Louis [Missouri], if you go to St. Louis and go down Olive Street, we had a huge four hundred complex Model City that's not there today because it didn't last.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that?  Was that the one that was controversial?  Was it--
Speaker 2: Not Pruitt-Igoe [St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Not--but what, what happened with Pruitt-Igoe?
Speaker 2: It was demolished.  But, but, but again (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But why was it demolished--
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1: --in St. Louis?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you why Pruitt-Igoe was demolished.  I can't believe somebody would build a development for people to live in where the elevator did not stop on every floor.  The elevator stopped on every other floor.  And the elevator was not centrally located in the middle of the building.  They were on each end of the building.  So if you had groceries, you had to walk all--in the middle of the building, you had to walk all the way.  It was absolutely unbelievable how they built that building, but that was public housing.  That was Robert Taylor Homes, that was in Chicago [Illinois], I forget the other one that was right there with them.
Speaker 1: There was--there's Cabrini-Green [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois], Robert Taylor--
Speaker 2: Cabrini-Green, Robert Taylor Homes--
Speaker 1: --Homes.
Speaker 2: --and one more.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Stateway Gardens [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Stateway Garden, they were all built that way.  If you notice, the elevators was not conducive to the persons who lived there because they didn't really care.
Story_ID: 604688
Speaker 1: You're here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], do you get recruited to Dallas [Texas] or what?  Or--
Speaker 2: I get recruit--I--yes, I get recruited to Dallas by the mayor of the city who is that--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --who--Annette Strauss [Annette Greenfield Strauss].
Speaker 1: Annette--so you--
Speaker 2: Who was the sister-in-law to, to the Democratic chairman, Robert Strauss [Robert Schwarz Strauss].
Speaker 1: So you are--you're back home.
Speaker 2: I'm back home.  And let me say why I went back home.  I was very pleased to work for, for Mayor Barry [HistoryMaker Marion Barry], but my mother [Henrietta Green Jackson], as I told you, was very, very ill and I, I had been--my sister [Annie Ruth Jackson] and I had been taking care of her.  And when I got recruited to, to Dallas, it was a hefty raise, which I was--which helped me tremendously.  And, plus, it put me in a situation that I could take care of my mother, too.  And so I, I made the decision to go back to Dallas, and my mother died three days before we moved.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you never got back home.
Speaker 2: No, I never got back home.
Speaker 1: Now, talk--
Speaker 2: I got back home, but she was not alive.
Speaker 1: She was not--she was not there.  So, what is the--how does the, the Dallas Housing Authority differ from the D.C. housing authority [District of Columbia Department of Public and Assisted Housing] and its--and the properties, too?
Speaker 2: Dallas Housing Authority was very segregated from the vestige of all those years of segregation.  The Hispanic and white portion was maintained very well, but the black portion was not maintained.  West Dallas [Dallas, Texas], Cedar Springs [Dallas, Texas], were not maintained very well.  We had a executive director who had no respect basically for blacks.  When I got there, the top eight people were all white males in the agency, and that's one of the reasons that Mayor Strauss and Dale Kessler [Dale V. Kessler] who was chairman of the board wanted to change it, and I came in and we had a very integrated group.  But what we did more than anything else is we made sure that public housing in Dallas was integrated both socially, economically, and racially.  Because the best example was Little Mexico [Dallas, Texas].  Little Mexico was Hispanics.  And so when a black applied to go to Little Mexico, it didn't occur.  Or East Dallas [Dallas, Texas], which was predominantly white, when a black or Hispanic applied there, they didn't go.  And so Dale Kessler who was a very wonderful, fair human being and Mayor Strauss said, "We can't continue to do that."  Because Mayor Strauss was the first woman to be mayor and the first Jewish person to be mayor of Dallas, so they recruited me heavily and I ended up going.  And if you notice today, Dallas, Atlanta [Georgia], and Charlotte [North Carolina] are the models for public housing in this country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what were--where did your team come from?
Speaker 2: Basically Dallas.  I recruited almost everyone basically from Dallas.  I'm trying to think, did I bring anyone in--I only brought one person in.  That was my, my executive vice president who was Lori Moon who had been with me in St. Louis [Missouri] and Washington, D.C., and I brought her to Dallas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the only outside person that I hired from--that wasn't from Dallas.
Speaker 1: Now you, you made--well, wait a minute.  Let me just make sure.  You were there from--oh, you stayed there a while, though, too.
Speaker 2: The longest period of time I've stayed on a job 'til now.
Speaker 1: Right 'cause you were there seven--
Speaker 2: From '89 [1989] to--
Speaker 1: To (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighty to--
Speaker 1: Ninety--ninety-six [1996]?
Speaker 2: Ninety-six [1996].
Story_ID: 604689
Speaker 1: Now, there was a court ordered challenge, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, can we talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  We had a major lawsuit in the city [Dallas, Texas] because of the, the, the way my predecessor had ran housing and the court order was to integrate housing, both racially, socially, and economically.  And they were right in the lawsuit.  We had a segregated environment.  And so in the end, if you will talk to Mike Daniel [Michael Daniel] today, he'll tell you that we had our disagreements, but we worked through the process and the lawsuit doesn't exist today because I did work with him.  And we have, today, the most integrated housing authority [Dallas Housing Authority] probably in the country.
Story_ID: 604690
Speaker 1: Can you just talk about that real briefly in terms of integrating the housing?  It's one thing to say it, but it's another to do it.  And how long--did it take your whole tenure to do--to start that process?
Speaker 2: It did.  Actually, we began to see the results about 1993.  That's when we really began to see the results.  It took time to, to do it.  Because there was great resistance in Dallas [Texas] to integrating housing, especially public housing.  You know, that's the NIMBY center, Not in My Back Yard.  You--when we tried to go into communities, they would raise holy ruckus and say, we don't want people here because it's gonna increase the size of our school, gonna increase traffic, the same old NIMBY theories that we have every day.  But we--but we prevailed.
Speaker 1: So, you--now, are you getting integrated back into the community real quickly, right, I mean into Dallas?
Speaker 2: I did very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, that's--
Speaker 2: When I came to Dallas, I was--it was--it was very unique in the sense that I came back as a--as a figure that, that basically had made a name for himself nationally, both as public safety director, housing in each area, ranning--running campaigns, so I didn't come in there as a novice.  And the other thing is, is that to get someone to come back home was a rarity and I ended up coming back home, so that was a plus.  So, I had a very, very good stay in Dallas.  I was treated very well.  I ended up on a number of corporate boards, on a number of civic boards like, like, like the United Way [United Way Worldwide] and the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], the chamber of commerce, the Citizens Council [Dallas Citizens Council].  In fact, I was the second black person after Comer Cottrell [HistoryMaker Comer Joseph Cottrell] who was prolined [ph.] to go on the Citizens Council, which is the ruling body basically for the city.  So, I did very well in Dallas, and--
Story_ID: 604691
Speaker 1: The other thing that happened is I got to know President Bush [President George Walker Bush].  I had met him on the campaign for his father [President George Herbert Walker Bush], but we got to be extremely good friends when I moved back to Dallas [Texas].  In fact, he showed me the community that he lived in and, and in, in fact showed us the house that we ended up moving into and we became extremely good friends.  The--my wife [Jackson's second wife, Marcia Jackson] and the first lady [Laura Bush] are extremely good friends and my youngest daughter [Lesley Jackson], Barbara [Barbara Bush] and Jenna [Jenna Bush Hager] were extremely good friends.  So, it, it, it was very good to me.  In fact, that's why I'm here today.  When the--I served as, as one of the major chairs for President Bush when he ran for governor and as the vice chair when he ran for president.  I was--President Bush appointed me to the, the major commission as chairman of the major commission in Texas, which is the General Service Commission [State Purchasing and General Services Commission], which buys, builds everything for the state.  So, it was--it was a very good opportunity.  The only negative part of the opportunity is, is my mother [Henrietta Green Jackson] died before I got back.
Speaker 2: 'Cause she--if your mother and father [Arthur Jackson] had been able to see it, that would have--
Speaker 1: I think they saw it.  And let me say this to you.  I've had a lot of great experiences, but one of the greatest experiences I had is, is the first State of the Union address.  And when those doors opened and those lights were shining and the speaker said, the president's cabinet and we walked down the aisle, and people are shaking your hand, senators and congress people, and calling your name, I remember looking up and I said, "Mom and dad, I hope you appreciate what you created." That was a sparkling moment and I knew they were with me at that point in time.
Speaker 2: So let me--so, this all happens, what you're talking about is really six years.  I mean, a lot of--not, not your appointment, but--not your appointment here, but that whole thing, you know--well, I won't say--when did--when did President Bush run for--when did he run for governor?  He was--
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-four [1994], I think it was.
Speaker 2: Ninety--yeah, okay, right.  So it was--it was all in this time that you are, you know, with the, the housing authority [Dallas Housing Authority].
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now-
Story_ID: 604692
Speaker 1: You decided to leave public sector and go and seek--you know, have your real first, you know, business, non-public sector job?
Speaker 2: By accident again.  I was on the board of the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] and the chairman of Central and South West Corporation named Dick Brooks [E. Richard Brooks] was the chairman of the metropolitan area, Fort Worth, Dallas [Texas], Boy Scouts, and he was also on the executive board of the national Boy Scouts.  And he was very concerned that we did not have enough blacks and Hispanic Boy Scouts.  So, he asked the executive director, he said, "Who can we get to help us get more black and Hispanic kids in the Boy Scouts?"  So, Earl [ph.] recommended me and I became vice chair for urban scouting.  But what Dick didn't understand and no one understood, they wanted to have three hundred black and Hispanic boys within the next two years.  Well, I ran public housing.  All I had was black and Hispanics.  So, what occurred is within six months, I had like 310 people signed up.  It took them about another four months to get all the uniforms.  So, after I did that, Dick said, "That is just wonderful."  And he called me, he said, "Let's have lunch."  So, I said--I told my wife [Jackson's second wife, Marcia Jackson], I said, "Well, probably he's gonna ask me to go on his board."  And so I had lunch with him and we talked for a few minutes and he says, "What do you expect to do after you leave the housing authority [Dallas Housing Authority]?" I said, "Well, I hadn't thought about that because I don't plan to leave."  He said, "Well, we have a division called Central South West International," and he said, "I really need someone to come in as the vice president to negotiate all of our deals."  I said, "I don't want to be a human rights--I mean, a human resource person."  He said, "No," he said, "I'm talking about negotiating deals around the world." I said, "Well, what does that mean?"  He says, "Just what I said."  And he says, "I think you've got the right skills."  So, I said to him, I said, "Well, let me talk to my wife." And I talked to my wife and she said, "Well, pursue it further and see what."  So, I ended up going back, having an interview a couple of weeks later and after talking, I said, "That sounds great to me." And what I did at that point in time was I said, "What is this job going to pay?"  He never answered the question.  But in the end when I went for the final interview, it was--it was quite a lot and I became a corporate executive, which means you're a principal in the firm.  And so I ended up going there.  And it was easy transition because I really didn't have to know anything about the utility business.  I had to negotiate deals for us.  And as an attorney, it was easy to negotiate deals.  So, I negotiated our deal in India, China, Brazil, England, and around the country.  And after negotiating those deals, a couple of years later, he comes to me and said, "Why don't you become president and chief operating officer of Central South West, Texas," which was our major corporation in Texas.  I said, "I really don't know anything about the regulating side of the business."  He said, "That's no problem."  And so what he did for a week, he got me a tutor, a very--expert in regulatory affairs and for ten hours a day, I stayed with that tutor and learned it and became president and chief operating officer.  And then we merged with EP [American Electric Power (AEP)] and I stayed there until I came here with the president [President George Walker Bush].
Story_ID: 604693
Speaker 1: What do you say you took from that experience, doing that?  'Cause that lasted also for about five years.
Speaker 2: I wasn't ready to go.  I, I enjoyed my job [at Central and South West Corporation].  If the president hadn't asked me to come to Washington [D.C.], I wouldn't have come.  President Bush [President George Walker Bush], as you know, initially appointed now Senator Martinez [Mel Martinez] as secretary [of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], and what he said to me was simply this.  He said--he calls me A.J., he said, "A.J. [HistoryMaker Alphonso Jackson]," he said, "I need someone who knows housing to run it on a day to day basis because the secretary will be doing a lot of traveling."  He said, "I need you to come."  And he had been very good, a very good friend to me and it's very hard to say no to your friend when he's the president of the United States.  And so I said I'd come, and that's literally how I came here because he, he wanted me to come and be deputy secretary, now secretary.
Speaker 1: I know--and so Martinez was here before.  He, he was--
Speaker 2: He was here two year--
Speaker 1: Two years.
Speaker 2: A little over two years.
Speaker 1: And you've been here for--
Speaker 2: From the very beginning.
Speaker 1: From the beginning.
Speaker 2: I came--I was--I was affirm--confirmed as deputy secretary in June of 2001, but I came here in February of 2001.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And then you were confirmed in two thousand and--
Speaker 2: Four [2004] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) four [2004].
Speaker 2: Yeah, in March--April 1st, 2004 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 604694
Speaker 1: Can you talk about your experience here?  And, I mean, it's one thing to run a housing authority, though you understood that helps to have some lay of the land, but how does it--how is it from the top?
Speaker 2: It's, it's, it's very challenging being secretary because when you get up on the tenth floor of this building, something happens to people in this rarefied air.  You begin to think that you're omnipotent.  And if you believe that, you really can't do a good job.  So, I'm a very hands on administrator, although I do not interfere with the assistant secretaries running their respective departments.  I'm very hands on in the sense that I walk the halls, I speak to people, and I visit our field offices and regional offices.  Because those are the people who actually make HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] work.  It's not necessarily the people who sit in this building.  And so I think that it's very important to let people know that you really care about the work that they're doing.  And one thing I say on a consistent basis, I am pleased to be the secretary, but I work with and for the employees in this agency, and I'm only here temporarily.  I'm transient.  When the president [President George Walker Bush] leaves, I have to leave.  But I'll do all my--all my best that I can while I'm here to make sure that the employees realize that they are appreciated, and that's something that has not always been done.  And of the eighty-one field officers, I think I visited about sixty of them.  I visited every regional office.  Because many people had been here thirty, thirty-five years, had never seen a secretary or deputy secretary, so I think it's, it's, it's more of a morale booster for everyone.  My job is to be the cheerleader.  There are two things that a secretary really does, he carries the message of the president and he's a cheerleader for, for the agency because you travel a great deal.  And that's why I said that when I was deputy secretary, I ran the agency on a day to day basis.  So, it--I've had both experience running the agency and being the secretary.  And so it's a--it, it was--it's a very enlightening experience.
Speaker 1: It's big.
Speaker 2: I don't like--I don't like necessarily dealing with [U.S.] Congress, but--because they do a lot of micromanaging.  If I had my druthers, I mean, it's not that I disrespect any of the congressmen or senators, but their staff try to micromanage and many of the staffs are very young people and they really have not had any experience.  So, I think that other than those challenges there, everything else has been very wonderful.
Story_ID: 604695
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, because we're in the area of hou- you know, housing, it's a area you grew up in.  We had not talked about the voucher program, which was one major initiative under the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan]--you know, that got--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --started under the Reagan administration and has been implemented.  You mentioned HOPE VI.  There's also a program--is HOPE VI part of HOME [HOME Investment Partnerships Program] or is HOME totally separate?
Speaker 2: HOME is different.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I want you to talk about, because I think, you know, one, the war has eclipsed a lot of things, so I think in the--you know, in the whole major things, people are not necessarily thinking housing.  I mean, you--in Chicago [Illinois], we know that lots of housing is being built, period.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: You know, so--and there are other urban areas around the country, lots of--you know, there's a lot of housing being built.  What is the position, what is attempting to being done, you know, in the field, you know--what are HUD's [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] top priorities right now?
Speaker 2: Our top priority right now is this.  We have a serious problem with subprime lending today.  We have major legislation over in the [U.S.] Congress called Federal Housing Administration modernization.  Last--in the month of June, we had 175,000 foreclosures.  We think we're gonna have somewhere between 175 and 200,000 in--when the figures are calculated for the month of July.  Had we had the legislation passed by now, by June, we could've saved ninety thousand of those houses from going into foreclosure.  If we had had it passed by July, we could've saved probably 70 percent of those houses from going in foreclosure.  So, that is a major priority now for us.  Secondly, I think it's very important to understand that there are only three agencies that have not been cut under President Bush's [President George Walker Bush] budget, homeland security [U.S. Department of Homeland Security], defense [U.S. Department of Defense] and housing.  He is a very committed person to housing.  And I'll show you how committed he is, that in August of two thou- two--August of 2002, in Atlanta [Georgia], he made an announcement that he wanted to create 5.5 million new minority home owners by 2010, and he emphasized the home owners that he was talking about was black and Hispanics.  As of today, we created five--3.5 million new black and Hispanic home owners in this country, and I'm convinced that we're going to get to the 5.5 million before 2010.  But, not only did he make that commitment, he funded the program.  When we walked in here, we were having ten thousand--$10 million a year for, for housing counseling; today, we have 50 million.  We didn't have a down payment closing cost program; today, we have one to help up to ten thousand dollars down payment and closing costs.  He's created the home program that did not exist, which helps states build low and moderate income housing.  He's, he's enriched the shop program, which is basically Enterprise Foundation [Enterprise Community Partners] and Habitat for Humanity to, to over $100 million a year to help build houses.  So, he is a very committed president to housing and that's why I'm so pleased to be working with him.  Because right now, we have more resources than HUD has ever had to help people get into a home, but at the same time, we also have more resources to help people who are in public or assisted housing or the Section 8 voucher program.
Story_ID: 604696
Speaker 1: Secretary Jackson [HistoryMaker Alphonso Jackson], what is your vision, though, for public housing?  And, you know, we, we talked--you talked some about what, you know, how it began, that it was really more for the builders, you know.  There's a perception, you know, that in, in the public's mind sometimes that it's a necessary evil, but what, what is--what would you like to see it become?  You know, you even have talked about, you know, in Dallas [Texas], Charlotte [North Carolina], and one other place, that those are the best run--you know, run, run places.  I'm just trying to--
Speaker 2: I think public housing or assisted housing or voucher programs should be integrated both socially and economically.  You should have a stratum, not just--it shouldn't be 90 percent of the people, 30 percent low median.  You should have 30 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent.  See, I believe that when people see people doing well, it makes them do well.  But if you concentrate poverty where everyone is in poverty, they have no incentive to change their style of living or to change their way of living, and that's what we've seen in public housing in this country, and I don't think we can build that kind of public housing anymore.  And if--where it does exist, we should begin to renovate and change it.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Story_ID: 604697
Speaker 1: 9/11 [September 11, 2001] had--that was a, a--you know, you were very involved in, in 9/11.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: So--because that was the largest single grant that has been given, 700 million [dollars], right?
Speaker 2: To New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, to New York City.  Is there anything else that you would like to talk--can we talk about HOPE VI?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think HOPE VI is--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I, I hadn't read--I had read about HOME [HOME Investment Partnerships Program].
Speaker 2: Well, HOPE VI is a wonderful program.  In fact, I gave HOPE its name.  It's called Housing Opportunity for People Everywhere.  We have extended almost $5 billion on the HOPE VI program.  But, the problem today with the HOPE VI program is that of the almost three hundred grants that we've given out, we've only had sixty-one one of them successful in the last twelve years.  So, to date, we still have $2 billion outstanding.  That's why I, I have asked the president [President George Walker Bush] not to fund the, the HOPE VI program until we spend that money.
Speaker 1: So, can you--what is HOPE VI, though?
Speaker 2: HOPE VI is the, the development of public housing that is integrated again both socially and economically.  You don't have one stratum, you have three or four stratums of people living.  And the other thing that we try to do with HOPE VI is to make sure that when we develop it, it is--it has a commercial portion to it, too.
Speaker 1: And what is HOME, then?
Speaker 2: HOME basically helps the state.  It's funded directly to the states.  And what it does basically is gives the state money to give to develops--to developers to write down the ability to, to build homes that are affordable.  Best example is, let's say that a home might under, under necessary circumstances might cost $150,000, but the state picks a developer, which they have to give RFPs, requests for proposals, and they evaluate those proposals and they said, okay, we'll give you $100 million to do this, and they write down the, the, the loans so the house rather than being 150 might end up being one hundred thousand dollars.
Story_ID: 604698
Speaker 1: Sometimes you're known as, you know, sort of an outspoken, you know--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --critic or outspoken.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, you know, my mom [Henrietta Green Jackson] said something that I've never forgotten.  She says, there are two kind of human beings.  She says there is one that people describe, they say, "Well what do you think about Alphonso [HistoryMaker Alphonso Jackson]?"  "Well, he's a nice guy, but."  Then there's another person, "What do you think about Alphonso Jackson?"  "He's extremely outspoken and says what he thinks when he thinks it."  And my mother said, "It's better to be the latter person so people will know where you are and you don't keep animosity and hate in your heart."  So, when I discipline somebody or I say what I say, it's over with for me.  I don't have any, any--anything else to say about it.  And I don't hold grudges.  That's probably why I--why I sleep well at night and that's probably why I can get up at 5:30 in the morning and exercise.  'Cause once I tell you what I want or tell you what I think, I'm not angry with you anymore, and that's something that most people don't do in this country.  They hold grudges and--you know, my mother said something that I've never forgotten.  She said, "It is the hater who suffers, not the person that is hated."  And so I don't want to carry any animosity around with me.  So, yes, I am extremely outspoken and it gets me in trouble a lot, too, you know, but, you know, you only have one life to live and I think you should live it and be fully pleased with the way you live it.  If you don't, you're the one that's gonna suffer.
Story_ID: 604699
Speaker 1: So, you know, you seem very youthful even at sixty.  You know, we were talking off camera that, you don't, you know, don't--you know, you don't look your age.  What, what haven't you done that you would like to do, you think?
Speaker 2: You know, that's a very excellent question.  I will tell you that I set goals very early in my life.  I fulfilled almost everything that I've set out to do.  If God takes me tomorrow, I have no regrets at all.  I am--I've, I've lived a very full life.  I'm not ready to go.  That's why I exercise and eat well.  But I don't have any regrets of anything that I've done.  I am--I had a very full life and I think very few people can, can really say that.  The only thing I'd love to see is, is, first, my oldest daughter to have me two more grandbabies, I only got one, and for my youngest daughter to get married and have me three grandbabies.  That's probably the only thing I really want at this point in time 'cause I want to be able to spoil them.  I just bought my grandbaby a pair of golf clubs 'cause next year we're going golfing 'cause she'll be four, so she can play golf.  So, I don't want her to have the same bad golfing habits I have.  So, I'd love to have two more and then I'd love for my youngest, Lesley, to get married soon and give me three more.  I'm not gonna ask them for more than three, but that's what I'd like to have.
Speaker 1: Now, your children, can you give their names?
Speaker 2: Annette Watkins [Annette Jackson Watkins] and she's thirty-seven, and Lesley Jackson and she's twenty-seven.  And they're wonderful kids.  One is the senior vice president at JPMorgan Chase [JPMorgan Chase and Co.] and the other is an attorney with, with a major law firm.
Story_ID: 604700
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: That we really get our act together.  It is very devastating to me that today all these years after the Brown versus Board of Education decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] that we have kids coming into this country from Africa or from, from China, from India who are doing better academically than our black kids are doing in school.  That disturbs me tremendously.  I just believe that at--when you have 70 percent of black babies born out of wedlock, that is not a good thing because you perpetuate poverty.  When I was coming up in the cities, 60 percent, 70 percent of us were born into two family families, so I have real serious problems with that.  Secondly, I think what's important to do today is this, we need to tell our kids that they can succeed academically, not athletically only, and that has been a serious problem.  Because we keep telling kids, the only way we can do is you gotta be a Michael Jordan, you've gotta be a Tiger Woods.  What we should be telling kids is you gotta be a Ben Carson [HistoryMaker Dr. Benjamin Carson, Sr.].  And if we tell more kids to be a Ben Carson, we'll get more doctors, more teachers, more lawyers, and everything else.  And so my contention is this, and I close with this, when I speak to black kids, I never tell them what they can't do, I tell them what they can do.  And I tell them don't let racism stand in the way.  My father [Arthur Jackson] taught me something that I remember today.  He said, "There are two ways you can view racism.  You can view racism as a wall too high to get over, too deep to get under, too wide to get around.  At that moment, you become a victim.  Or you can view racism as a hurdle that you must jump from birth to death, and if you hit a hurdle, try to land on your back because if you can look up, you can get up," and that's what I tell black youth.

Speaker 1: One last question.  What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That he tried to do his very best to change the quality of life for low and moderate income people in this country.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was great.
Speaker 2: Okay, I appreciate it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Thank you.
