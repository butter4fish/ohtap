 Baeza The following interview is being conducted with Mr. Adrian Saenz for the Latino Americans: 500 Years of History grant project at Oklahoma State University. The interview will become part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the Edmon Low Library on the Stillwater campus of Oklahoma State University. The interview is taking place on Friday, July 14, 2016, at the Edmon Low Library in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The interviewer is Victor Dominguez Baeza, director of Library Graduate Services. Hello and thank you for agreeing to participate in this oral history project, Mr. Saenz.  Saenz Thank you for having me.  Baeza I want to remind you that this interview may be published as part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater Oklahoma, and that you have granted us permission to publish the transcript and video, in part or in its entirety. Okay, so first off, can you give me a little biographical information about yourself, so your name, where you were born, that kind of stuff.  Saenz My name is Adrian Alonso Saenz. Adrian was originally given to me because my mom really liked the name. Alonso was given to me in honor of my grandfather, and Saenz came from my father. I was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. There   s a funny little joke in the sense that whenever I was born, my brothers and sisters joke around that immediately after I was born, my mom went back to work. That   s how things were back then, but (Laughs) since then, I   ve traveled through a variety of different schools. My parents actually came from Julimes, Chihuahua. My dad was originally the first to cross the border. After he got kicked out of his home at the age of thirteen, he then came to the US, spent some time here, made some money, and then went back and collected my mom, and then came back over here. By that time, my two older siblings, actually my four older siblings, they were all born in Mexico.  5  Whenever the transition over here came, they had to apply for citizenship. On the bright side, they all already have it now. Me and my youngest sister, Vicky, which I   m the baby, so she   s like the youngest of the four sisters, we were born here, so we had a lot more benefits. We started like, what is it, mid-town Oklahoma City. From there, we went to Gatewood, then we transferred to the south, went to Jefferson for a couple years in middle school, and then we finished up our last middle school and high school in Dove Science Academy Oklahoma City. That   s really where I am from, a nice combination of the two. It   s not a bad place to grow up in Oklahoma City, but I   m definitely excited towards expanding out, and then eventually coming back to Oklahoma.  Baeza You mentioned one of your names came from your grandfather, Alfonso?  Saenz Alonso.  Baeza Alonso, so tell me something about your grandfather.  Saenz I know very little on my grandfather. Within Hispanic culture, they have the masculine identity, so from what I know, my family was a little bit more close to my grandma. My grandfather, on the other hand, had a bad reputation, and he would fight with my dad, and he would go, and he would drink. He kicked my dad out at the age of thirteen, so I know very little about him. I know that whenever I was born, my dad made it a note to necessarily give me that name in honor of him. It   s still a little bit of a mystery.  Baeza Where did you say your parents were from?  Saenz Julimes, Chihuahua.  Baeza When did they come to United States?  Saenz The exact numbers escape me, but for me, growing up in the US, I never really prioritize knowing whenever my parents came over. What really mattered to me was the fact that they came over, and I have these experiences, and these privileges that not everybody else has. I don   t really like to think too much about the past.  Baeza What was your father   s name, or what is your father   s name?  Saenz Nicolas Alonso Saenz.  Baeza And your mother?  6  Saenz Her name originally was Eduwiges Pando. Eduwiges, whenever you pronounce it in English, Eduwiges, is hard, so she actually got her name changes, and she is now Vicky Pando.  Baeza Do you know how they met?  Saenz They grew up together. I know they told me about one of their dates. From my understanding is my dad went, and then he came back, and he was more in the city, and he really wanted to impress my mom. He rented out these two horses, and at the time, they went out horseback riding. Actually, it was one horse. They rented one horse, and they went out horseback riding, and where would now be the baseball stadium of the nice little town, and whenever he would ride it, my mom   well, she knew how to ride horses, so she was all peaceful because she knew my dad didn   t know. Whenever my dad decided to let her switch, she booked it  The joke is that by the time they finished riding, my dad had lost about almost everything that he had on, with the exception of his clothes, so his wallet, his watch, his hat. It was all gone, and it   s hilarious.  Baeza (Laughs) That   s funny. Where were you born again?  Saenz In Oklahoma City.  Baeza And what year was this?  Saenz This was in May 24, 1993, so the year of the rooster according to the zodiac calendar.  Baeza What was it like growing up there?  Saenz It was peaceful. I never really retained a lot of my baby memories. Like my sisters, for whatever reason, they can necessarily remember all these things. I used to have the world   s biggest teddy bear, and I would never let it go. I used to be a chunky baby, and they used to nickname me the Michelin Man because I was so chunky. I only really remember things because they rub it in my face. Besides that, it   s one of those things within your mind that if you don   t really use it, you lose it. I imagine it was peaceful. I don   t have any traumas or anything, so it was a good childhood. I can   t remember it. (Laughter)  Baeza What   s your earliest memory?  Saenz That one would have to be around the time of my   well, kindergarten actually. Reason being, it was the first day of class, and I didn   t want to go to the class. There   s some stuff that went down in pre-k that I am not too proud of, but I remember my mom taking me to class. It was Mr. Ford   s 7  kindergarten class, and I was scared, and I was latched onto my mom. Next thing you know, the professor   not the professor. The teacher recognizes this and takes out this massive bucket of plastic dinosaurs. I walk, and I get distracted by the dinosaurs. Next thing you know, I turn around, Mom has already booked it down the hall. I   m crying my heart out, and she   s gone. They brought out yet another bucket of dinosaurs, and then I was okay. (Laughs)  It was interesting, they tell me. This is another one of the memories. I never really went to   . It   s pre-k that comes before kindergarten, pre-k? I went one day, and this is what they tell me, but for whatever reason, whenever we went to recess, there was these two girls that were following me. I didn   t like it, so I went to the sandbox and got some sand in my pocket. Then the girls came over, and then I ran away. I went up to the top of the slide, and they kept following me, except this time I was waiting. Whenever they made it to the top, I got the sand out of my pockets, threw it in their face, and then slid down. Then afterwards, I ran to my mom, and I told her I never wanted to go to pre-k again, and I never did. I don   t remember that. I don   t even think that even happened, but that   s what they tell me.  Baeza Did you have any brothers?  Saenz Yes. Actually, the way that it worked out, it was   . I   m the youngest of six. We have the first four, then there   s a nice little gap between the first four and the last two. It started off with my sister, Alma, then my sister, Dianna, then my sister, Mayra, then my brother, Alex. Eight and a half years later, my sister, Vicky, and then me, so there   s a nice little decade, in terms of time, between my brother and me. It   s pretty interesting.  Baeza You mentioned before that when your family moved here that they had to apply to become citizens. Do you know anything about the process they went through?  Saenz I know my mom was the first, not necessarily a ton. I know that it consisted of an avocation, of a fee, of waiting, a test, passing the test, and then the ceremony. It   s been pretty consistent. I imagine that it   s changed, in terms of the waiting time, since now and then, because back then it wasn   t too much of a big priority to allow people to get citizenship. For the most part, it was pretty standard, but then again, this is coming from a kid who doesn   t remember. (Laughs)  Baeza When you were growing up, do you remember, was your family involved in the Hispanic community in Oklahoma City?  Saenz I don   t think so. They were involved, we knew people. Okay, we   ll go back, because it all revolves around my mother. My mother has always been a 8  smart cookie. She had always wanted to be her self-employed. She was the oldest of  ten . There is one or two that died, but she still had to take care of everybody else, so she had always been working since the longest time. Whenever it came down that she moved to the US, she was looking towards how can she contribute to the household. There   s this pretty interesting story of how she became a realtor. Originally, she really wanted to become a realtor because she liked the idea of going, interacting with people and selling them houses. My dad, going back to that masculinity idea, would not let her become self-employed.  She got her license, and then she went to go work for a nice little company. It turns out that back then, you would make three percent commission off of a house, you would keep one point five, and the company would keep the other half. She was smart about this, and she knew this, so she strategically planned around this. Whenever she sold her first house, she got a nice little check. I don   t know what it translates to back then, but she got a nice little check, and instead of putting it and saving it away, she got it cashed and immediately went to a country and western store. She bought two pairs of boots, two pairs of pants, two belts, a couple shirts, a couple hats. She had this all strategically placed in their bedroom for whenever my dad came home. She got it all taken care of, she bought it, she put it there, and she waited.  Eventually my dad came home, and then he was tired, but my mom was like,    Hey, I sold my first house today, and I bought you something. Go check it out in the room.    He goes and he sees all the things that were the rave back then, and he   s super excited. Then this is where my mom was very, very smart. She   s like,    Do you like them?    He said,    Yes, I love it        I want you to know that if I was my own company, I could have bought you twice this amount.    My dad thinking on the moment, is like,    Oh, what are you thinking about? Go get your license  Go get it done,    and that   s really where it took off. My mom then got everything taken care of, started her own firm. She then moved onto taxes, to accounting, to insurance, to Herbalife. She   s done a variety of things. She   s a little entrepreneur, but within those interactions, all her clients   .  She   s met a variety of different people within the Hispanic community in Oklahoma, so they all come. I have a little bit of fame because of my mom, because like,    Oh, look is this your son?       Yes,    like,    I remember whenever you were this high, and you had diapers, and you were so cute. Look at you now, I don   t know what happened.    I   m just like   . (Laughs) They really enjoyed that aspect. People know me because of my mom, because I was younger growing up because her office was in the house, and then she eventually moved over to a nice little office apartment. It   s been interesting, so through her work, she   s been involved with the community in 9  terms of helping people get necessary loans for houses, getting things taken care of, understanding the system.  As a strong advocate within other regions   so let   s say within the Hispanic community we have church, church is big within our community. I don   t really   . I was baptized, but I haven   t done my first communion nor my confirmation. It   s because she always devoted so much time towards working, she didn   t really get a chance to necessarily be there, or take me to church, or things like that. I think my sister   s a little bit different, mostly because she completed all that things whenever she went to a private university, but it was that trade off. She always had to work, and because of that, we weren   t going to church. We weren   t interacting, we weren   t meeting all these different families.  Baeza What about your father? You mentioned he got kicked out of the house, so is that why he came to the US?  Saenz Yes, so I don   t really understand the idea of why he got kicked out. Somethings you don   t want to remember, but he did come to the US. He started working within the roofing, the asphalt   not the asphalt, is it the asphalt on the roofs?  Baeza Tar.  Saenz Tar, there we go, so he started working through that. It was sun-up to sun-down. The only thing about my dad is that he   s very malleable, so whenever his friends would tell him things, and they   re having a couple of refreshments, they had it so that   . He was very impressionable, and there   s some interesting stories, in the sense that he used to have this mechanic that would always take advantage of him. He would take his car to get fixed. The mechanic would fix it, but then he would put a cap inside of one of the pistons, and that way his car would mess up, and he would come again. He would do it again and again, without really knowing. Another instance of that is whenever they would get together, my dad   s friends would talk bad about my older sister, Alma, and he would treat her bad. There   s a little bit of family problems in that mix, but it   s because he really cared what others thought, so that really affected the family.  Baeza When you were growing up, was there an emphasis in education?  Saenz From my mother, she bribed me. For her, education was key, so we had a deal like,    For every A you brought me, I   ll give you five dollars.    For me, getting As was a bonus, because within a quarter of the year, I could walk away with forty bucks, so I always strived to get As. It   s interesting because whenever I was younger, and I did not necessarily understand the concepts of money, like my elementary school years, I got anywhere between the 10  ranges of Cs to As. My middle school years, they   re mostly As and a couple Bs. Then my high school years, there were nothing but As, except for one B in Spanish, and it   s pretty ironic.  Baeza I think that   s typical.  Saenz Well, it   s an interesting story. She has definitely prioritized grades, and because of that, I was able to get a couple scholarships for being top of my class, and then having a good GPA. It even made my acceptance to OSU a whole lot simpler.  Baeza Did she do the same thing with your brothers and sisters?  Saenz Yes, not maybe a ton, in terms of offering them five dollars for every A. Back then things were harder, but they all understood the importance of education. They were all really good at math and at writing, and it   s like we come from a family that we   re smart. We branched out into different areas, but we never really struggled a ton with education, mostly because my mom set that strong belief that education was key. We always did our best to learn and get it done.  Baeza When did you first start thinking about coming to OSU, or how did you first hear about OSU?  Saenz It goes back to about junior, senior year. There was talk about college my freshman and sophomore year because the school itself wanted to prepare us for college, but there wasn   t a ton because we   re ninth, tenth graders. We still didn   t know who we were. We were trying to make friends and survive, not make teachers mad, so we had this nice little bubble. Whenever it came to junior and senior year, that bubble now encompassed what came after high school. Originally, I never really did sports, and my sister always did sports, to the point that my brothers would try to peer pressure me into doing sports. I eventually decided to try sports, and I got involved with basketball, and then that really was what consumed my time. On the bright side, I also had a friend, whose name was Jorge Garcia. He had heard about this program because he was more college-oriented, he had more connections.  He was the first one to establish communication with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) here on campus. They had sent him this application about this event, and he literally went from the library to the gym, pulled me out of practice, took me to apply. I applied just to make him happy, and then I went back to practice, right, not really knowing about what came ahead. It turns out that my application was accepted, and I was welcomed to campus on this event, called Welcome Weekend, hosted by the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. That year it was me, George, Cesar, and another friend of ours, called Moises. We came, they 11  housed us on campus. We had a lot more interaction within the students rather than with faculty, and all these people that they are the PR. They   re paid to do PR. We had more the student touch, and we met more people, who were interested in similar math and science, or the basis of it, introducing us to engineering.  It was an awesome weekend, it was amazing. That was the first cool experience, and then later on that year, I was salutatorian of the class. We were taking one of those computer classes that enables us to necessarily explore different resources, and apply, and this and all these   they   re trying to get you to branch out, long story short. Within that one, the teacher had asked me and the valedictorian what are we going to do with our lives, and where are you going, that way that can motivate the other people to get their lives together, which is fine  It was like,    Okay, give me a weekend,    and like boom. I started contemplating what I was going to do for rest of my life right after that question. I knew that I wanted to go to OSU, it made sense. My family, my brothers and sisters, they really liked OU, so going to OSU added a little bit of fuel to that fire. At the same time, I had visited campus, it was nice, it was open.  It was far enough away, but still pretty close, so it made sense. I now had to find a reason, like an academic reason, to go there. I started searching, I knew I was good at math and science, so I did what any person would do. I did a Google search, and engineering popped up, and it had a list of all the different types of engineers, and from there, I started reading. It described mechanical engineers, working with mechanical parts, like,    No, that   s not me,    aerospace, working with planes,    No,    and the list went on and on. I even covered civil, which is pretty ironic because that   s what I am now, but it wasn   t until I came across environmental engineering that I knew I wanted to do engineering. For me, the description read dealing with a variety of different laws and things like that, but the part that really mattered to me were three words that were like,    environmental disaster relief,    right? I thought,    Oh my God, that   s going to be awesome     At that time, it was pretty recent.  It was 2009, so there was some things happening in the Gulf around this time in history, where BP had spilled a ton of oil into the Gulf, and there was major repercussions. Then there was this famous commercial that came out by the Dawn company, where they were taking steps to clean animals. From that commercial, I remember specifically, them cleaning a penguin with Dawn soap. There was this nice, white technician, they were cleaning this penguin, and then from there, I thought to myself,    If that   s environmental disaster relief, I can really imagine myself doing that for the rest of my life, even though there   s a chance that penguins might bite.    From there, I searched for schools who had environmental engineering. There was a couple random schools towards the edges of the state. 12  I forget what they are, but I found that OSU had an environmental option underneath the civil engineering track, so I was like,    Okay, that   s perfect. Boom, environmental, environmental, they are the same word. They must be the same thing.    I made my decision then, and from my junior year, I knew I was coming to OSU. Senior year came around, I applied to all these different universities because we had to for another class. Once I got my acceptance letter from Oklahoma State, it was done, it was set, I knew, boom. I had sealed the deal right there, so I was ready.  Baeza You mentioned that because of doing well in school, how it helped a lot with your financial, so what kind of scholarships or awards did you get?  Saenz I got, because I was resident of Oklahoma, and my parents didn   t make too much, I got Oklahoma   s Promise, which that one has helped a lot throughout the years. The Academic Excellence Scholarship, which gave me  2,500 each semester   not each semester, each year for four years, so that was amazing. Then there was a variety of smaller ones. My freshman year, I got this  1,000 scholarship from the engineering foundation, and then a variety of small ones, but because I had the good grades to back it up, it wasn   t hard. I didn   t have to wait for forever to hear back. Opportunities came in by themselves, so all I really had to do was accept.  Baeza You mentioned that your friend pulled you out of practice to apply for the program here. Can you tell me more about what you learned in that two weeks about the program?  Saenz It was on a weekend, so it was two days, but what it consisted of was we came to campus, and we got introductions from the different staff and the students who were help putting it on. We played the world   s greatest game of Mafia. I don   t know if you ever played it, but it   s amazing. Then it was really in the bulk of Saturday that things really took off. They had Maria Diaz, from the, what is it, office of financial aid, she was there. They had one of the recruitment, what is it, not advisors. I forget what they   re called, but the recruiter from my area, and they were talking to us from admissions, and then they had, combined with those two talks, a variety of different engineering-based games, so we made a parachute. We worked on little assembly lines.  They were little games that were modeled after those specific types of engineering, so that we can see what we like, what we didn   t like, what kind of areas we were looking forward to. We had a ton of fun, so we had a little bit of sports Saturday afternoon, and we had lunches, and dinners, and breakfasts together. There was a lot of one-to-one interactions, opportunities to share stories, back and forth. It   s pretty crazy because I actually went to the program two times. One my junior and one my senior, and they had 13  similar talks, but different games and different people there. In one of those, I met Jessenia, she comes into play later, within my college years. I didn   t know at the time, that the relationships that I was making at that weekend impacted my entire five-year experience here at OSU.  Baeza As you were mentioning Jessenia, so are there people that you went through that program with, the two years that you actually went to school during your time here with?  Saenz Jorge, the one that originally pulled me in, he took a little bit of different track. He first went to community college, and then came over here, but we   re in school together now, and he had arrived two years ago. For my last two years and then this year, he   s been there, and he   s finishing up as well. Jessenia, which at the time, she was interested in engineering, so we both started off in engineering whenever I came into OSU, in the fall of 2011. Although her path has taken a different route, in terms of her major, she is still involved within the Hispanic community, and I still see her around often.  Then we have Jose Bocanegra, which he was one of the students who was actually, what is it, putting forth the event, he was organizing it. Then I came in, and there was a couple years that we got a chance to interact with. Then we even have Cassandra Cortez, which she also volunteered at the time, then became future president. She was my role model to go up to, and then it went from there. There   s a variety of different networks. It was really a nice little web of support that helped me in different ways that I didn   t really foresee in the future.  Baeza What was the name of that program?  Saenz It was Welcome Weekend, and it was hosted by the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.  Baeza Do you know how long that group has been on campus?  Saenz It   s actually pretty funny. They   re two years older than I am, and I am currently twenty-three, so they   ve been here for twenty-five years now. I believe, from looking them up through campus life, they submitted their application for organization in October 29,1991, so they   ve been here a while. It   s definitely been an organization that   s had a roller coaster, in terms of attendance and different leaders that are taking it forward. It has a lot of definitely interesting concepts, but they have been here for twenty-five years now, which is astonishing.  Baeza What did you do with them during your time here?  14  Saenz That really goes into   . I started off with my involvement in high school, so I attended their events. Then whenever I came to OSU in the fall of 2011, they were actually the first organization that I sought out to go join because I really enjoyed the weekend. That was my connection to it all, so I went there, and for that first year, I was actually the freshman of the year member for the organization. I went to a lot of their events, socials, community service, and we were working towards Welcome Weekend again. I assisted within small portions of that, but I was moderately freshed.  By my sophomore year, I had applied to be historian, and I got it. There was some change in the structure of the execs, and I got promoted to secretary. By a semester   s time, there is yet another set of changes, and I got promoted to VP, and that was my sophomore year. By my junior year, I was president, I held that office for two years. By my senior year, I was StuCo representative for a semester, but then things really topped off, in terms of finishing my career, so I really had to let go of that responsibility. About four years and a half of involvement, so it   s pretty interesting. All the way through the food ladder, from member all the way to president.  Baeza What   s the focus or mission of the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers?  Saenz Overall, as a national organization, they really want to promote more Hispanics within the field of STEM. Specifically, more towards engineering, but they really want to have more Hispanics in the STEM fields and STEM professionals. That   s one side. Another side is that they really want to help provide the resources in order for those students to be successful. They really want to be the counselor and the mentor to help people get there, but at the same time, for the members who already in it, they also want to be the role models for people to follow and look after. It   s a nice two-sided path objective, but they really want to promote Hispanics within these fields that are so needed and they   re so sought after. There   s a ton of possibilities within it, so that   s national. Depending on the different chapters throughout the different regions   . There is eight regions throughout the US. We currently fall, here in OSU, within region five, we are called the    Wolf-pack.     We   re actually one of the bigger regions, mostly because we have Texas, but it varies a little bit between chapter to chapter. Originally, within my freshman year, we had a little bit more social focus, but whenever I started going into the leadership roles within it, I really enjoyed outreach. For us, outreach became a big priority, and then from there, we also added a little bit of conferences because we wanted to get that national exposure and we wanted to travel, so it made sense. Then whenever it became that curve, and I was stepping off of the leadership platform, they were focusing a lot more towards socials and inner-member connections throughout different chapters 15  in the state. There is a chapter in the University of Tulsa, but it had died out, but they came back. There   s a stronger chapter in the University of Oklahoma, so we definitely try to do events with them to unite us, in terms of different universities. There   s a little bit of rivalry here and there, a little bit of smart talk, but overall, I think in terms as an organization and a set of students, we definitely want to help others be as successful if not more successful than who we are.  Baeza What kind of programs does the society do on campus for students that are here already or for high school students?  Saenz Okay, it   s been a little bit of a learning curve throughout the years. I know that for my freshman year, we tried to do Welcome Weekend again. We had failed because we didn   t put too much emphasis in PR, so we actually didn   t get any applications. We had everything ready to go, so that was a little bit of a bummer. Whenever we worked on it sophomore year, we had a small attendance, we had seven students, but it was awesome. Whenever we worked on it for the third year, we had fifteen students, so we were making progress. However, on the fourth year that we worked on it, there were some changes within how you can house the students, and it wasn   t possible to have them anymore on campus. The event itself disappeared a little bit because of regulations and liabilities within the university-wide. That was one of the bigger ones that is tied to me, but then we have Noche de Ciencias, which translates into Nights of Science.  Being that we have nice representatives from Dove Science Academy Oklahoma City and Dove Science Academy Tulsa, we used our connections to host these science nights    learnings. It   s a two-part event, where it   s welcome to both parents and to students. There   s a nice little introduction, there   s food, of course, and then they split off to where the parents are learning about financial aid. They have the chance to talk with a financial aid consultant because a lot of the time, they don   t know necessarily what to expect, or how to pay for it, what are some of these terminologies. We focus within that area within the parents, but on the student side, we organize these different events/little competition teams. They have a set where they will be building a boat to withstand these two challenges, building a parachute to safely transport this pod, or building a spaghetti tower to   .  These variety of different games that really gets students thinking about some of the challenges and how to solve these challenges, but on the same time, interacting with each other, working as a team, really working together as engineers would do. We really push that forward, and then we bring in a whole ton of positivity, and connections, and resources for the students, which is pretty fun and amazing. If ever one of our other sister organizations have one of these events, we   d send down volunteers to assist with whatever they may need, and then we have different socials. We   ve gone to go watch 16  movies, we   ve gone to study together, we   ve gone to go do the escape game in Tulsa with another chapter. We   ve had socials here and things that unite us. We also, in my third year at OSU, we did a service regional outing. It was a giant social/sports competition, but for the entire region, so we had a ton of people come. It was awesome.  We played sports, we had food, we did a little bit of dancing, get our groove on, and then we did some community service on Sunday. It was a nice social Saturday, and service on Sunday, and then people split ways. We have the hotel accommodations ready for that as well. Then we participate within the Juntos Tutoring Program in Tulsa, where we would send a couple of our students to go help them with their math homework on one Saturday in a month. If the students really don   t have any homework, then we start talking about our college experiences, trying to give them a little bit more foresight, in terms of the future. It   s a nice learning experience/mentoring opportunities there, and then we have these conferences, which in the past, we used to split and go to two different ones. One was HENAC, which stands for the Hispanic Engineering National Achievement Award Conference. It   s a mouthful, but we would go, it   s usually held in like New Orleans.  We went down there, send a couple students, we got introduced to this concept of the College Bowl, which is recruiting but on more soft skills basis, and it was fun and amazing. Then we also went to our national conference, which is the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers National Conference. I   ve been to the one in Detroit. Last year, they went to Baltimore, and then this year, I think it   s in California. I think it   s in Long Beach, but you   d have to check on that one. We send people that way, and that one   s pretty cool because you   re seeing SHPE in its entirety. Whenever I went to Detroit, we actually broke a world record for the largest Hispanic gathering at a conference in the US, so it   s like,    Boom  Add that to my resume.    There   s some pretty amazing things, and it covers a variety of different aspects. It really depends on if we   re meeting our national goal, to mentor and to help students be successful, and depending on what the chapter wants to focus on. They can really go anywhere.  Baeza Where does a lot of the funding for SHPE come from?  Saenz It   s actually pretty amazing, in the sense that it varies from chapter to chapter. There   s these different pamphlets that they can help you with for you to ask sponsorship from companies. Being that we   re in Oklahoma State, or at least within my times as president and as VP, I found that there   s a lot of resources and a lot of different funding opportunities within the university itself. Whether it be through Campus Life, the Office of Multicultural Affairs, the VP of Student Affairs, even our college as well, they   re doing a lot of funding towards different events. It   s a matter of 17  asking, and getting the right paperwork done, and submitting an application on time. For the first couple of years, we actually got all of our events funded through the university.  Then there was a little bit of fundraising that we did ourselves. Another benefit that OSU has is its relations, and it   s working within POSSE, which is like our link to the sports world, and Express Professional Staffing, which takes up their job-parking requirements for the football and basketball games. They staff people, and they have a nice little thing where they   ll bring on an organization. You have to submit a team of five to a basketball game or a football game. You donate your time, in terms of helping direct traffic and standing at the gates, and preventing people who can   t park there from parking there. It   s actually paid really well, and one semester alone, we were able to rack in  2,500, which we can then distribute into our different events, so that we   re making money as well, and putting it forward.  Then these other different resources are seeing our efforts, and they   re matching us that way we can get the full one-hundred percent that we have. Then it also helps that the university has a foundation account that   s dedicated towards   . At least in the past, it was dedicated towards specific organizations. There   s a little bit of change to make it now towards the college itself, for a ton of organizations can ask for help like that. The biggest reason for that is that should an organization perish, that organization is the only one who can extract the money from the foundation. No other organization or staff could, so by putting it into a general account, we can make sure that the money that   s being donated is being used to help future students. There   s a ton of support, a ton of opportunities, some amazing alumni that really put it all together, and bundle it, and make it amazing.  Baeza How important was SHPE to your graduation, to you getting through OSU?  Saenz It was definitely critical. To start off from my freshman year, my first week at OSU was actually quite horrible. I didn   t get the benefit of the luck to have any of my friends from my graduating class of forty-five to come to OSU. I was really the only one. My family was a mile and fifteen   an hour and fifteen minutes away, so I really didn   t have them. I didn   t get the luck of the draw of getting a fantastic roommate that would invite me places. I got one that was like,    Peace, I   m out. I   m going to go hang out with my friends,    and he would disappear. For my first week, it was actually quite lonely and actually quite depressing, and there was a void, but because of that void, whenever I saw the pamphlet, I decided to go. SHPE was really the starting point from it all. From there, again, if we think back to Jessenia, who I had met at one of the events whenever I was in high school, I met her there again for the first meeting of my first year for the society.  18  From there, she told me about the Hispanic Student Association, that they   re having this event, had no idea what that was, but she invited me, and that introduced me to HSA. From HSA, I then branched off into Student Support Services, OK-LSAMP  Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation , what would then become Sigma Lambda Beta, and then even more community service, and different involvements with different staff. It has helped me throughout the years, mentoring programs and from there, it keeps expanding like a little web, but it all started because of SHPE. In terms of a leadership standpoint, SHPE actually comprises a nice bulk of my leadership experience, mostly because my freshman year, it was still going okay, but there was changes that were happening. People were tired, and they didn   t want to do it anymore, so the organization itself, say we started with twelve people my freshman year. By my sophomore year, there was only six of us, and that was pretty much just the executives.  That was a little bit of a bummer, but from then, we were able to come back. Now the organization stands anywhere between twenty to thirty, which is pretty good, because it   s that curve. There   s now more people who want to do these officer positions because they appreciate what they can do within the society. It   s a nice little conduit so that students themselves can impact different portions of their communities, and I   ve learned that throughout it, with the different priority and community outreach events, they   re my favorite. I enjoy the bejesus out of them, but from there, more people got inspired and things like that. Now that I was on my way out last year, then I was reminded of how critical my role was within the organization to inspire other people to want to do it, which was a side, that whenever I was going through it, I never really imagined.  To me, I was trying to do something that I had a passion for, and from that passion, it inspired others to have passion. It   s a nice opportunity there, and then you can   t forget the amazing sense of travelling the world. Travelling within the US, whether it be to Louisiana or to Detroit, there was some interesting road trips. Made some amazing, long lasting relationships, and then from there, I got a chance to see different portions of the US. Especially coming from Oklahoma, where it   s huddled in the center, and we   re just plains. It   s flat, there   s not a lot of dynamics happening there. It   s interesting to see how things are going throughout the different parts of the US, and interacting with different people from different areas. It builds on my travelling skills and my international perspective.  Baeza When you first arrived, you had talked about how that first week was lonely, (Laughs) and then you started   . Jessenia got you involved with the Hispanic Student Association, so what was the Hispanic population like when you first got to OSU, that first year?  19  Saenz What   s pretty interesting is that my freshman year, I was actually part of a diversity floor. I lived on ninth floor Kerr, and to me, it was a regular dorm. I came to find out that it was a diversity floor about a year and a half later like,    Oh, hey. Did you know we lived in a diversity floor,    and we   re like,    What?    We never really knew, so I really think that that really encompasses, in my opinion, the presence of Hispanics at OSU. There were Hispanics present, but you didn   t know, or there wasn   t a strong community present. You could find yourself living on a diversity floor, not knowing that it was a diversity floor, or living within a community of Hispanics, not necessarily recognizing that it was a community.  There was a need for bridges to be made amongst us, so that we can continue our culture and share our common ideas. At the time, my freshman year, it was just   . HSA, which was the biggest Hispanic organization, had merely twenty to thirty members, and that was including the officers, so we   re really only talking about twenty. It   s interesting to know because that   s the biggest, so you can only imagine with the other different organizations, that they were small populations. There was hardly any diversity because with small numbers, you can only do so much.  Baeza Then by your senior year?  Saenz Oh, by my senior year   now, HSA stands anywhere between sixty to seventy members attending a meeting, so that can mean that they have sixty to eighty members throughout the year. Now, we   it   s still the largest, but it multiplied by four. SHPE now is twenty to thirty, so now they   re more visible. Now there   s that greater sense. Now, if you   re searching for such community in diversity, you can find representatives just about anywhere. Where in the past, you really had to search for them. Now, you can just start talking to people, more people would know about the Hispanic community, about HSA, about what they do, mostly because us Hispanics love to talk. Still, it serves a purpose in the sense that you have an easier access to find these students, and become involved, and do some pretty amazing things. It   s definitely been a good change. It   s a nice little exponential curve, but it   s curving up, so it   s fantastic to have that.  Baeza Are there different people on campus who had an influence?  Saenz There were. We have a variety of different staff members and different mentors. The first one that came, really almost immediately, was whenever I went to HSA, I met their, what would be advisor, Brenda Morales. She was so welcoming that for my entire first year, I didn   t go to my dorm, where I didn   t have a good roommate. I went to her office and relaxed, and other people would come in, and those were the days. I got a chance to hang out, and we talked about different organizations, talked about life, talked about events. Brenda was really a nice motivational force that really pushed me 20  onto more programs versus organizations, which came in crucial towards the later parts of my years because I focused more on research. Brenda was the one that first told me about research because I was like,    No, what is research? Who even talks about this?    It wasn   t exposed to me, but then she introduced me to some people. Next thing you know, I   m doing research for my master   s now, so it   s a pretty interesting change of events.  With my interaction with Brenda, I then became involved with Student Support Services, where I met Justin Morris. He   s my advisor, my personal advisor. We talk about life, we talk about my problems, about my grades, about my goals, and it   s nice to have that to remind yourself to keep pushing forward. In the beginning, it was crucial because he helped take my three point two GPA, and he set it towards the right. That was amazing, and then he has helped me with challenges that I didn   t know who to talk to, so it was pretty amazing. From there, again Brenda introduced me to Marcia, I think her name is now Marcia Todd. I think she got married. Yes, she is married. With that, I was involved with the Inclusion Leadership Program, and that helped me get experience with talking about diversity, about inclusion, about what we stand for in general.  Even then, I got experience in hosting a bigger conference that came amazingly well whenever I did Welcome Weekend for my junior year, so that was my sophomore year. From there, it was through a variety of people that I met Dr. Sara Mata, which at the time, she was Sara Mata. She hadn   t got her doctorate yet, but she was my go-to-girl for my junior year. She was an advisor for SHPE, I was the president, and whenever I wanted to talk about and get her feedback on certain things, I would go to her office. That relationship helped out so much for that year. I suppose she was in girl problems, because that   s whenever I had my longest relationship and all those things, so it was definitely a learning experience there. From there, going back to my sophomore year, I also met Kay and Farrah, which introduced me, Kay Porter and Farrah Williams, to the realm of research.  Helped get me within REUs  Research Experiences for Undergraduates  and research experiences over the summer time, go to Colorado, go to DC, go to Texas, all these amazing different places to talk about math and science is amazing, and there has been so many. Then we have Dr. Jorge Atiles, which was my freshman mentor, which there was three students assigned to him. One never bothered to show up, one showed up for the first day and never came back, but I was the only one who has kept it up. To this day, I still go visit him. We still talk about life, he tells me about his family, I tell him about how I   m doing. He   s concerned about my health, which is amazing, because it   s a good reminder. Although people don   t necessarily like to be reminded about their health, it   s a good reminder to have. He   s definitely been crucial there, and then the list goes on and on.  21  Baeza During your time at OSU, have you mentored others?  Saenz I have, especially towards my later years, so my senior and super-senior year. Once I had different experiences there, I was more well-known. I had a good reputation, good grades, good career, good morals, good character. People came and they asked me for advice. We would talk about life, we would talk about differences in opinions. I also have two mentees. One was during my junior year, I had Ivan Martinez, he   s a business communication major. I got a chance to talk to him about life, here and there, then my senior year, I got Jonathan Nathan. He   s an African American student studying architecture, so we were able to talk about different struggles because engineering is hard. I know that we shouldn   t complain because there   s a light at the end of the tunnel, but man, sometimes it sucks.  Being able to be there for Jonathan, whenever he wants to vent, is crucial. It   s interesting. Although now my roles are on a more personal basis, I lead through character and integrity, and other people recognize that. They have told me like,    Oh, I look up to you because of what you stand for.    Starting if off, I did those because that   s who I was, but by me being who I am, I can now help others be who they are. That   s a butterfly effect that you can   t really calculate they expected outcomes, but it   s a good feeling to have. It   s all been because I   ve had good coaches, who have made me a good coach, and now it   s a cycle that continues.  Baeza You mentioned earlier that a year and a half after you   d lived in a diversity floor, that you found out you were living on a diversity floor. Can you explain what a diversity floor is?  Saenz A diversity floor ties into the idea of living learning communities. Living learning communities are special communities within ResLife that students can opt for to better their experiences. For example, you have within people interested in the Honors College, you have Stout Hall, which is an entire dorm dedicated to students who are in the Honors College. You surround yourself with people who are like you, who have your similar goals. Engineering specifically now has two entire dorms. There is one floor that   s special for engineers, who are also women. I think they   what is that, I forget the little acronym that they have it, I think it   s MACH  Maude   s  Squad or something like that. You find yourselves in these communities of students, who are like you, who often have your same classes, who have your same values, and a lot of the times, have your same struggles.  You find yourself interacting with different individuals, learning about them, about their struggles, and at the same time expressing yours, and you build together as a little miniature community within a massive community. Within the diversity floor, we didn   t know it was a diversity floor, but we did have Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, Caucasians. We 22  had everything, and we would all commandeer towards the nice little lounge, and from there, we learned about different challenges that different ethnicities or races face. We talked about it, we went through this harsh reality of college together, and for our freshman year, you   re still trying encompass it all in, so we were there for one another. It was pretty amazing.  Baeza You mentioned the program   what you wanted to study when you first came to OSU, environmental   .  Saenz Civil engineering with environmental option.  Baeza Where did you finish at?  Saenz I finished my civil engineering with environmental option this last May. I got everything taken care of. It was amazing, walking across that stage was awesome. The only challenge that came with it is that I learned later on that this environmental option field wasn   t necessarily about saving penguins, but rather about designing water and waste water treatment plants, the infrastructure associated with them, and the ideas behind them. Working with the microbial community, towards making sure there   s enough hydraulic retention times. There   s a little bit of water hydrology encompassed in it, that   s really where it was focused on, so it   s pretty funny. My last semester I took this course called air pollution. In there, towards the later portion of the course, they brought in one of the better air pollution engineering firms    representative. He pretty much told it to me (told it to the class, but specifically to me) straight was that environmental engineers have two jobs.  They   re the guys who help the government make the regulations to calm people down and prevent massive pollution, but on the flip side, they   re the guys that help the companies pollute, to the maximum extent of the law, our environment. For me, that was a conflict of interest because I don   t want to help people pollute the environment. I want to save the environment, so with that, although I finished my civil engineering degree, I consider myself as competent as any of my classmates. If I really wanted to, it would be a pretty competitive competition for a job, but the truth is, I don   t want to go into the consulting world. I want to go into the non-profit world, I want to do something amazing, whether it be through research or through service, that would save our environment.  Knowing that, instead of pursuing a master   s in civil engineering, I switched over to a master   s in biosystems and agricultural engineering because they have a little bit more focus towards stream restoration, water properties, and things like that. Concepts that I can learn, and take with me to a different part of the world or even the states, and look at their water quality aspects, and help clean it for the environment, not necessarily for people. If I clean it 23  in the environment, I   ll clean it for the people, so it   s two birds with one stone, but still. I have that heart and that passion for the environment, and society is included within the environment. It   s not just human   s; it   s everything else in between.  Baeza You   ve started your master   s program, so what are your plans for the future?  Saenz My plans right now are divided into five options. We have one being a research opportunity. There is the Fulbright program, which the Fulbright is a travel abroad experience that has really two avenues. One   s to teach English abroad, but the other one, that   s more relatable to me is one is to conduct research with a different host institution for a year. Six to ten months would be amazing, so that   s that potential avenue. They have different connections within South America, so I   m thinking central Mexico, Ecuador, or even Argentina. Argentina is my last one. I   m thinking about those three states   oh, not states, countries. I would really like to go learn about that. It   s actually really interesting because if you think about Brazil and the Amazon, that   s a crucial river for the entirety of South America, not just Brazil. Within some of thing things that has happened within the past year, I forget the name of the company, but they dumped in a ton of arsenic and mercury into the waters.  That has potential effects for vast ecosystems for the future. I want to know what they   re doing, and I want to know how I can help, so that if something like that were to happen elsewhere, then we can learn from what happened in Brazil, and apply it and prevent it somewhere else. I think a similar case has happened in Colorado as well. Long story short, there   s opportunities to learn about man-made disasters, because we   re all human, we   re bound to make disasters. Instead of focusing on the negatives, we can in turn focus on the positives, so that   s why the Fulbright is so amazing to me, because of that possibility. Then we have really two service opportunities, which would be the AmeriCorps, which would keep me within the states, but in a different city, or the Peace Corps, which I can then go into South America.  Be doing simple things, not that are too knowledge-intensive like the Fulbright, but still, they   re essential to help a community function, and survive, and to contribute. We have those two, and then the last two, which I haven   t found them quite yet, but I designate these spots for two companies, who do conservation work. The interesting part about conservation is if you   re a true, diehard conservationist, you   re probably not going to make a ton of money. That   s the reality, and then the only time that companies that make a lot of money care about conservation, is either if they   re getting fined like crazy for something they did, or it somehow impacted their future standings. I really want to find a nice little company that   s in the middle, that worries about the big companies, to bring in at least a little bit of 24  money, but at the same time, worries about the big pictures. It   s a matter of searching for what that company may be.  Baeza Sounds interesting.  Saenz Then there   s always that last tangent. I don   t know if you   ve seen the videos about these different critical thinkers, that devise something that they can use to better the environment. For example, in South America, there   s this man who works with plastics. He takes a lot of trash plastics, he molds them down into a more concentrated form, and he makes these little Lego bricks, and he makes houses for the poor based off of the plastic. There is a ton of plastic problem, he made houses because there was a homeless problem, he connected one-on-one together. There is this other brain child that was interested in fluid dynamics, but was also interested in the trash in the oceans. He created this giant net in the center of the ocean   well, they   re going to build a prototype, and they are going to test it.  He created this giant net that characterizes the waves of the ocean, and causes the waves themselves to bring the trash over. This net brings it around, and it eventually picks it up, so it   s a little dumping station for an ocean that would get rid of the trash. There   s these Australian   . I don   t know what they are, but they   re Australian engineers or students, who had the bright idea of creating this little portable station that you can put in docks. Water flows in, trash flows in, but because of a pump, the water flows out, and the trash remains. These different ideas that people have that better our environment, so that   s the tangent possibilities because I don   t know if I can make any money off of that.  Baeza Are you planning on staying associated with OSU?  Saenz Of course  I   m working my way to becoming a lifetime member. I really enjoy the opportunity to   . The option is that while you   re a student, you can choose to become a lifetime member, which if you do it after you graduate, it   s a thousand bucks, but if you do it whenever you   re in school it   s six hundred, and you pay seventy-five dollars a semester. Right now, I   m at I think four hundred dollars, still have to finish the remainder. It   s like I   m working towards it, and the biggest reason that is is I didn   t become an alumni member to get free t-shirts, or to get these little promo things or whatever. I became an alumni member because majority of the money that I contributed would go in towards scholarships. For me, scholarships were the key to my success because I didn   t have to worry about finances, I just had to worry about my classes.  For me, if I had the opportunity to make it rich and create this amazing scholar   s program   . For example, if I won the lottery, I can pay off all my debts, fine. I can choose to invest in this crazy house or this crazy car, or I 25  can choose to create this nice little scholar   s program that can help other students be successful. To me, other people, whenever they went through it in the past had that same option, and they chose to donate back towards the school. That   s what helped me, so I want to continue that sense of community, and that sense of passion for OSU in the future. I just have to get rich first.  Baeza It   s like that pay it forward. What was the most important or meaningful event or experience in your life so far?  Saenz Oh, boy. There   s so many. It   s hard to really sum it up, so I   m going to pick one, right off of the top of my head. About two years ago, they had   it   s actually really funny. My sophomore year   . Let me add background. There   s this program called the   . Rather, it   s a scholarship pageant. It originally started as the Miss Hispanic/Latina Oklahoma State University scholarship. For the past, what would be sixteen years ago, it   s been offered for women. They compete, and they   re based off a character, charm, these soft skills. If they win, they get to represent their community, and do some pretty amazing things. For them, it   s been going well. It   s been increasing every year, and it has a good reputation, and it keeps getting better and better. My sophomore year, they had talked about the possibilities of making the first ever Mr., but there wasn   t enough interest. They actually asked me my sophomore year if I was interested in competing in this pageant.  I said,    No, that   s dumb. I   m never going to do it.    Little did I know given two years, my experiences had changed my perspective and I actually competed my senior year because I had one more year, and I won. I was the first ever Mr. Hispanic/Latino Oklahoma State University. That was pretty awesome, in the sense that the year that came after, they did the first Mr. Asian, and there was also Mr. Black. By first of all changing the stereotypes that pageants aren   t just for girls, it   s still   academic-wise, there   s still opportunity that you as a person can grow, and pay for your school. At the same time, we impacted other different minority groups, which that was amazing because that   s what we want to do. We want to live an impactful life. On the flip side, the fact that it was a Mr. Hispanic, it   s nice to know that with the creation of the Mr., the once ideas of the whole masculine society within Hispanic community, guys don   t compete in pageants.  Now that that opportunities there, we can stray away from that view towards a more tolerant, opportunistic view. That was pretty amazing. I   m not going to lie, I got a lot of jokes from my sisters and brother. They had so many jokes, so many, but it was pretty amazing. It was definitely life-changing, I can say I competed in a pageant, which not a lot of guys can say they did that, unless it   s Mr. Universe or something like that. Still, I became the first ever Mr. Hispanic. Now there   s new opportunities for other guys. You have to help change those mindsets, but that   s truly something that happens 26  whenever you have passion and you dedicate yourself towards other things. You start going away from the things of the past to the things of the new, and that can really benefit communities, neighborhoods, societies, cities, towns, etc.  Baeza What did you do during your year as Mr. Hispanic?  Saenz Definitely community outreach, I did a science night, where I went to the local middle school, and I worked with all the sixth and the seventh graders. We worked with magnets, with balloons, with rainbows. They were super excited. It was amazing. The energy and the vibes, it can really do wonders. I would go   . I would still be involved with SHPE, so I would still do the Noche de Ciencias. I actually got the chance to design the game, which for that year was Don   t Sink My Battleship, which was pretty interesting. I helped plan it there, and then I was always involved. HSA, whether it be community service or a fundraiser, I was there. Whether it be through SHPE fundraising an event, or even getting things and the paperworks, and helping the new president, and things like that, I was there. Throughout my entire reign, I maintained what I was already doing. I added in a new responsibility, but it all fit in within my organizational bubble. I will say that these days, I get a little bit more sleep, but it   s a sacrifice that   s worth making.  Baeza On a similar line, what was the happiest moment?  Saenz That one is hard too. There   s been so many. It   s hard to isolate the happiest. Whenever I went Greek, that was an amazing   . I felt so accomplished. Whenever I became president ,and we got a chance to go to these different parts, or whenever we did the SRO  Scientific Researchers Organization , and I got special recognition, that was amazing. I would have to say though, the happiest moment by a majority of a landslide is having people, who you might have never focused your attention on. They   re lower classmen, so you didn   t really have enough time to pay attention to it, but people, who you barely know come up to you, and say,    That because of the things that you chose to do, you changed my life. Thank you.    That appreciation for being who you are, that   s amazing. I would have to say that one.  Baeza Is there something, since you   ve been involved with the different programs on campus during your time here, is there something you   d like to say to current or future Hispanic students here at OSU?  Saenz I would have to say it all boils down to character, integrity, and energy. No matter what you   re representing, what you   re aiming to do, or what you   re trying to do, whether it be through an organization or through your classes, or through whatever. Energy, character, and integrity are the biggest ones. Character and integrity because you have to know who you are, and what 27  you want to accomplish, and how you want to do it. If you want to be that student that wants to scrape by, that   s fine, but you   re going to have so much more work to make up for it in the future. If you want to be the student, who is getting everything together, doing even more on top of what   s required, you   re going to have some pretty amazing experiences. Within everything that you do, you definitely have to bring the energy because we live in a black, and a gray, and a white world, where most of it is gray. You have your Debbie-downers, you have your optimistics. You being one of the optimistics, you have to bring the energy so that you can sway the people who are neutral and in that gray zone to the white zone, so that you can overcome the black.  Does that make sense? You have to put in the forth the energy to make sure everything   s planned and that the events happen. As the events are happening, there   s that energy, that positivity, and the good memories that are also occurring, so that the things that you start and that you work on get continued throughout the variety of different years. I learned that through Welcome Weekend, through Noche de Ciencias, through community service, through Greek life. I   ve always been happy. I   ve always been excited, even about these silly little jokes that are called dad jokes. I love dad jokes, but that   s just who I   ve become and that makes my days brighter, but at the same time, although my friends don   t like to admit that they like my jokes, I   m pretty sure that they laugh inside. Whether it be laughing with me, or laughing at the fact that I   m so excited or so happy about a joke like that, it brightens their day. It makes the world that we live in that much better.  Baeza Is there anything that I didn   t ask you about that you   d like to talk about for the interview?  Saenz I think one of the things that I find that is on the rise, there   s a little bit of work that needs to get done within it, but I find it really interesting within the concept of multicultural Greek organizations. I definitely admire the fact that within these days, there   s more options. There   s more of my friends considering to go Greek, and to build that community in a once predominantly white community. I really appreciate where that   s going. There   s a little bit of tweaks here and there, there   s competition, rivalry that makes it hard. I think all in all, OSU is definitely going from a traditionally white fraternities and sororities to more diversity, whether it be NPHC  National Panhellenic Council  or MGC  Multicultural Greek Council . There   s more minority groups that are also opening up the world for Greek life for minority students.  Baeza You mentioned joining a Greek group. What group was this?  28  Saenz I joined Sigma Lambda Beta Fraternity. We call ourselves the Betas. There   s this Christian fraternity that   s also called the Betas, but we   re the multicultural Betas, and we do some pretty amazing things.  Baeza What kind of things?  Saenz Community service, brotherhood events, sports   . Whenever you imagine your group of friends, who get together to do things on a more sociable level, that   s my fraternity.  Baeza What   s the focus for recruiting members?  Saenz We really focus on establishing the family away from home for the students who need that. It   s important to say that whenever you consider any organization, you don   t necessarily have to go Greek to get that family away from home. You can find that just about anywhere, but you have to be able to put in the effort too. We definitely pride ourselves in creating that nice little community for people who need that support system. We definitely pride ourselves on our events, and what we focus on, so different diversity talks, different things going on within the world. We definitely pride ourselves on community service, the amount of hours we do, and some of the things that we get a chance to participate in. Then we definitely pride ourselves on having fun. You have your academic world, and then you have your social world, and then you have your sleep world. It   s a balancing act to work within the three, but once you start integrating them, you can do so much more. It   s pretty amazing.  Baeza Well, thank you very much.  -------  -------
