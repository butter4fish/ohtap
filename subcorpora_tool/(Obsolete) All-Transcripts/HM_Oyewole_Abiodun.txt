Then I get them to say the last.  I say my last name is rhymes the first, I say the first rhymes sound rhymes with the, the third and the second rhymes with the fourth.

Speaker 2: February 25, 1948.
Speaker 1: Place of birth?
Speaker 2: Cincinnati, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is the 13th of December, 2006.
Speaker 1: The location of this interview?
Speaker 2: 110 Morningside Drive, apartment 41.  This is Morningside Drive which is a little strip that falls parallel to Amsterdam Avenue.  It's right, it's the back street of St. John Divine [Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York, New York], St. Luke's Hospital [Mount Sinai St. Luke's, New York, New York] and a whole bunch of Columbia University [New York, New York] buildings.
Speaker 1: So you what are you--occupation, what do you consider yourself (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm an adjunct professor here at Columbia and, and my occupation primarily is being a consultant throughout the city.  What I say, I am a consultant for the board of dead, I'm sort of--board of education [New York City Department of Education], I mean they're killing our kids.  I go into schools I set-up creative classes.  Creative writing workshops, creative science, creative you name, any area of discipline I can make it, I can do a creative number to it.  And with the purpose being to get our kids excited about learning.  And so poetry and rap and song has that, those things have been the basic foundation for my motivation for the kids.  But I've also just had this conversation just simply going to classrooms sitting on a desk, and just talking real talk with the kids.  I get more information out of the kids in one session than some teachers get out of two years.  'Cause, well they may be something they can feel about me because I'm a poet, I'm, I'm like giving the pulse of my people.  Maybe they can connect with that, I don't know what it is but I do know that I, it's been successful.  And then of course I'm running around the country, running around the world or dealing with The Last Poets, and that's been, and that's been very exciting.  Because after all this time, it seems for some people that just getting aware, just becoming aware of who we are.  And I mean there were some kids that were not born when we got started and that is, it's really like in a big thrill for them to find that there were some cats that did, said real funky things.  And came down hard on the system and tried to open up our eyes you know and, and these guys and you can hear what they had to say and they were alive so it become like overwhelming for some people.  And that 'cause they would think that you know with all the stuff that we say all fire came out of our mouths that we'd probably be dead or something.  So that's been exciting.  The Last Poets and teaching when I even on my resume or bio, biographical I always make it clear, very simply who I am a poet slash educator.

Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you five sort of pop culture questions.  Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite what?
Speaker 1: Color.
Speaker 2: You know, I, I really don't have a favorite color per se, I like blue, I like red, I like--I think  colors with me because of my, my feelings you know.  I, I like colors and it's sometimes I like something that's sedate like black or maybe even a white.  It depends upon me; I don't really have a favorite, favorite color. I, it's like how I'm feeling.
Speaker 1: What are you feeling to wear the color you wearing today?
Speaker 2: Well when, I feel like you know I want to be straight forward, when I wearing red, I wanna and red to me is bold, and it makes a, a strong statement of like I'm here.  You can't hide with red on, and, and so whenever I put on anything that's red or maroon, burgundies like that--you know it's, it's really like okay like I knew I was gonna do this interview and I was thinking about what to wear and I was thinking like well I'm only--and I like to keep things simple but I like to keep things in a position that of, of awareness.  And so this is like you know I'm aware you know, red is like boom, I'm aware  what's going on, I'm aware myself I'm aware of what's around me and I'm, and I'm, and I know I'm standing out in that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well I have a, a variety of things that I make with chicken and I suppose and, and fish about even.  I, I cook and I love to cook, cooking is therapeutic for me.  And, and I do a whole I, I have a, I created a nice little variety of dishes that, that I've become fond of.  Like, for example now when it comes to family reunions everybody knows that I'm doing the potato salad.  'Cause I did it a few years ago and it works so well, my mother said, "Well you know that's your job now."  Now, every now and then I make some mac and cheese and people start talking about man you know we don't want nobody else's mac and cheese.  I have to take; I really like the idea of cooking. I do an open house here every Sunday and I'm sure some people would probably tell you that my favorite dish that I make the best is salmon croquettes.  Because I have improved every, every chance I get I make improvements, I mean I got the green peppers, I mean and carrots in my croquettes.  And I stopped using bread crumbs a long time ago, I mean so you really dealing with pure salmon and I'm flavoring so nicely.  I mean it, it's like my whole thing about everything, not just cooking but everything I do I feel like there's an opportunity to improve.  So and then I have a lot of people around me and they always have their particular ingredients that they use and somebody said something that sounds pretty cool.  Like a sister told me a few weeks ago about using scallions in my, in, in my croquettes and that was really lovely.  And I took the scal- I use the scallions in place of the onions and it was really very nice and it was a different flavor.  And in another week before that I tried some curry so I have some curry croquettes you know.  So I mean I, I enjoy a number of dishes and chicken and fish that's the basic that's, that's those are the, those are the basic ingredients for most of the dishes that I make.

Speaker 1: What about a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of year well I love my birthday time February 25th, because I'm never in this country. I'm, when I was incarcerated, I had made a plan in my mind that when I got out of prison I would, I would not cel- at, once I got out and had money I would celebrate my birthday someplace outside of America where there was sun, sand sea.  And much of this really was spurred on by listening to Jon Lucien while I'm laying up in a prison cot.  He had just come out 1972 or '71 [1971] or whatever with a, with this, this I mean it was like the beach on wax.  I mean his voice was just so luscious you could hear the waves hitting the shore in the background and then what he's saying about--I mean it was just, and I'm in, in prison down in North Carolina where everything is rough.  It sounds terrible and nothing is flowing like that so I just like, I became enchanted.  And I said point-blank to myself that whenever I have an opportunity to, when I get out here and I have an opportunity financially to travel I'm going to the place where that voice takes me.  And actually I think it was like the third year of travel, well first of all, the first, my first year out back here in New York City [New York, New York] I met Jon and we hung out.  'Cause he was playing bass for the play 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope.'  A lot of people probably had no idea that one of the greatest singers one of the greatest crooners on the planet was playing bass for, for that play.  The play was okay it wasn't, it wasn't no big deal it was, it was a little, it was a little above a minstrel show I guess but he was in the pit playing bass.  And then, and then he started getting gigs singing around and plays his guitar.  And we, and we, and I met him, I think I met him at the play 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,' and he and I and Leon Thomas became very famous friends.  And, and then the third year of my travelling I went to his home, which was St. Thomas.  And I was surprised to see that most of the, a lot of the people didn't know who he was 'cause he had blown up over here.  He didn't really blow up over there, and but yeah that, that's, that's probably so when you say my favorite time of the year, it's probably my birthday.  Because I'm never here (laughter).

Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination of all, of the places you've been?
Speaker 2: Any, any island where the sand is soft and the water is clear, any island.  I mean you know where the people, where black people are and, and it's beautiful as I know them to be.  Especially on their island, I mean any island, any island, Antigua, Barbados, Trinidad, Tobago, (unclear), Aruba, Bohemia [ph.], Costa Rica, Guatemala, any island.  Honduras, I mean these are all places I've already been and, and of course the top of the list of those islands too I have to put in Brazil and Colombia.  Because I go to Colombia a lot because Colombia is closer than Africa and is very much like Africa and the people are-- you know I, I try, and one of the, of the other reasons why I do travel is because I'm, I meet angels I meet angles everywhere in the world.  I go to places anywhere I go on the planet I know I'm going to meet an angel and I know why because I know I'm an angel, and so angels work together.  And, and I don't always take their number and follow-up, there's no follow-up like oh I was just thinking about you, how you doing you know unh-uh.  When I'm, when I'm dealing with my, when I'm traveling whether it's The Last Poet [The Last Poets] gig or it's a gig just for my own pleasure and I meet some people that are beautiful, we're having a beautiful moment.  And unless that person comes through here or and sometimes I might go back but that's rare, we don't find, very rarely.  I think 90 percent of the times I've met people I've not followed-up with, with seeing them again; you know it was just that moment was so precious.  And I remember them and I'm sure they remember me because in most sit, situations there was a conflict and it needed to be resolved and that's when angels show up you know.  And I mean I was on a boat coming from Morocco and I had been in Morocco for about eleven days spent all my money, smoked a lot of hash, met a lot of beautiful people, had a, stayed, stayed in a fantastic villa.  That was actually owned by one of the biggest hash dealers in the world and he was in prison because he was also a member of parliament.  And his son was like my angel I mean I just, this kid rode along the side of my, me I was with a lady and he rode on the side of the car on a motorbike with a friend on it, with a male friend of his on the back of the motorbike.  And he asked me if I wanted to get high and I said yeah, I said of course (laughter) and so he said follow me Amigo Mio that's all he ever called me.  I know I think he knows my name but I was Amigo Mio from that moment on.  And we, oh it was one of the greatest adventures of my life.  Eighteen year-old kid who spoke nine languages who had taken over the hash business for his father in Morocco.  And he lied to his mother and told his mother that in order for me and my friend to stay in his villa, his, his, he told his mother that we were American teachers to come to get him to go back to school.  'Cause he had been kicked out of the Moroccan academy, the Spanish academy, the French academy every single school from whatever language he had been get dismissed.  Because he was disruptive, he didn't like the school and he was really too smart for school and when we met, it was magic it was absolutely magic.  And we went all over Morocco all over Kenitra [Morocco], Tetouan [Morocco], Fez [Morocco], Rabat [Morocco].  I mean it was, it was crazy.  Because this kid had so much knowledge and he was so full of life, I wrote a song about him a major song about this kid.  I, I've recorded it but I some years ago when I had my jazz group.  But yeah, I've had some major moments, but traveling to me has been connecting with angels.

Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite saying?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I don't have any particular favorite saying.  There are, there are a number of nuggets of wisdom that have been imparted to us by many great people.  At any point I might, I have a, I have a very good memory so I've got like a collection of sayings in my head.  When I'm teaching poetry for example, some days I just do proverbs you know and I'll write on the board, "You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink."  "Don't count your chickens before they're hatched."  "Intelligent enemy is better than a stupid friend."  "Man chases woman 'til she catches him."  You know I'll write them on the board and then we have discussion about it and I'll point out the poetry in them because that's most of the time my major emphasis.  But the real deal is I'll say many of us were raised by these statements, many of us have parents and grandparents that would hit you in the head with that stuff when you do something stupid.  You know you count your chickens before they're hatched you gonna get this, you gonna get this and you end up with nothing.  I mean that's just some more frustration so we live, I say day by day I see these proverbs never, never never die.  And then you got other expressions that I've, that I like that other, that many great leaders have used like Malcolm [Malcolm X] for example that dealing with our discussion of us being African.  He says you know, "Just because a cat has kittens in the oven don't make them biscuits."  I love those expressions but see I'm a poet so I'm moved by poet re, re statements poetic expressions that, that, tie it all up, wrap it up, give it to you in a way that you can really work with it. That, that excites me and for example an expression this week, all this week from my classes has been, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."  Because this country right now is running a serious fear game on everybody and they know that once I got you afraid I can just about do anything I want to do with you.  And so a lot of people bought the, bought the line, a lot of people are walking around here afraid and is really nothing to be afraid of, absolutely nothing.  And I mean absolutely nothing to be afraid of, absolutely.  And that, and the fear factor is the one thing that constipates all the circuits, right away. The minute you start feeling free you start cutting yourself short, you start cutting situations short.  You start; you stop actually being all you can possibly be you know you restrict your own possibilities when you start having fear.  So I use the line from [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt also echoed by Churchill [Winston Churchill], fear is the only thing you have to fear is fear itself.  So any good line and reading 'Siddhartha' I give, I'm always teaching taking lines from 'Siddhartha' by Hermann Hesse it's a little 60 page book and, well 120 maybe.  But, but it's then a bunch of chunky lines, "Reading is fine but thinking is better," you know.  "I can wait, I can fast, and I can think." I'm always giving that to the kids. I said if you do those three things then you will have success, you will be successful automatically.  Then I break down what's waiting, we--discussion was fasting, have a discussion what's thinking, have a discussion.  And you'd be surprised a lot of times you see fasting, people just think it's not like eating food.  I say no it's doing without anything that you like to do you know fasting is just putting stuff on hold, especially stuff that you might like to do.  You know and just deal with yourself for moment.  So there are, there are hundreds of expressions that I like and that pop into my head at convenient times.
Story_ID: 364366
Speaker 1: And I play 'Jeopardy!' all the time too because it's, it's the show isn't have no, no cultural or ethnicity to relate to me 'cause they definitely kind of like boycott black people on that show.  In terms of questions and they give a bunch of black questions that are so simple it's like what comes after A you know B, what comes after C you know.  It's very, very elementary I mean it's not really getting into the crux because where deep people, we've done some deep things.  But I watch it to exercise my brain and I also watch it to keep my reading tight because in teaching, I always let the kids know that if you can read you can, you can answer all whole lot of questions without even really knowing the subject if you can read.  Because a lot of times, a question, many questions especially the game show the answer is in the question.  And so, the, the so, in order for you to really understand that then reading becomes a major thing.  Reading becomes more than just I can decipher the, the code of the, of the letters and the words that these letters make that's settle, that's elementary that's nothing.  'Cause the words, the words are chosen for a particular reason the, there's an expression that's being said.  And, and if there's a question that resolves from all that then you got to figure out from what the information given how you can come with the answer and that means you might have to read beyond the word you know.  Or above say between the lines and might be between the lines, above the lines below the lines, but you have to you know.  I always give the kids example I say if I say to you, "Of all the murderers on, in the world he was a cut above the rest."  I said that's an example I mean you know.  And I, then I do that I always give them examples, 'cause I think that the best way to teach is to give examples.  If you just teach, you're talking, you running off at the mouth you're saying a lot of things, you can be flowery.  It could be highfalutin on a lot levels but it doesn't work until the person that you're trying to communicate to gets it and when they get it, and when they, it, it just--their, their eyes light up you know your heart lights up, everything happens.  It's exciting, exciting but the idea, so the, and that's another one of the expressions that I use.  I say, "Power of an example is the most moving force," you know, and I don't know if I made it up or heard it from somebody but I've been using for a lot, a long, long time.  But when you come to the favorite expressions, I, I have, I have so many, and they, they just, and I, I function like that.  When looking for little things that I can give you and you that you can take and walk with and help yourself.
Speaker 2: So before we move on you said they come to you when you need them.  So you know or in the moment you, you know what's right, what's right for this moment as far as the saying?
Speaker 1: Oh well, oh, oh saying oh this moment.
Speaker 2: For this moment, yeah for this moment.
Speaker 1: This, this moment is, is classic this is my son has the expression that he came up with, when The Last Poets were really getting back together and it was a press conference here in New York City [New York, New York].  I was totally in disagreement with attending the press conference and being a part, being back in The Last Poets to me is like remarrying a woman I had divorced, you know I wasn't interested in that you know.  I mean I did this already I, it was a platform for me to boom and move on, and my son the expression that caused me to be back in the saddle of what I'm doing today and the expression for today is, "You never know you're creating history when you're creating it."  And when my son told me that, he humbled me and he made me go to the press conference.  He said, "Pops, I know you don't like them guys anymore, I know you don't like to deal with them."  He says, "But I was only a baby when you all got the group started, I was born in '68 [1968]," he says, "I don't know those guys.  I mean and I, and everybody knows my father's was one of The Last Poets and I have my friends and they know that but, I don't know the other guys in the group."  And I said, "Yeah, okay so what you trying to tell me, you wanna go?"  He said, "Yeah let's go to the press conference."  And on, on the way down to the press conference which was at 34th Street at the Dumont Hotel [Dumont NYC, New York, New York], my son says, "Pops, you never know you're creating history when you're doing it."  And I just whew, and I and, and I don't know if I gave him his props right then and there but I have to use that expression.  Because you don't, you really have no idea, I was about my business, I was about doing what I felt had to be done.  I wasn't trying to get notoriety, I wasn't trying, I wasn't trying to do anything that was going to blow me up in any way.  I only felt that my strength was, my voice, my presence, my words the group that we had going what knowledge whatever little bit of knowledge that I had and I was full throttle.

Speaker 1: What do you believe is the role of a parent?
Speaker 2: The role of?
Speaker 1: Of a parent.
Speaker 2: The role of a parent (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The role of the parent yeah.
Speaker 2: The role, the role of a parent is, is to really provide a healthy space, a healthy environment and to be sincere in your actions so that the--'cause the children are watching you all the time.  The role of a parent is to be a facilitator, to be an exampler, if there's such a word to be somebody that provides examples and to be, it's, it's tricky to be cognizant of, of your child.  I mean you have to be aware for example a lot of people say you know you should block certain things on TV.  You should not let the kids hear certain things, and I've always disagreed with that, I always thought that that was tired.  Because if I'm a kid and I know you blocking some stuff on TV man that stuff on TV becomes the most exciting stuff.  I don't want to see nothing else.  I only want to see what you blocked.  If you wanna ban something that's become, that becomes my passion I mean that's and that's human nature.  You're gonna find very few human beings will stay still and stay shut up when told to be quiet, that's just not natural.  God gave us too many things to work with.  So you know that's when it comes to dealing with working on trying to imagine dealing with raising your child in an environment like this where you got so many, many influences you don't--I don't believe in cutting off.  I believe in checking out, I believe in sitting with the kids and watching what they watch and expressing my opinion.  "Man that's horrible shit, that's disgusting, man what is he doing?  I mean wait, is everybody gay on the show?"  I mean you know I will say exactly so in my doing that I am automatically giving up values to my kids.  And it blows my mind because there's no formal nothing but I have come into the situation to rooms when my kids are talking to other kids saying the exact same thing that I have said to them.  And I didn't even know they heard me and then I had to remind myself and say oh.  And then I have to also check myself and say well I got to make sure that I don't say anything that I don't want to hear later.  Because these kids are parrots.  They take everything, so you don't know but, but and the other thing is being accessible I mean 'cause I'm not an orthodox parent but my kids all know how to get to me and they all know where I'm at.  And they all have been with me and they've run away from home to stay with me I mean from their mother's house.  So I don't, I don't deal with the parent thing on the same level I think that, I think it's, I think the parenting in America has become extremely hard because we're being very, very unrealistic about this little union of mother and fathers, sisters and brothers at, it's become a real fake world in many, many ways.  Because a lot of times in the, in the family that looks together, ain't nobody together.  The father got something else happening, the mother got something else happening, each of the kids got their own thing happening.  But yet it appears if you look in the window that this is a family and, and maybe sometimes they are a family.  But there's too much individuality happening and not enough understanding of the div, of the individuals, and a lot of times people don't care.
Story_ID: 364368
Speaker 1: What I try to do is--'cause I, I parent a lot of folks, and not my biological, I, it's the same thing you know I'm here.  To give, if you want advice you can ask me I will make a suggestion you know for some things, but I'm not a, I'm not a lecturer, I'm not a I'm not a beater down.  I don't you know there's certain things that I think you need to go through and, and pain sometimes is important and suffering sometimes. And struggling sometimes all of that is very, very important and I cannot eliminate that for you.  But if you are in my environment I'm definitely going to make whatever basic comforts that you can enjoy, you're gonna have that.  Just because I'm not going to be comfortable if you're around you're not comfortable.  So if you're around I'm gonna, I don't ever cook for me, I never cook for me.  If I cook anything at all it's with the thought in mind that somebody else is gonna be coming to the door.  So it's, and, and if nobody's is here, that means this food I got I made a, a batch of food for whenever people do come over.  So I, I do a lot of things because I see the need for them to be done and, and parenting is, is like that and it's not a big mystery.  It's being honest with people, it's being straightforward, it's like letting them know and even though they're your blood that they're not your blood.  And that's in dealing with those expressions again. I'm going back to Kahlil Gibran, "Your children are not your children /...their life's longing for itself," ['On Children'].  So if you got somebody in your family like, I've been asked many questions suppose you got a son or daughter that's gay, how would you feel about it?  I said how could I feel about it I said I'm not down the gay thing I ain't, I'm not in that world.  I have no, no I'm not championing that.  But if my daughter or, or my son happens to be gay, they still gonna be my daughter and they still gonna be my son and hopefully we're still gonna have a good relationship.  I can't, who they sleep with and how they're deal with the things that they do in their private life I have no control over it.  I don't know what pushes them, what, what passion they have.  Just because they may have come from some of my DNA that doesn't mean they gonna be like me.  And I've even had people say things like you have boys, you have four boys, ooh, I bet they just like you.  I say no I say I would never want that this is my road and I don't, I have a hard time dealing with the road my damn self.  I wouldn't want anybody else to be pulling road, that's not fair they need to be on their own road.  And they need to find their own road, that's what life's about, you find a comfort zone for yourself and you work it.  And if you work it sincerely and honestly along the way you will get help.
Story_ID: 364369
Speaker 1: You were just talking about the role of the parent.  The reason I asked that question because I'm segueing into talking about your own parents.  And your mother, your mother, if you could give me your mother's full name, her date of birth, and place of birth.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well my, my natural mother her name is Mattie Mae Robinson [Mattie Robinson Dawson] and I was born in Cincinnati [Ohio] and I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was she born, I mean her?
Speaker 2: She was born in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: In Atlanta, okay, do you know her date of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, October 24th, 1926, and--
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk to you about her childhood in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  We, she's given us stories and my mother tells great stories.  She, she had a unique childhood, because my grandfather who I did meet and knew in the last few years of his life.  He, he was a very special black man he had all kinds of talents and skills and all kinds of strengths.  He was a, he was the first, well let's go back.  He first played in General Pershing's [John J. Pershing] band, the Hellfighters [Harlem Hellfighters], he played horn, he played all kinds of horns.  He played every instrument that you can imagine; he never fought anybody during World War I [WWI].  They had band contests and he even told me the story about this woman saying, "Is the true you have a tail?"  Because I was told that you have, all you black guys have tails.  And he said, "Yeah I got a tail, if you got a room I'll show you my tail."  So he and he said that most of the black guys whenever they were confronted like that, they would not offended.  They would flip it, they would turn it around, they didn't protest and say oh we need to call the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or whatever.  It probably didn't exist then anyway.  But they just wouldn't take whatever the, the derogatory statement was and just flip it and make it work in their behalf.  And granddaddy was special like that his name was Charles Franklin Robinson [Charles Robinson].  And actually I was named after him and he was a musician, then when he came to Cincinnati from Atlanta 'cause that's where--I think he was born in Atlanta and I believe, and I know my mother was born in Atlanta and moved to Cincinnati.  And he actually was the very, he had, he was the very, he was the first licensed brick mason, black brick mason in Cincinnati, and he opened up a candy store.  He made Bonbons, he invented Bonbons, but you're not gonna find my grandfather's name on the list for the invention of Bonbons.  They were some chocolate covered coconut stuff that he had put together and he called them Bonbons, he got that expression from being over in France, and being in Paris [France] and he came back. And, and now I mean of course I'm sure there's a bunch of companies like probably like Nabisco or somebody who will claim you know ownership of that.  But my grandfather made candy that people will come from miles just to get, I mean he made the peanut brittle, I remembered that in particular.  Because we ate that death out of that, he made a lot just lot of good candy.  I mean peppermint stick, and mama even talks about when she, as a child just seeing the way he made the peppermint stick, you know the whole process.  She was enchanted by it. He also could draw and, and he had different cartoons that he had in the store to like just spark your mind and at the same time be entertaining for your vision while you're waiting.

Speaker 1: There's one great, great story my mother [Mattie Robinson Dawson] tells of how, you see back in the days, back in the '30s [1930s] of or, or and '40s [1940s].  If a black man in particular was raising a girl child by himself the, the social system would take the child away.  A black man was not allowed to raise his daughter.  It was almost like they were saying that we had this heathen thing happening, this savage thing happening, that we would rape our daughters.  That or, or have something, do something that was totally just undesired, that's, that's never been us, that's never been us.  White folks have a long history of doing all kinds of weird stuff with their kids, but that's not one of the things that black people have been put on the, on the, the carpet about.  That's not one of our problems.  But, but the insults are there and it was a known thing that in the, that community in Cincinnati [Ohio] that my mother was being raised without--'cause my grandfather [Charles Robinson] had my grandmother, my mother's mother died when she was six from pneumonia.  And so my mother never really knew her, and of course I never knew her.  And my mo- and according to mommy, if you would've talk to her she'd tell you that she had twenty-six mothers, while she was growing up.  So granddaddy liked women and women loved him, and, and yet they live together just the two of them 'cause my mother, I mean my aunt [Elvenia Robinson Davis] who became my mother later, it's a long wild story.  She had moved out 'cause she was sixteen years older than my natural mother, then her sister who was my mom.  But during the time that mommy was with granddaddy by herself, the social service people came to the house after somebody ratted on them, said, "There's black man here raising this black girl here by himself," and he had stepped out, or he was in the store, I think he was in a candy store.  And the people came in the house, mommy was eleven and the guys, the people, it was a woman and a man.  And the woman says, "Where is your father at?"  She says, "He's at the store, at the candy store," so she says, "Well who cleans up your house?"  And she's walking around, she got a pad and she, and she says, "My--nobody cleans up my house."  She says, "I, I do the cleaning, me and my father."  And so she, then she went, then the, the real, the real thing that finally made the decision, made the determining decision was she went into the kitchen.  And back then they used to use this, this cornstarch when they, when they ironed stuff you know.  So all of her dresses for school were cornstarched probably to death, hanging like, like some kind of cardboard sheet up in the kitchen.  And about four or five, all of her dresses for the week hang, hanging up, ironed.  So the lady says, "Well who comes in here to do, what lady comes in here to do your ironing?"  And my mother said, "No lady comes in here to do my ironing that, my daddy did that."  And she says, "Well I'm putting down on this paper that there's a woman in this house."  And that, that 'til this day is one of those great stories because we know what they were doing to us they keeping the family divided and hurting us in every possible way.  But here was a situation my grandfather was so tight with his lifestyle and taking care of his daughter until the people that came to really cause him trouble had to walk away.  So mommy talks about that story a lot and she talks about all the different women that she got, try to remember these names.  'Cause this one here's another mother for you, here's another mother for you, here's another.  And she had to call her Ma this, Ma that, Ma this, Ma that, as she did that until she, she left, moved out to stay with--'cause he had a mean woman or girlfriend or something.  And they didn't get along and so mommy left and moved right across the street to where my aunt was living, her sister.  And, and she became her guardian and so forth and, but she the, those stories that she tells us of our, of her youth with granddaddy, I mean it was just so special.  Because he was very much into her and he did everything, and, and he, and he actually, you can hear, you can see it in her face and hear it in her voice.  He made himself a hero to his daughter and he couldn't really do any wrong 'cause he provided, he did all things, plus he had this candy thing going on.  And oh the candy store matter-of-fact evolved into a restaurant.  And so he got even bigger, so he was successful at whatever he did, and it, and he believed in hard, hard work.  But mommy talks about him with such endearment and, and I know how wonderful he was because I had a chance to spend time with him.

Speaker 1: Mommy [Mattie Robinson Dawson] was like Virgin Mary in the church.  She was cute, she was always dressed up, she always looked good.  And, and she was, she was one of God's hand-picked maidens you know, so here she is twenty, twenty-one years old in a church.  Some dude like finds my mother attractive and joins the church just to get to her, and this dude become my father, and--
Speaker 2: Your father's name?
Speaker 1: James Smith, which I always think that's funny 'cause I don't really know if that's his name.  It sounds like a name you just picked out of a hat, but that's the name that she told me. I never seen him.  He joined the church, wooed my mother, they got down and I came, but I was born in a home for unwed mothers.  Because back in that period, you couldn't have a child without husband and stuff, walk around and be seen as a respectful woman.  And plus my mother have been in the church and she had been in the church so much until everybody knew that she was gonna ascend to heaven, and now she's done one of these, these terribly earthly things like getting pregnant and she was twenty-one which was perfectly fine.  Now you get pregnant at twenty-one you're not, nobody is gonna guide or the test tube or nothing.  And you walk around and, and show your belly off, she was hiding.  I was born in hiding in Catherine Booth memorial home for unwed mothers [Catherine Booth Home], which is Cincinnati [Ohio].  It still is there and my mother was dark and gloomy or a dark side scorpion stuff came out.  She became dark, gloomy, not happy, sad, depressed most of the time, and as a little bitty baby I can feel it.  As a little child I was totally aware of the fact that she was not happy.  And I was totally aware of the fact that as a little baby in the crib, that I needed to be with somebody who would turn on the lights, would have flowers in their house, candy, hugs, kisses, I knew I needed that.  And every time I would go to my aunt's [Elvenia Robinson Davis] house, her sister, I got that she was love personified, it was nobody on the planet that loved me more, and that I needed more in my life.  And consequently that was the beginning of the end of my relationship with my mother through those developmental years.
Story_ID: 364372
Speaker 1: I, my mother--my aunt [Elvenia Robinson Davis] moved to New York City [New York, New York].  And I was raised, I was take, actually my aunt moved to New York City after she got married to a man who was providing my grandfather [Charles Robinson] with meat from Georgia.  The man's name Daddy Joe, it was Joseph Davis.  And I ended up calling him Daddy Joe.  He used to provide meat for my grandfather's restaurant, my mother [Mattie Robinson Dawson] was working in the restaurant, my aunt was working in the restaurant.  And my au- of course my aunt was older than my mother, so her and granddaddy probably worked at all the business details.  Plus she could burn; oh this woman could cook anything, anything.  And she had a relationship with the guy that was bringing in the meat from he was coming from Georgia, she's in Cincinnati [Ohio].  They get together decide they gonna go to New York, and they got packed up and everything and coming in, they getting ready to New York.  And I saw my aunt leaving me in Cincinnati with my mother who was all messed up; I mean she still was just depressed.  I, I went upstairs and I got my cowboy hat, my guns, my holster, my vest, my boots and I came downstairs and said, "I'm going to New York too."  I was three years old and 'til this day that's probably the biggest story that you can get about my early life from all my relatives is Cincinnati.  'Cause they, everybody's thing was like man, we knew you were serious but we thought you'd be back before now.  I didn't go back until forty something years later, I mean everybody just, but my Aunt Vivian she says you know, "We knew you had to go 'cause you was serious.  You came downstairs with that hat and those, them guns and boots and you was serious.  You weren't joking, you had on your favorite gear."  And I sa- and I told everybody I said, "I'm going to New York with Aunt Veen."  I was calling her Aunt Veen at the time.  And on the way from New York, from Cincinnati, New York she became my mother.
Story_ID: 364373
Speaker 1: And then my mother [Mattie Robinson Dawson], natural mother came to New York [New York] about a year later, but she didn't have no more status, none.  I would even pay any attention to her hardly 'cause, cause my aunt [Elvenia Robinson Davis] was joy, she was joy.  But my mother and I, I'm fortunate because since I've been grown, my aunt passed away some years ago, me and my mother are closer than ten toes in one sock, we're real close.  I mean she's, she's now mom for real she's kicked in you know she's got four other kids of course and everything, I mean it's grandkids for days.  But she's like the supermom now, she wasn't ready to be that when I was born, she's more, she's more than ready now.  She's special, you know but her childhood was exceptionally exciting because she had an exceptional pops [Charles Robinson].
Speaker 2: What do you think it was that turned the light off for her that?
Speaker 1: Oh, she got married, she got married again, she found (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I said turned it off you know when she--
Speaker 1: Oh turned it--
Speaker 2: Turned the light off, you said you know with her father she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no, no, no what, what, what turned the light on for the fact that she had disgraced the family.
Speaker 2: With getting pregnant?
Speaker 1: Getting.
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean yet that, that in 1948 that's serious, that's serious, '48 [1948], '49 [1949],'50 [1950] that's very serious, I mean just disavowed everybody.  I mean then plus you're talking about communities like Cincinnati, Ohio is not a big city, it's a, it's a city but it's really just a glorified town.  And oh no, that's very, very that's, that's a big stigma back in the days, oh now it's, it's a point of praise, you know.  It's like, "Ooh, girl you pregnant.  Ooh when you due?"  Nobody's asking about the, the dude or nothing but then (shakes head) that's like, "Oh, shame on you."  And, and they had a place.  I mean if you got a whole building designed for women to get pregnant that can't be wal- walking around the street so I mean I was born in Catherine, Catherine Booth memorial home for unwed mothers [Catherine Booth Home, Cincinnati, Ohio].  And I don't think you can get more depressed than that just the name itself you know here you are, you're a mother but you're unwed.  And we have a whole building, a whole structure dedicated to your kind, that's not happiness, and then she just wasn't happy.  She, she really took being pregnant bad.  One of the stories she tells is that my, the, the wife of the guy of my so-called father [James Smith] came to the house and said you know, "We'll take Charles [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole] and we'll raise him with our other, with my other kids, and just like he's my son."  And I think my mother might've, my natural mother, might've been entertaining that idea.  Man my aunt wasn't having that.  She said, "Over my dead body you will," and she says, "and let me tell you self, tell you something else you let your husband know, if I see him, I'm killing him."  And, and my aunt was serious, she already had a reputation of cutting a few people, I mean she would've cut that man up.  She, he'd be in some kind of dish that my grandfather would've been serving in that restaurant.  I'm serious, she, 'cause she protected mommy.  Mommy was the angel, mommy was Virgin Mary, blackface you know.  She dre- her sister would dress her up, daddy, daddy, granddaddy would take care of her, she look, always looked good.  She's always, she was always very just well-mannered, she always spoke well, she's got--mommy's got a lot of, of character, she's got a lot of, of just good positive energy in terms of how to present oneself.  The thing that I got from her that I didn't particularly care at the time was the deep dark depression because I had entered into her life in an untimely way.
Story_ID: 364374
Speaker 1: Did you ever know the name of the what the restaurant was that your [maternal] grandfather [Charles Robinson] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But no I never knew the name of the restaurant I'm sure I can call my mother [Mattie Robinson Dawson] she'd probably tell me name of it.  But no I didn't know the name of it.
Speaker 1: You know even where it was located in Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: I guess you were too young to remember anything about Cincinnati.
Speaker 2: Yeah I didn't know anything about that, I knew, matter-of-fact Oliver Street one of the streets that they talk about where maybe the store was on or the restaurant or whatever, it's been wiped out and--
Speaker 1: But Oliver Street was probably the black strip--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was part of the--
Speaker 1: That had all the--
Speaker 2: Part of the deal of the black strip and it was wiped out by a highway yeah and that's, they do that. If black people get too cozy, and too strength, too empowered, they'll throw a highway say public domain, run a highway through it.  I mean the most classic example that of course I mean we all should be aware of this the black Wall Street.  The black Wall Street was that, that's a classic example how the governmental, governmental racism can be just overmuch. I mean it can be an ultimate killer because here was a, here's a town in Tulsa, Oklahoma that had over 657 businesses, 19 black millionaires in 1920, 1921.  I mean we were loaning money, we actually loaned money to D.W. Griffin [sic. D.W. Griffith] to do that stupid movie 'Birth of a Nation' ['The Birth of a Nation'].  We were loaning other people money anything that you wanted to get fixed, you wanted your rug cleaned, you wanted this done, you wanted this done, you come to see us.  'Cause it's all about the black folks who had been runoff the plantations of the Louisiana 'cause when the Emancipation Proclamation came, they had to get the hell out of there, because, now the white folks had to lose their slaves, said you all gon lose yours too.  Because there was some black people that had, they had, they were living large the Creoles, they were (unclear) but they had, they realize that they were reduced back to being niggers, so they, they got together with the Muscogee Indians [Native Americans].  And they all went to, because you had the Indians coming from the Trail of Tears, all the way from Georgia, they had to walk all the way to Oklahoma.  And then you hooked up with the blacks from Louisiana and the, and the Muscogee and man we talking about the creation.  They called, the town had two names, little Africa and black Wall Street and those towns, that town was so thriving.  I mean the largest hospital, the largest school, the largest church; the largest bank was all black people.  And that's so hard for any black person to imagine that we had that in this country, in this lifetime, it's hard to believe.  But it was bombed, it was bombed by to the, to crop dusters and dropped two bombs on the town in 1921.  Wiped the town out, killed over four hundred people, wiped out twelve thousand homes, and it's never been discussed like it's supposed to because people will fear that there will be a mass outcry.  It'll be, and there would've been then and there would be right now.  'Cause whenever I lecture and talk about black Wall Street people say, "Is that true? Is that true?"  And I say, "Why don't you just go online?"  Since everybody's got a computer and you can go online and find out stuff that you didn't know was true.  Take my word for it, just type in black Wall Street and hit search, Google it, Yahoo it, Doodle it whatever and, and you will find out what I'm saying.  And then people call me back, "Oh man I never knew about it."  There's so many things that we don't know about, 'cause we don't run the media, we don't run the books, we don't, we don't write the stuff mass-produce it and say, "I think people should know about this."  No they're not, no people should know about Puff and Spot look at Dick, see Sally run, ha, ha, ha, I mean that's basically what they want you to have.  But like we, we always been the people who have had, first of all we were brought here because we were the greatest resources on the planet, we can do stuff.  You don't bring a bunch of people to some country, I don't care if you call them slaves, call them servants, call them whatever you want, and they can do stuff, they can do anything.  You got a hoe that's broken and needs to be fixed and a black man he ain't never been to no school to fix nothing, but he fixed the hoe, he's out there working.  There's a cow sick he ain't producing no milk somebody comes up his belly say some stuff, next day the cow is producing milk for days.  I mean we, we're magical people and our magic, the country has capitalized off of our magic and is still capitalizing off of our magic.  And a lot of us don't even know that we have magic, so.
Story_ID: 364375
Speaker 1: When you moved to New York [New York] at age three (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you?
Speaker 2: Jamaica, came to South Jamaica Queens [New York] we lived in a real run-down house with my folks somehow and I remember it, all I remember of the house was that it was run-down.  But somehow we made it work, we even had a garden you know I mean it was amazing on 156th Street.  I'll never forget, I remember when I first time I saw a dead person; I was going to the store.  I had came back, I was like, I guess I was about seven or something, eight I don't know, and I just saw this body covered up and I saw the shoes.  And every time I saw those brown, it was tan kind of shoes, I always equate them with a dead man.  It was amazing.  Yeah the growing up in Queens we had, we were at 50, 156th Street for, a very short while.  What happened is that my mother now, we're talking about my aunt when I say mother.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean my aunt.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: My mother.
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Elvenia Davis [Elvenia Robinson Davis].
Speaker 1: Elvenia.
Speaker 2: Elvenia Davis.
Speaker 1: And what was her date of birth?  Your mother was a Scorpio what was she?
Speaker 2: My, my aunt was a Leo, and it was, and everything she did was with all her heart she was August 12th, what year I don't remember.  But sixteen years before mommy [Mattie Robinson Dawson], so mommy was born in '26 [1926], so we go down to sixteen and then you take six from that.  So '10 [1910] she must've been born in, in 1910 and just, just like her sign the Leo big, big heart.  I mean when we gave parties.  They were parties, man, and people ate well, mother was nurturing.  She could never have any children; I don't know what her problem was.  I don't know what the, what the medical problem I'm not sure what the real problem was but she couldn't have any kids, and I was her kid.  And, and I was proud, happy to be her child, I remember as a kid one of the things the first argument that I remember her having with Daddy Joe, Joseph Davis was her husband's name, and he became my father.  And she bought me a diamond ring and I was just starting school, I was in kindergarten, yeah I think I was in kindergarten.  And, my hands are getting big, I was growing, I was a baby and, and I took off the ring 'cause it was obviously hurting my finger.  And my hands were maybe getting a little too chubby for it and I put it on top of the windowsill I remember that, and that's what I remember.  And so that evening it was this big fight between my mother and Daddy Joe behind yeah I know that boy didn't know nothing about no diamond ring, you buying a diamond.  She said I spent my own money; I did not spend money for the house.  I decided that that if the ring is gone so it's gone, so but I decided to do that that was me.  He says, and they, they went back and forth and back and forth, but that's the kind of stuff she would do, she would adorn me, she would, she would give me.  She would buy the special presents, she would make special cakes and pies I mean she spoiled me rotten, and but she did it with a, a firm grip.  She didn't just let everything fly loose.
Story_ID: 364376
Speaker 1: But Daddy Joe [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] was there to make sure that everything was real tight.  Because he was the opposite, he was a worker, he was mean.  He believed that, spare the rod spoil the child.  He believe that a, a child is not working is a child that was no good, you know what I mean?  So I had to work we had a rule, he had a rule that said I gotta be up at 5:30 in the morning, everybody in this house will be up at 5:30.  That was how I was raised.  I had to be up at the house, I had to be up every morning at 5:30.
Speaker 2: To do what?
Speaker 1: To feed the chickens, feed the rabbits, put, give the dog some water, I had chores, I had chores.  Daddy Joe brought Georgia to Queens [New York] and he was serious, I had to weed the garden.  I got beat one time because I was taking a hoe and I was chopping the weeds off at the head and he took the hoe and turned it around and almost beat the hell out of me.  Because he said, "Boy, that--weeds don't get taken care of like that, you got to pull the weeds up by the root." He said, "If you don't get to the root, it still killing the plants," and he made it really clear to me.  So that meant that every time when it came time for weeding the garden I have to get down, crouch position and pull the weeds.  People don't know what it takes to grow anything, I know, and the one thing I can say about my father is that because of him there is no place can put me on the planet where I can't survive.  Nothing you can do to upset, to upset my lifestyle, you know I mean I do try to design a comfortable lifestyle for myself.  But put into a situation that looks a little less comfortable than this, it's okay, I'm prepared I'm more than prepared.  I mean I know how to work, I know how to hammer, I know how to nail, I know how to saw.  I know how to paint, I know how to rake leaves, I know how to shovel snow, I know how to build a post for a post hole digger so you can make a fence.  I know how to build a house, I can build, I can build a chair, I can take a car apart and put it back together, my father gave me all of that.  When I was twelve years old a car dropped on me, the motor was out, the motor was up on the, it was on the board, it was on the hook and, and chain.  So thank God for that, but the car was up on some jacks and somehow the jacks got just un, unbalanced, and the car just fell off the jacks.  And I was underneath the car at the time I don't know what I was doing underneath the car but it was up so I could, I don't know he had, he had me doing something.  Anyway the car came down and I just put my hands up like that and stopped it from crushing me (laughter) and my and my fa- I was twelve.  And my father said, "Hold that car boy, hold that car."  And I held it, I'm here, and that evening that was the conversation that boy held that--my mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] went crazy.  She says, "Joe that boy could've been killed, are you crazy, are you sick?"  That's, that's when my mother decided that I need to go to boarding school [Woodycrest, Bronx, New York], (laughter) so, I went to boarding school after that when I was about eleven or twelve.
Story_ID: 364377
Speaker 1: Your father [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] and holding up the car, and that experience but was that still in Queens [New York] or you--
Speaker 2: That was in Queens.
Speaker 1: That was in Queens.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was raised in Queens I, from, I went from Cincinnati [Ohio] to Queens.
Speaker 1: And you said at that point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went from the, I guess I have to write that line eventually.  I went from the Queen City to Queens because Cincinnati is nicknamed, one of the nicknames is Queen City.  Has a few nicknames Sin City, Queen City, Blue Chip Town, City of Seven Hills.  So because and because I'm not in Sin City, even though I was born, I get a lot of information.  Because it's like you know looking on the outside inside of my life you know and so but like yeah.
Speaker 1: You said at that point your mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] decided to send you to boarding school [Woodycrest, Bronx, New York].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where had you gone to school before that, where did you go to first grade (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was gonna, I was in public school you know, I went to P.S. 48 [P.S. 48, William Wordsworth School, Jamaica, New York], which is in Queens, still there, and 154th Street, 155th Street actually.
Speaker 1: Did you have any teachers that influenced you at P.S.--
Speaker 2: Oh, man I've always had teachers--
Speaker 1: I mean in that, at, at that particular school?
Speaker 2: At that particular school yes Miss Gayle was the teacher that I, I think of right, right off the bat because she was, she was jet black and smooth and fine.  And oh she was so fine to me, I just thought she was so fine, I mean I, she was like my fifth grade teacher.  And I was, I had a crush on her, I mean she could tell me to bring, to bring two or three boxes down to her car.  And I would fe- I'd feel like that was a heavenly kind of thing to do.  I mean she, she liked me.  I was a good kid, and I really just dug her, so Miss Gayle was the first person, well I had, my first teacher my first grade teacher name was named Miss Davis.  Of course I remember that because we had the same name, and she was a white lady, but she was very nice.  She was a very nice, big white woman I'll never forget, and named Miss Davis.  Then my, my fourth grade teacher I don't know what happened to my third-grade teacher, oh my third-grade teacher was Miss Lennon [ph.], I remember her, she was mean.  My fourth grade teacher was Miss Finch [ph.], and she was nice, but the teacher that I really liked a lot was Miss Gayle.  And I think she was my very first black teacher, and she was just perfect, she didn't let you get away with nothing, she was straightforward.  And I liked her as a person, and, and she was just, she was just real cool.  I remember seeing her about ten years later.  I think I may have been out of high school [Haaren High School, New York, New York] by then and everything.  And she had a touch of gray in her hair and I just aw, she just melted my heart, I mean I still wanted to, to deal with her.  But in, I'm sure there are millions of fascinations with teachers all over the world, billions probably, so that's not unusual.  But she was a person that while I was in Queens I can't think of any--I mean I was a little kid my mother got, I had Frankie [ph.] when I was like first, second grade.  Frankie was a guardian that my mother had gotten for me, she felt you know I needed somebody to come pick me up from school when I got out, so I was little kid.  So I had this, this guy named Frankie who had nice thick wavy hair, was a brown skinned kid, very good-looking kid and man we always had a bunch of women around us, so always.  'Cause he was handsome, I was cute and, and Frankie, matter of fact Frankie was with me when I got my dimple.  Because what happened is my cousin was swinging on a swing and she told me not to walk behind her, and I did anyway and the swing hit me right in the face.  And I got a dimple forever on my right side and I remember Frankie was the one that took me up to the principal's office 'cause as everybody was thinking about going to the hospital you know 'cause I was a little bloody.  And then I'm a little kid, and I just got knocked out by a swing I mean but went to the principal's office and the principal said, "Oh, it's okay we don't have to take him to the hospital.  Put a little peroxide on it, he'll be all right and he's gonna have a dimple."  And I remember Frankie was there, he says, "Wow this is gonna make you look even cuter."  (Laughter) But Frankie was cool.  Frankie was, he was like I mean I wish I could invent a Frankie for every young boy that I see on the street 'cause he was my guardian.  And my mother hooked him up, she was at work she said I'm, I want him picked up and.  I mean I don't know what arrangements they had but Frankie was always around.  And then, and then when I got older, well the only other person that I had that was like looking out was Miss Gayle, I mean she was my fifth grade teacher.  She was very good, she was friends with my mother, but then I went to boarding school and everything changed.

Speaker 1: From that--
Speaker 2: Before you went to boarding school [Woodycrest, Bronx, New York] though when you were still living in Queens [New York] at home with your mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] and father [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis], what kind of music did they, they play in the house then?
Speaker 1: Oh they play you know Fats Waller, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke [Duke Ellington], Count [Count Basie], a lot of gospel, Mahalia Jackson, oh the Five, the Five Blind Boys from Mississippi [Five Blind Boys of Mississippi].  I mean you know and my mother would sing sometimes with the music and sometimes without the music she'd sing.  Daddy Joe never sang.  But, but we all like the music, all the hip R&B music, when the Twist came out we were all twisting in the house you know.  The Mashed Potatoes you know they, whatever new dance that the kids were doing that I knew, I would have to put it on, put on, show my mother you know she'd try to do it you know.  Daddy Joe he didn't participate in stuff like that.

Speaker 1: What about Christmases and--?
Speaker 2: Christmases were special Christmas was very, very special, very, very special.  The tree, the presents, the surprise presents you know, and you know you don't know exactly what you gonna get but you hope you gonna get what you wish for, whatever.  And then my mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] could cook up a storm, she was a major cook so we knew we gonna eat wonderfully I mean this, that was gonna be without question.  And I knew I was gonna see my brothers and sisters, I knew that we were gonna have family time.  Christmas was always special always very, very special. It was the time for the family to get together, time for me to see my real mother [Mattie Robinson Dawson] and my brothers and sisters.  And share presents and, and then me and my brothers, no, well at least Clarence [Clarence Dawson], well his name is Rahim [Rahim Dawson], we would wrestle or something, fight, breakup something.  'Cause you know we, still, even though we were raised separately we still had our sibling rivalry.  And yeah but Christmas, all the holidays but especially Christmas.  The most memorable Christmas for me was when I got my 3-speed English racer; it was gold the only gold bike in the shop.  And of course I'm the, I'm just a kid so if I say a gold bike I'm not thinking you can take any of these bikes and make them gold (laughter). But to me that just seem like it was gold, pure gold, I just had to have it.  And my mother said, "I don't know it's kind of expensive, we'll see."  And then when Christmas came, and I went under the tree, looked under the tree and it was no bike.  And, and I was hurt, I had, I felt so bad 'cause my mother had never ever, ever let me down, anything I wished for I got.  Even if it was done on the down low, she would get it for me, and now the bike, she knows I wanted this bike, I was eleven.  I had to have the bike and it wasn't there, and then she had the nerve to tell me out of her bedroom she says, "I got some things I want to pick up there at Miss Bright's [ph.] house."  Miss Bright was a tenant of ours we had a house in Queens [New York], a second house after we moved from 156th Street was, the second house was bigger.  And my mother had won it, she had gotten the house by playing the numbers, she hit the, she hit, she won twenty-five thousand dollars back in 1954 and bought a house with a lot of land.  And all of my life I thought that the house was, that the deed was Daddy Joe's [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis].  And when he died first, and then when she was about ready to check out I had to of course deal with all of the paperwork, and she says, "Make sure you got the deeds in a safe place."  So I looked at the deeds, and her name was on everything and I said, "Your name is on everything."  She says, "So you thought this was Joe's house, huh?"  She says no I bought this house with my money that I earned from hitting the numbers.  But you know what, those are lessons my mother taught me that I would always will remember, she never had to step up and say I did it, this is me.  She'd give Daddy Joe his, his ego, and every man has one, everybody, every person does, but men feed off their egos, their basic raw ego's more than women do in that regard.  Women have a lot of other cosmetic things they can do.

Speaker 1: He would make like every Labor Day and every, every Fourth of July--you didn't have to know where I live; you could smell the barbecue.  If you came to any section in Queens [New York] you could and follow your nose, you'd be at my house and my father [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] would actually go down and get a pig.  I would have to take care of, and then we'd kill it, scald it, scrape it, split it, barbecue it, yeah.  I mean I was raised like a, a farmer.
Speaker 2: Like a country kid, right?
Speaker 1: Like a country kid.  And, and so we had I mean it was, it was we had these fabulous, fabulous gatherings, potato salad, collard greens and cornbread and barbecue chicken, barbecue ribs and we had, we have made a horseshoe grill, a horseshoe barbecue pit, not a grill, a horseshoe barbecue pit.
Speaker 2: You dug a hole in the ground?
Speaker 1: No, we had, we didn't, we built it, we made a cement horseshoe barbecue pit like this high off the floor at least.  I mean we stand over top of it and you got your, and it was shaped in a horseshoe thing and you got your grill you could put two pigs on that bad boy.  I mean it was like that, it was serious, it was real, real serious. And, and we even took a, a my father took a piece of the grapevine that was in front of the garage and put it in this other yard that we had on the property.  And made another grapevine which was really you know a great thrill for me, 'cause I'm the one that picks the grapes and from the grapes we made the wine.  And we, so have the police officers loved us, the milkman loved us the insurance man loved us, the mailman loved us.  Because they knew when you came around this time of year you got a gallon of wine. Because by now December 13, it's ready because the wine, we made the wine in August and you let it ferment, and between August and December that bad boy is getting ready.  And then you start giving out the gallons to the mailman, to this, please, we could do anything we wanted to do. I mean it was like that Daddy Joe, he brought all that southern attitude up here, and I hated it to some extent. But when I look back on it I was, I was a prince; I mean I had a lot of stuff going on.
Story_ID: 364381
Speaker 1: And the fact that he [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] told me I had to work made it, made it really rich because working has been the saving grace in my life (laughter).  If I didn't know how to work I would've been in a lot of trouble, 'cause I'd have to break, you know I mean I, I break down, I don't ask my kids to do jack.  I mean every now and then I will ask them to do something because it's just out of respect.  But like if that dishes are dirty in the sink, I'm not gonna complain, I will wash them.  If something needs to be mopped, I will wash it; I'm not complaining I'm not saying, and I'm not nagging. 'Cause that's one thing I did hear my folks do a lot.  I did hear Daddy Joe nag and so forth.  And I told myself when I got grown, I am not gonna be a nagger, I'm not going to be a nagger.  But if you're not going to be a nagger, that means you're gonna be a doer, 'cause this shit's gotta be done.  And if you, and if you got kids, and people around that should be doing and then not doing it then yeah and you're not gonna get on them about it, then you better do it.  And I, and again power of an example has been a moving force because I'll get it put in, I don't say nothing to nobody.  And I start cleaning and cooking and doing all kinds of things, you better find something to do, and if you don't, that's cool too.  I'm not saying nothing to you I'm gonna let your guilty conscience work with you, I'm not trying to tell you how to do things.  You see me do stuff all the time, so it ain't like a big mystery, so really if you really wanna be human you know jump on this train.  But like yeah I, so we had, we had all kinds of, we had fantastic gatherings.
Story_ID: 364382
Speaker 1: Who would you say it was that taught you, you know the lessons about what it means, well what this society will tell you it means to be black?  To be a black kid, to be a--like when did you become aware of like people are gonna discriminate against you solely based on the color of your skin (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that--again Daddy Joe [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] and mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] kind of help me bypass a lot of that stuff because simple reason I, they were older when they got me, they were in their forties when they married.  So I was very lucky. I couldn't watch Sammy Davis, Jr. on TV because, and I just found out he was born the same day as my father Daddy Joe, the 8th of December.  I couldn't watch him because he was married to a white woman, and he was also a Jew.  And Daddy Joe said, "He's a, he's a doubly stupid nigger, he marries a white woman and he's a Jew, he don't want to be black, so turn off the TV.  Stepin Fetchit, rolls eyes, shuffle his feet, scratch his head, turn him off, he's a Tom, we don't need to watch that," you know.  I mean, I would watch it anyway because that was you know once again when you tell people not to do something, you want to do it, so I would always wanna.  And then I even realized the formula for 'The Ed Sullivan Show' that you don't have to watch all of 'The Ed Sullivan Show,' that's a waste of time.  You just watch the last fifteen minutes, 'cause if there's some black people on there, they gonna be on the last fifteen minutes.  And, because that was the highlight of the entertainment, they always save the best for last.  So yeah he, he was clear about how black people were treated, how black people had been treated, all the lynchings.  I mean I heard all the stories, and then my mother worked for white people, people at Great Neck [New York] and, and white people liked me, I mean they thought I was great.  They thought I was charming, I remember one time my mother came to me when I was at Great Neck and she says, "Myrna [ph.] likes you."  And Myrna was the, the so-called little cute white girl in the neighborhood, in the Great Neck, or in Great Neck, Long Island [New York].  And I said, "Ew, I hate her," and that evening I heard my mother and father talking and, because they were always talk about me.  She said, "Well we ain't got to a worry about Charles [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole] and them white girls 'cause he sure don't like Myrna, and all those boys up there think she real cute."  I ain't find Myrna cute, I ain't I, I ain't have none of that.  So I think I got that almost through osmosis because they were both hard-working black people, and then they would and in terms of the complexions, they were chocolate.  You know, we, so we're now talking about you know I mean I guess I was considered almost light skinned and being their child, being their kid 'cause they were chocolate, they were very much chocolate.  And workers, I can't emphasize that enough.
Story_ID: 364383
Speaker 1: Were there--were they [Oyewole's maternal aunt and uncle, Elvenia Robinson Davis and Joseph Davis] involved in local politics?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  The only thing that they were involved in was the church, and the church was here in Harlem [New York, New York].  They had, so that was another journey for me every Sunday morning we would get in the car, had a routine I have to--before I got my clothes on, I have to go down, 'cause Daddy Joe always had a Pontiac and he, and early on he used to have whitewall tires.  And I have to get the Brillo and clean the whitewall tires because we getting ready to ride into Harlem and we got to look good.  And he had a, a turquoise and white Pontiac, with whitewall tires.  And I hated the fact that before I could put on my church clothes I had to be out there and get the tires clean, but that was part of my job.  And we would make that journey into New York [New York], into Harlem and this was ooh, this was the place where I, I fell in love with Harlem when I was a kid.
Speaker 1: What was it about Harlem--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --as a kid that you fell in love with, as a kid though?
Speaker 2: As a kid it was like to see black people standing on the corner in cashmere coats and fedora hats, looking like they owned the block.  You didn't see no bums, you didn't see no homeless people, you didn't see none of that.  It was like smooth, cool looking brothers hanging, standing on the corner or standing on the street, walking the street, look.  And then the little girls playing hopscotch, jumping double-dutch and their little booties just jumping around and they looked like just life, total life.  And I would, because I'd be standing outside my aunt's apartment building on 142nd Street when they started talking about me, I had to go sit outside.  And then I watch the, and the kids in the neighborhood and they play hopscotch, and jump double-dutch and girls were cute and just vibrant.  I mean Harlem was oh man (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How was it different from Queens, Jamaica [New York]?
Speaker 2: It was a community where it was everybody seemed to be outside you know what I mean.  Or there was a whole lot of activities going on amongst the different, a bunch of different people outside.  Queens was, you know you got your home, you got your house, you're a homeowner there's no activity on the street.  You know, you everything is inside, only time I had any activity, I go to the park you know and I play handball a lot, and see my friends, something like that.  When I got in basketball you know same thing, go to the park, but there was no just gathering on the corner, or gathering outside on the street.  Not in your neighborhood, not when you got a house that was totally out, you didn't have that behavior.  But in Harlem man, folks is standing out on the corner you know and everybody looked cool; I didn't know if folks didn't have money to pay rent, I didn't know what was.  All I know is everybody looked good, and no everybody looked strong, nobody look weak downtrodden.  And I wanted that, I wanted that so bad so going from 108th Street, our church is 108th Street between Central Park and Manhattan Avenue.  And then we would travel up 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] to Aunt Baby's house, and sometimes we would just take 7th Avenue sometimes we'd take Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard] but we'd travel uptown to 142nd Street, Lenox.   Aunt Baby, that was Daddy Joe's sister and she'd always have the same thing.  Greens, cornbread, chicken and, and rice and she wasn't no great cook but you know it was, what she may was good, it was fine.  And we would pass sometimes the Theresa Hotel [Hotel Theresa, New York, New York] and I would see all these people gathering around this tall dude he looked like he was orange to me.  And I finally learned he was Malcolm [Malcolm X] talking to the people, and I used to think Malcolm was ten feet tall I didn't know he was standing on a ladder. He was standing on a, a stepladder, I couldn't see the stepladder from--first of all, another expression children should be seen and not heard.  So I didn't have any running conversations with my parents about anything, because I was a kid.  My aunt was in the car with us and she only would say once she said, "That man over there, he's telling the truth, they gonna kill him."  And I used to, and, and that, line will always be in my head because of the fact that, if I didn't tell the truth, I was gonna get a ass whipping and a half.  And here's this man telling the truth, according to what I'm hearing my, my parents say, and they're gonna kill him, and they sure enough did.  Before I got out of high school [Haaren High School, New York, New York] they killed Malcolm in 1965.  So it was, it was weird to me, I mean but Harlem had so much strength, they was such a vibration on the street.  It just felt like you have come to a place of black class, black sophistication, black arrogance.  You know a black power is here you can feel it, you know we own everything, we own the actual dirt on the sidewalk, we own everything.  So I just, I was totally enchanted with Harlem and then to see those girls I'm sure there was another chapter 'cause they can, they had the little bodies and they jumping around and jump double-dutch.  And you didn't see nobody jumping double-dutch unless you went to the park, you might see some girls taking rope but this was on the sidewalk you know.  And he got that rhythm going and you be getting, I mean I just became enchanted with the rhythm and, and the style of the people, it was a certain kind of an aura that this neighborhood that this particular place, that Harlem had.  That I wanted to have, I wanted that.
Story_ID: 364384
Speaker 1: What was the church itself like?
Speaker 2: Southern Baptist Church [New York, New York], of course down south that's a problem.  They don't--the black church hate the Southern Baptists, but up here Southern Baptist is all black.  Reverend C.W. Wilson [sic. C.B. Wilson] was the pastor, it was fabulous it was social very social of course it's a social club anywhere basically.  I got a chance to, to I sang in the choir a little bit you know I had a couple of little girlfriends.  The park was right across the street so you know you take off go to the park and smooch and stuff, Central Park [New York, New York] was right across.  This church is in the block on 108th Street, between Central Park West and, and Manhattan [Manhattan Avenue].  And I was baptized in the church when I was ten and I remember I was baptized in the church in the evening.  And that same evening my mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] had planned for us to as part of the baptism thing to go to see the Gospel Caravan at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York], right after that.  And it was, the baptism was a riot too, 'cause this was just before I went to boarding school [Woodycrest, Bronx, New York].  I was still at home and my mother felt it was time for me to be baptized and they have a whole ceremony you know it's a Baptist church.  Got on the white gown.
Speaker 1: Did you have to go and get on the mourner's bench and?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Did you have to you know do the whole revival thing where you go get on the mourner's bench and then you stand up and (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No the Baptists, in the Baptist church they do a little different I mean all I remember was that we came from let's see we were already--the, the pool where they baptize you was in the basement of the, of the church, probably still is there, I imagine, because the church is still there.  And they would, once they put you, have your white gown on, I don't know if I was upstairs coming downstairs, I was downstairs, I was walking, walking towards, towards the pool you know they say, (singing) "Take me to the water," ['Take Me to the Water']. So that whole moment is very, very somber in that regard. (Singing) "Take me to the water, take me to the water to be baptized."  And everybody is standing around, I mean this like a major holy moment 'cause everybody's watching, my father [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] had said, "That boy ain't ready to be baptized, he got the devil him."  He had been saying that to my mother before this, before my mo- my mother was always very positive about me she would--she would not always listen to Daddy Joe.  Anyway when Reverend Wilson held me in his arms and said in the name of the Father, (makes sounds) name of the Son, (makes sounds) and the name of the Holy Ghost and they keep you down there longer than they do on the first two downs.  And I didn't know anything about swimming and water was getting my nose, my mouth and I'm kicking, I'm fighting and my father looked at mom and said, "What I tell you that's the devil in that boy."  My mother said, "I don't care what you say, we're going to the Gospel Caravan after this and, and he's baptized, and that's what I wanted."  But he swore see, and I knew later on that it was a case that I just didn't know how to hold my breath 'cause if I had known how to hold my breath, then that would never have happened but I had never, I had not learned how to swim by that time.
Story_ID: 364385
Speaker 1: But we did go to the Gospel Caravan at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] which I'll never forget and I saw Dorothy Norwood, Norwood sing. I saw everybody.  Shirley Caesar who even today is still singing and I was a baby then I was a kid, she was rocking them.  I mean and I'll never forget that particular experience, because it was the night that I got baptized and a guy was so happy in the balcony of the Apollo.  He shouted himself right off the damn balcony on to the mezzanine.  He didn't die, he broke a lady's arm who was in the chair below, but he was okay.  And it was, I, and I knew he was gonna fall because he was just jumping, jumping, jumping right real close to the edge.  And I knew I said this guy is gonna fall right over the thing, he sure did.  Right in the Apollo I'll never forget that, that was--
Speaker 2: But he broke the woman's arm underneath?
Speaker 1: He broke the woman's arm he landed on yeah you he landed on the woman; the woman couldn't get out the way.  I mean obviously everybody's in seats and it was good that--
Speaker 2: That she broke the fall (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: But you're, go ahead, you were saying you would never forget it--
Speaker 1: No I would never forget it because it was all, it was big events in my life you know and then that he had that happened and Daddy Joe [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] thought that was funny as hell, so he laughed about it.  Mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] didn't think it was funny she said Joe the man could have been seriously hurt he said yeah but the Lord should've saved him you know.  Because Daddy Joe believed in the Lord but he has doubts about what the Lord could do.
Speaker 2: Why did he have his doubts?
Speaker 1: Well because he was, he believed in work and he thought that a lot of people prayed and walked around and wished for stuff.  And he had no patience with wishes.  His whole thing was if you really want something you have to go after it, you've got to work for it you ain't no wisher.  And he didn't, he didn't believe, if Daddy Joe had dreams, I mean I think he was an anti-dreamer.
Story_ID: 364386
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you believe you were changed after the Holy Ghost dip?
Speaker 2: No he didn't believe I would change.
Speaker 1: Did you believe you had changed?
Speaker 2: Did I believe that I changed?
Speaker 1: Yeah, did you believe that God had changed (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I tried to change, I thought I was gonna be better or good, and I wasn't never really bad but it didn't do nothing for me, it didn't make me change.  That was, I, when I look back on that that was all my mother's [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] wishes that was just stuff to make her feel good yeah.  It didn't have, I don't remember any real effect it having on me, only thing I remember was that I needed to know how to swim.  I mean it affected me like that, which I am a good swimmer today you know which is good.  But at that time, I did not know how to swim so when they said, "In the name of the Holy Ghost" and hold down a little longer than they do when they say in the name of the Father and Son I was jacked up.  'Cause I couldn't hold my breath, I couldn't, it could've been a smooth baptism if I had known how to hold.  If somebody had told me now when we put you down the third time just hold your breath, like do like this and hold your breath.  I didn't do that, I was putting everything in God's hands, not realizing that God helps those who help themselves and we have this  misconstrued understanding of God and it's been carrying over forever.  And consequently a lot of people are gonna die of depression not realizing that they held the keys to their own salvation.  I mean I've learned that now and it's--but it that learning of that makes everything more responsible.  Nothing you can, you can't and, and like it's like if something bad happens, you know instead of saying why me? You have to recognize why not, why not you?  You're here you know (laughter) you can; you can catch a disease like anybody else.  You can get hit, you can get hurt, catch a cold, have an abscess you know. It, it so the, the question is not why me, why not you, you know?  And you have to, and that, but that's the first statement of acceptance and once you learn how to accept it's never as bad as it appears.  I don't care what it is, if you accept it, but you have to accept it.  You can't deny so, that, that's.  No, I didn't feel any difference, I used to close my eyes before my mother even would at, my mother would stop going to Southern Baptist Church [New York, New York] some years later.  She started trying to get, I guess she was seeking a, a strong relationship with God and so she went back to where she knew which was a Pentecostal church which she had known when she was in Ohio.  And she was looking for that in Queens [New York], we found a place called Friendly [Friendly Church of the Apostolic Faith, New York, New York] and it was a storefront and the church was jumping.  Everything was rocking I mean you go there and just be rocking, rocking folks just be singing and tambourines be banging.  And I remember I used to go with my mother, Daddy Joe [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] didn't to the church he didn't like it, he didn't go.  And mother, I would close my eyes and wish for the Holy Ghost to get me I close my eyes and want this thing to grab me.  Because if it grabbed Sister Lacey [ph.] and she's was three hundred pounds, she's dancing on one foot.  She's happy she's talking in tongues I mean and then somebody else and every now and then my mother would catch it as she (makes sound) say something weird and I said Lord I wanna get that, and I close my eyes.  Nothing ever happened, I never, never got it.
Story_ID: 364566
Speaker 1: So you were talking about the women in the church.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah church has always been, was always a fas- fascination because of the women for me and it's true today.  I mean matter-of-fact, known brothers, if you mention some brothers who were looking for a mate somebody said, "Well you should go to church, 'cause they all there."  And women have always packed the churches, I mean the pastor wouldn't be nothing if it wasn't for his female congregation, I mean bottom line.  So I've always enjoyed that, and there's a certain sensuality when the women gets the spirit and they start to shout, and they start to, to get into their, that spiritual space that, that's a turn-on to me.  I really get excited, and I find that, that same excitement that I got when I was a kid going to church looking at the sister shouting and singing and doing all the stuff they did.  I got the same thrill when I watched the African dancers in an African dance group, same thing.  I get the same excitement like ooh, but they, but they're on stage dancing, they're African dancing.  And sometimes they're not wearing even a lot of clothes so it's a different thing but that, that fits really I guess it's the emoting of that female energy, that just turns me on.  I mean I, I just, I just, I, I love women I mean I'm just, you know it's based on what you have already heard.  I mean it's like I got some of my [maternal] grandfather [Charles Robinson] in me.  And, and women loved me, I mean so it's a match you know it ain't like you know it's, it's one thing when you love something but it doesn't love you back.  But I never had the problem, matter of fact I've had maybe the reverse of that problem where I've had you know too many women and I--and then I'm, and I'm not, and I'm very affectionate, but I'm not affectionate in public, you know.
Speaker 1: And why is that?
Speaker 2: 'Cause I really think that it's a personal thing and that, you know how you, you know kissing and hugging and all that stuff, I don't really think it's something for public ex- exhibition.  I'm really, I'm real private, I'm real public but I'm real private.  I'm public with everything else but when it comes to my personal intimate relationships, I would never film it.  I would never want nobody to see me doing nothing to nobody.  I would never want to participate in some kind of group act, activity.  I, I think sex is sacred, I think it's holy and I actually believe you can do just about anything you wanna do behind closed doors with agreement with the person that you're with.  And if and, if you wanna, I mean even the homo thing, I mean I don't care what, a person wants to be gay, they wanna screw each other's earlobes off that's your business.  Do whatever you feel like doing, but why do I have to be notified? (Laughter) Why are you said dude, ding, ding we want you to watch us fucking.  I don't wanna watch you fucking, and I think it's silly that we have a society, a whole country; this country is number one when it comes to pornography.  It produces more pornography than all of your other three countries that produce pornography, Holland [the Netherlands], and, and Germany and Austria cannot touch one company in America (laughter).  I mean and they got a whole bunch of pornography over there too but the bottom line is that this place has made it like a religion it's a substitute for God.  And I can't for the life of me in all the years that I have seen and I've got sons and I got friends who actually go and watch girls strip you know.  And I, I don't understand for the, I don't get it, I really don't get it, it doesn't do nothing for me.  But if I see a sister shouting in church, excites me, I see a sister doing some African dance on stage, I'm excited.  I see and you know I mean there are so many things I can see sisters doing that really turn me on.  But watching a sister strip to turn me on, showing me her titties or her pussy and her ass, I mean if, if it's a private strip, I'm down.  But if it's a public strip I think it's  distasteful, I don't like that you know, and I have a real issue.  So what I do because I'm around people and I like people and I know that a lot of the young men like that sort of thing, I just don't participate you know.  I mean I've been asked by my kids different tie, times different situation will you hangout, nope I don't like that.  I don't like that. I just, I think it's a waste.

Speaker 1: And I can get freaky and I obviously I must be okay because I have not dealt with a woman yet who I haven't had to have beat the hell out of me, out of my life like please it's over, bye, it's finished.  Don't; let's not even try to keep this going on, cause once women and, and me my son you just met talked about that.  Once they, they break that, you break that little mold of I ma- you woman, then you realize a woman becomes a beast, she's a beast.  She wants, if she decides she likes you and you like, she likes what you do she wants you to do it all the time, and she's gonna bug you until you do it all the time, she's going to bug you out and that is a trip to me.  Because I'm saying look I, I'm bringing to you some gifts, and you bringing me some gifts we are sharing, I'm satisfied, you're satisfied.  Next time you know, but naw, here's the phone ringing, I mean it's a trip.  Because women, women are it's like back to another expression man chases woman 'til she catches him.  So I've learned that, I've learned that women are really out there with nets and traps and they, and we think we're, we're setting something off.  And they just waiting for you to step your foot right in the trap, step right in that net, and let me yoke you up, hook you up.  And, but I, I always, I think my, one, one of the things that I have always gotten from women that I do, I mean I've gotten some wisdom from some brothers too.  But I get my wisdom from women and I guess, that's because maybe that's all they have to work with because they don't have the brawn.  So I've been fortunate to have a lot of women in my life give me information, give me green lights, give me a vote of confidence to do what I'm doing today.  So I've been very fortunate, very blessed and, and as I say you know I like women, women like me.  So that's been, and I and they've been some of my, my greatest allies you know, if I need financial help.  I know that at least two or three dozen women I can call they, they would run to give me help.  And the reason I don't even play that hand is because they're so willing and when you get that kind of, if you get some financial help that's deep enough.  Well then that's, you got to pay it back and then a lot of times the payback is much more than just the money, so I try to stay clear of that.  And I do have some people I can deal with like that and they're not gonna put no extra weight on me.  But there are some people who you know I gave you a thousand dollars and you know at least you can do is come over and have dinner with me, or whatever. Oh, god, you know, so--
Story_ID: 364568
Speaker 1: Going back to when you were ten years old and you were baptized what did you--what were your dreams of doing with your life, at that time?  What had you been exposed to that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I was supposed to be a doctor, I was gonna be a doctor matter-of-fact some of the people in the neighborhood called me Doc as a, a precursor to my future.  Yeah I was, I was studying to be a doctor, I had no idea that I had poetic stuff happen, I'd sing a lot, my mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] whenever she heard something on the radio that she knew I knew she'd call me in to sing it.  Sometimes if they were neighbors, call them in to listen and so I did a lot of singing.  I thought I would do some singing, I didn't think I'd be a singer 'cause I didn't have that as a desire.  Even though I admired Nat King Cole and Johnny Mathis above and beyond, I used to imitate them all the time.  And, and I won a lot of talent shows matter-of-fact imitating Johnny Mathis singing 'Misty' 'and all that stuff yeah.  I mean I thought his voice was just perfect, and I still think it is.  I think he's one of the greatest singers America has produced and, and, I think America thinks that too I mean time has proven that.  Now medicine was something that enchanted me.  I don't know, well you know I think it was just the fact that I wanted to heal somebody.  I wanted to help, I wanted to, I wanted to be a healer, I wanted to be some--and the doctor was the closest thing that I could think of.  And I was a good student, I was a good science student and I had a lot of reasons too, I mean I think that well, I was, I was a good student.  And I was, I was, I don't know I had a lot of other stuff happening too with sports and stuff like that.  But as far as what people knew about what I was gonna do like being a doctor was at the top of the list.

Speaker 1: When I was ten, again and this was the Easter, probably right after I got baptized, there was the Easter show at the same church, Southern Baptist Church [New York, New York].  And my mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] had put my name down on the list to recite the Lord's Prayer, and so I was going to participate.  This was my first time participating in this big Easter extravaganza that they had at the church.  When we got to our house in Queens [New York], my mother had me standing, standing downstairs in the basement of our house and she said, "I want you to recite the Lord's Prayer.  And I want you here, I want to hear you upstairs in the kitchen."  I'm ten years old what is she talking about?  I'm in the basement of our house and she wants me to do the Lord's Prayer and she was to hear me so I said, "Our Father--."  She said, "If you yell the name of the Lord again I'll come down there and I'm a beat your butt, don't you, don't you be disrespectful.  Throw your voice; project your voice from your stomach, project I want to hear you clear, I want to hear you loud and clear.  And you better not yell."  This was when I was ten, and I know to this day that's one of the, that's, that's like that's probably the biggest brick in my foundation of who I am.  And I, and, and when that Easter Sunday came Reverend Wilson [C.B. Wilson] put that microphone in front of me and my mother was up like flash she said, "He don't need no mic, he does not."  Even, like of course the church: "Amen, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, amen."  "Our Father--."  People bothered me about that in Harlem [New York, New York] for the next twenty years of my life.  If I was to run into somebody now who was there that Easter Sunday they'd say yeah you Joe Davis' [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] boy, you did the Lord's Prayer I'll never forget that boy.  And I had no idea that I was setting myself up for using my mouth for the rest of my life, no idea.  I was only ten but I did the Lord's Prayer obviously the way my mother wanted me to do it.  And it stuck in the minds, I mean the Lord's Prayer is something that everybody does, they do it before they go to sleep, they do this when they get up, you would, what would make you so special that, that this little kid did the Lord's Prayer?  It was special, it was extremely special, it was the most special thing I ever did until started The Last Poets.  And as on and I make no commentary or nothing I just simply recited the Lord's Prayer.  And I got more play than people get played on the star shows and all that stuff.  I mean I couldn't go anyplace in that church after that where people did not stop me and say, "Boy that was something special."  And this would be years later man that was something, like there was no other Easter, there was nothing else, there was never another Easter.  There was never another Easter Sunday extravaganza; none of that it was just that one Easter Sunday when, when the Davis boy [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole] recited the Lord's Prayer.

Speaker 1: So what do you, let's move to the point where your, your mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] says okay you got to go to boarding school [Woodycrest, Bronx, New York]--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you lost the ring, and they had to fight and, or no was it the car, the car was--
Speaker 2: Oh the car was the thing that was one of the, the, the straws that broke the camel's back so to speak.  But it was also the question of the fact that Daddy Joe [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] didn't respect education, mother did.  Daddy Joe went to third grade, he didn't, he thought that people educated themselves into oblivion.  He didn't think that, that you needed to go to all school for, he just didn't think that was necessary to work and make a living.  Or you need--first you needed have a willingness to do something and then you need to do it, that was basically what he was coming from.  And his whole thing was as far as he was concerned everybody had the ability to be self-taught and if you couldn't teach yourself something, then you stupid.  And you need to go some, to a clinic to get help, 'cause he taught everything and he knew he taught to himself.  And I've seen him talking to other people who he got information from but he could apply it you know.  And his, his thing was being an applicator you know right away.  Forget about this of I'm studying theory you know; he had no respect for that, none at all.  Matter of fact he used to make the statement he says, "Yeah boy," he says, "you should go to college little faggots go, that's what they do."  And I said, "I'm not gonna be a faggot."  You know 'cause you know there was some softness, I always have some softness.  Because of my mother as she, and now I catered to her and she catered to me I mean and I wanted to be around her.  I, I'd rather wash the dishes than take out the damn generator of that car you know, and said, "Boy get out the house, get out the house right now."  We couldn't, if we were sitting around talking and laughing, "What's, what's funny what y'all laughing about?"  I mean it was like that, so we couldn't even laugh around him it was like 'cause that's wasting time, you're not doing anything.  You're laughing, you're sitting around talking and laughing, what are you doing?  So my mother put all those pieces together and she realized that my development was gonna be curtailed if I didn't get out of there.  I hated Daddy Joe, I didn't love him you know 'cause he was mean.  I mean I've learned to love him after his, I learned to let him towards his, the last part of his life.  And then definitely after he died but he was fear to me, he was fear, I, I was afraid of the man, I never, I was not afraid of anybody.  When he died, all my fears died I mean Daddy Joe was serious, he was, he was from Georgia, he was a big man, he was strong.  I watched him throw a tenant of ours out of the basement, he threw him up the stairs, and I ain't never seen nobody thrown up no stairs before.  I'm a kid watching this, and I'm knowing that that's my father, I'm definitely not messing with him.  This man is beyond strength, I mean this was after my mother had passed the message on to my father.  Said, I told Mr. Kenneth what you said, Mr. Kenneth, I went down and I said, "Mr. Kenneth, Joe told me to ask you for the rent money."  And Mr. Kenneth said, "You tell your husband to kiss my ass," and so she said, "I will tell him," and that's exactly what she did when he came off of work.  She says, "I told Mr. Kenneth what you said.  He told me to tell you to kiss his ass," and Daddy Joe said, "He did?"  He took off his stuff and went in the house, and he went directly downstairs and I was, he told me not to come downstairs.  And he went down there and I heard a bunch of boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and the next thing I see--Mr. Kenneth who was bigger than my father or about the same size flying up the stairs from the basement.  And all his shit, suitcases, loose clothes and the man was like screaming and man you told me if, you ain't got no due process and blah, blah, blah, blah, I'm going to call the police. Well, and like a fool he called the police and what would the, what would a police gonna do at Joe Davis' house and they drinking his wine every day?  I mean, the man had no idea Daddy Joe had covered all his tracks; you can't get my father in trouble, not in this neighborhood [in Queens, New York].  And the cops said well if Joe Davis don't want you in his house no more I think you gonna leave, and we'll help you pick up your stuff, take you to the precinct, we don't have another place to take you, you know.  But you can't stay here, everything all right Joe (laughter), he said man took me out, broke my stuff, he, da, da, da, he beat me up, he busted my mouth, he broke my tooth he, he did this.  He said well you must've made him mad, that was Daddy Joe.  And so and I would get, when I got whippings they were without my clothes, he would say you know I'm not gone tear anything I paid for.  So I would go downstairs in the basement which was the same place where I did the Lord's Prayer, take off all my clothes and he would have a strap in the closet where he would tear my butt up.  And one time he let me know that he had some humility 'cause you know I was trying to get away from strap and I backed into the furnace, into the hot water pipe.  And my whole back just had a big black mark on it now, it was singed and he heard the scream.  And he knew it wasn't from the beating and he threw that strap down, picked me up, took me upstairs.  And him and my mother played Florence Nightingale on my back all night, they hooked me up.  But he was a strict man, very, very strict, but me being a kid, being spoiled by my mother, being loved by everybody else around me and all that stuff, I didn't have any time for that stuff.  I, I wanted that man dead, I wanted him gone; I wanted him out of my life.  I mean he was not happiness I, I wasn't gonna make it with him, just wasn't gonna make it.
Story_ID: 364571
Speaker 1: My mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] saw that and put me in Woodycrest, which was a boarding school up in the Bronx [New York].  Where I had a chance to change my name, I became Chucky [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole], Charles, because there was a white boy named Charles and I didn't want to be called the same he was called.  So I said well they don't call me Charles they call me Chuck and my mother came to the school looking for me and she was asking for Charles and everybody is--and then they said oh you talking about Chucky.  The first thing she said was why did you change your name, I said I just didn't want to be called Charles she says okay.  She says you know well I'm never calling you Chucky says you gone always be Charles, I said I know.  And then my later on I changed got into my African thing, I guess that'll be in the next set of tapes.  But, but yeah that was, Woodycrest was perfect because I had a chance to mingle with guys my age, I had a chance to really, I had a chance to discover how strong I was.  'Cause I had no idea I was, I was strong I, I mean I knew I could handle myself, I knew I could fight.  I didn't, I had one fight and beat the guy almost unmercifully but I didn't know what regular horseplay.  I didn't know for example you grabbed me around my neck; that I could take you and fling you into the wall, that's how strong I was.  So, and that's the first thing when you're a little kid that's the first thing kids do grab someone around the neck.  When you hold me like that, you just set yourself up but nothing but trouble.  'Cause I'm gone take you and ram you into the wall while you're on my neck.  And I did that shit so often, Mr. Enderly [ph.], the director he says, "You know what Charles, Chucky you're not gone to be able to play with the other kids.  You don't, you don't know how to play.  You're hurting people."  And I said, "What you mean I'm hurting people?"  "You flung someone in the wall, he, he cracked his tooth he did this and this you know."  I was strong beyond measure, Daddy Joe [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] had made a monster out of me.  I mean it was really, playing football, I use before I tackle somebody I would clap; I had so much aggression in me.  I mean I would, I would literally clap (claps hands) I would clap, I was so excited and that and if I tackled you, oh my God (laughter) I mean I was hitting hard.  I mean, I'm, I am a marshmallow compared to what I used to be.  I mean I have really, all that hardness because then I had that aggression in me, because it was all fresh aggression and I was out to hurt anyone in every the fights that I had in--the one fight I had in elementary school and one fight I had in, in high school will last forever.  If anybody still alive that was around those fights they'll tell oh my God 'cause I'm in both cases I almost beat the person to death.  And, and a psychiatrist would say well that comes from that's latent aggression from the fact that your father was aggressive.  And I mean I know 'cause I've been all the psych classes and I can analyze my own situation. But at that time I was definitely just moving on feeling and strength.  And I, I remember my play cousin we were sitting in Woodycrest we were sitting around talking about you know eating lunch and everybody was talking about who could beat who.  And so then Charlie said he could be Freddy and then Freddy say he could beat Linden and then Linden [ph.], my cousin he said, he said I can beat Chucky.  I said we never had a fight how you gonna say you can beat me, we ain't never fought.  He says, "I'm older than you."  He's like a year and a half I said that don't mean nothing.  And Mr. Craig [ph.] our counselor at the boys school he says all right let's eat real fast we're going in the gym.  Because whenever somebody talk that talk we go in the gym and take two wrestling mats and put the wrestling mats adjacent to each other.  And the first person the steps out the mat you know that's like a point you've lost.  And you put the gloves on, you know we didn't have no ring you know so the mats were the ring, and you put the gloves on.  You put the big old stupid gloves on, and you go at it and, and my cousin he's going well let's he wasn't really my cousin but we're so close we refer to each other like that.  We were he was talking so much smack and now we got the gloves on, we getting ready to fight in front of everybody.  And in the first round was like a feeling out round, I don't think we, I don't even think we hit each other.  And then next round I just went in.  I saw an opening and I hit him.  And he fell out cold, scared me to death.  I thought I'd killed him I had knocked him out literally.  And I stood there, I was ready, I was about ready to cry, because I didn't know what the deal was you know.  He was, but and then Mr. Kurt [ph.] said you know you much stronger than you realize.  He says that was one punch; I just caught him in the right spot.  But yeah but boarding school was where I got a chance to really see who I was, and, and in relationship to my peers.
Story_ID: 364572
Speaker 1: I had my first encounter with a pedophile, Mr. Tilly [ph.]. He was my counselor, I had been messing up my first semester at Woodycrest [Bronx, New York], man the girls, the freedom, not being around Daddy Joe [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis], not having feed no chickens and rabbits and weed no garden, I didn't have to do none of that stuff.  So I'm just like, I'm busting out, I'm busting, I'm like crazy, I'm a comedian I'm this, I'm that, I'm just, I'm having a ball.  And my grades were taking a beating (laughter) so I had like, I had I think I had like a D even which was totally unheard of.  And then I had some Cs I don't think I have one A.  I mean my, I was, I and this was, my mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] sent me here for me to get this education so I could get it together, become a doctor and blah, blah, blah, do all that stuff.  It ended up where it looked like I was getting ready to get kicked out because I wasn't even following up the academics.  And so that they had a big meeting with me and you know the whole bit and the next semester, my second chance to im- improve or be gone and I rocked, I just let everybody know.  I got A's in everything I think I may have had one B, and that's probably because I didn't like the teacher or something, I don't know.  But I was killing them, and Mr. Tilly, brother, who was my counselor he saw my reports, "I knew you could do it, I knew it, I knew it you could do it all I knew you could do it." And he and he was so excited, and I was happy, I was proud you know I mean you got a bunch of A's on a report card you know.  So I'm like I'm the man you know and he, and he says, aww and he puts his arms out and I, and he came to me and he hugged me.  And, and which seem perfectly fine until the hug didn't go away.  And as he's hugging me longer and longer, I'm like let, he's hugging me and hugging me longer and longer, my instincts said hit this motherfucker.  And I hit him upside his head, bam.  He said, "Don't tell nobody, don't tell nobody."  And the minute I remember I left his office and Ernest Solis [ph.], who's still a good friend of mine, he was older one of the kids I looked up to then.  He was a couple years older than me was a tough kid.  I said, "Man Mr. Tilly is a faggot," I said, "He's a faggot."  And I mean I was oh man so they gave him a leave of absence (laughter).  And they, they didn't take away his job though, then he came back he worked, he worked there at Woodycrest for a long time and, and I had, but they changed my counselor to Miss, Miss Kilgore [ph.] she became my a sister, she became my counselor.  So every, all of everything all my reports went to her and I just bypassed him, and every time I walked by him I looked at him and said ugh I would make faces you know but and I mean I was the wrong person to tell that to, don't tell nobody.  When he said that the first thing in my mind was I'm telling everybody 'cause and I didn't know what was going on, it was all instinct.  Because I didn't know, 'cause the hug just, he just wouldn't let me go, it was like he was holding on.  And something is telling me this ain't right, and my, my instincts, and I had no presupposition about his behavior.  We used to crack, because after the weekend, when he come in on Monday he have a Band-Aid here sometimes (points to his head) a band, we say, "Oh maybe he cut himself shaving."  Say he didn't cut himself shaving on his head; you know he wasn't shaving his head.  You know and he was having all kinds of wild affairs with these, with his lovers and.  And at the end of the weekend he'd be all messed up but he come to work and he was doing his job.  And he, and he stepped across the line with me and but they never got rid of him.  Nothing was ever proven he said he was just, he never did say that he was trying to do nothing to me.  But he, but he definitely, he got jacked upside his face because I felt that it was unnecessary.
Story_ID: 364573
Speaker 1: So who were the teachers that inspired you at the school?
Speaker 2: Miss Ann Carpenter was the greatest inspiration for me; she was my homeroom high school teacher and she was my mother away from home.  She was without question, she was the only black person that I know that studied Russian, understood Russian, spoke Russian, was a devout Communist without ever saying it.  And, and she hated America but she was cool as a cucumber.  Her and her husband are responsible for Harlem Prep [Harlem Preparatory School, New York, New York] which is a school that was created in the early, in the late '60s [1960s], the early '70s [1970s].  And it was created for the purpose of, of trying to help black folks in Harlem [New York, New York] area out who had not gone to school who had fallen by the wayside.  Her husband [Edward Carpenter] was a principal of a high school, and of a junior high school I think in Jersey, in Teaneck [New Jersey] and she was the head of the English department in, here in the city.  I went to Haaren High School [New York, New York].  Haaren High School is now John Jay College [John Jay College of Criminal Justice, New York, New York].  I went to school with Sylvester Stallone, he was in the school.  He was, he was a super duper senior that, Syl- Stallone for a dummy this guy has made a lot of money with this Rocky crap.  And it's amazing because I mean I know Sylvester Stallone and I know about him and he, and he ain't nowhere near Rocky he has made himself Rocky.  He's done what the, he's done the American Dream, he's created an illusion and it's working to the point where he could come back at sixty and do this shit again, that's crazy.  He and I both tried out for Under, Down the, 'Up the Down Staircase,' a movie with Sandy Dennis, which was filmed in my high school.  And we both went for parts and the guy says if your name is not called, you can go back to class.  And I knew I was gonna get the part 'cause I knew I was fly, he knew he was gonna get the part, neither one of us were asked.  We both were rejected.
Story_ID: 362452
Speaker 1: So anyway high school was very exciting and, and I went to the Haaren High School [New York, New York] because it was an all-boys school.  And I wanted to get an education.  I knew if I'd gone to school with girls it was gonna be a wrap.  So I was in school with a bunch of fellas, but I had a nice reputation, because my freshman year in music class, Mr. Achtel that was my music teacher's name.  He had us sit every other seat, and it just so happened where my last name Davis fell; I had a seat on the aisle.  So of course that's the most prized seat because when the bell rings you just get up you know get out.  And this guy comes in the class named Willie Green, came in late and he said, "You're sitting in my seat."  And I said, "I was just assigned this seat by Mr. Achtel."  He says, he says, "Man you sitting in my seat, you hear what I said man?  You sitting in my seat man get the fuck up."  That was cool, so when he said get the fuck up, I didn't say nothing.  I knew he was older than me, I knew I was just brand new in this school; I wasn't trying to get in no fight.  I didn't say anything, I just sat there, and he put his hands on me, and that was it.  When he did that, I don't, I can't tell you what took place first, all I know is that he was in between the radiator and the pipe.  And it was winter and the pipe was hot, and the radiator was hot.  And I'm beating the living shit out of him; I'm beating him as rapidly as you can blink.  I'm beating him unmercifully blood everywhere, and he's getting second degree burns from the radiator and the pipe.  I get walked down the hallway and I see Willie and I do like that and Willie would jump ten feet and I'd laugh.  Willie Green was supposed to be one of the toughest guys at Haaren High School when I arrived.  And he got beat down by me on the first, what it was like, it was winter semester so it was the first week I was in that class.  It was crazy, it was crazy, and, and nobody even challenged me and so consequently I would challenge people who would bother little kids.  If you were bothering a little guy and you know we didn't have no security guards then, none of that stuff.  You know we monitored the halls ourselves, so being the vice president of the G.O. this is my senior year.  I was vice president before, but I always did stuff, and, and after that fight, people would just thought that I was the toughest kid in the school.  Because Willie Green could fight, but what we had was a fight it wasn't a boxing match.  If we had had a boxing match, he may have beaten me up real bad, but that, it wasn't a boxing match.  And he didn't know, he didn't know to what level my aggression was, nobody knew.  And I didn't, I didn't look like a kid that would fight, you know I wasn't, I didn't have that kind of look, I wasn't, I didn't, I wasn't mean streaked.  I didn't have any kind of attitude, say, "Don't bring Chucky [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole] around here, he can, he likes to fight."  That was never my MO [modus operandi], never, never, never, I was never a fighter.  But people in high, elementary school, my elementary school classmates knew me better than anyone.  They said, "Don't mess with, don't mess with Charles 'cause he'll panic," so my nickname was Panic, (laughter) 'cause I didn't know could fight.  But I knew I could kick your ass you know and that was a big, that's a, there's a difference between fighting and boxing.  And Willie was my servant, my, my public servant the whole time I was in the school, until he got kicked out.  And he wanted to be my friend, he became a junkie, he had a wretched life, and I felt respon- I felt badly, I felt like maybe what I had done had done that to him.  For a minute I felt that, I didn't feel it for a long time, but I thought that you know I had taken advantage of somebody who was weak.  And I didn't know they were weak, he was three years older than me, how am I supposed to figure that out then?  But yeah it was, it was an interesting situation.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was Mr. Richstone [ph.] at Haaren [Haaren High School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Mr. Richstone was at Haaren?
Speaker 2: Mr. Richstone was in Haaren, yeah Mr. Richstone was my English teacher.  Mr. Richstone was like very important.  He was, man this man believed, I mean we actually used to read two books a month, it was crazy, I mean and have to write reports on books.  I mean 'The Old Man and the Sea' [Ernest Hemingway], 'Cry, the Beloved Country' [Alan Paton], I mean I remember every book that we read too just about.  And we'd go through it thoroughly, thoroughly, thoroughly.  He was really a college professor in a high school situation, I mean he wore a bow tie, he had a, he had the part down the middle of his head you know.  I mean you know it was this real classic, classic stereotypical English professor, but he happen a high school English teacher.  Ed Richstone, I loved Richstone, I really did, 'cause, he, he didn't play with us in terms of you got to master the language.  His whole thing was mastering the language.  And we've got great literature here that people have written and you need to know all the literature.  You need to, you need to be able to master this.  You know his whole thing is, was coming from a mastering position of the language and, and reading and all of that.  And we, and I, I and, and plus my, my homeroom teacher was also an English teacher, and Ann Carpenter and so I was, and I was a natural English student.
Story_ID: 362454
Speaker 1: I mean that was, I mean if, I guess if people had listened to me then when I was a kid or whatever, they would probably assume that I was gonna be a teacher.  Because when it came, when we got to the section on poetry, oh my god, I actually did, I actually took words from Ann Carpenter's class and got real arrogant one day and said, "All right, these words what do you want us to do with these words?"  She said, "Well put them in a composition. Well come up first, get the definitions (yawns) and always remember the primary definition is the one that we usually go with."  And she would break us down and say that you'll see two or three different definitions in the dictionary.  And she says, "But then use these words in a composition."  So then I'm thinking to myself composition, I said, "Could that be a poetic composition?"  And she says, "If you can put these words in a poem, I'll give you, I'll give you not one but two extra credits."  I said, "Oh really?"  And that's what I did.  I, I, I took vocabulary words from the board and I was going out with a sister that was going to Boston--going to Borough of Manhattan Community College [New York, New York] and we were having difficulties.  First of all I lied about my age, I lied about where I was going to school, I told her I was at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], I was in high school [Haaren High School, New York, New York].  I was a sophomore in high school, and, and I wrote a poem about our relationship.  "She's a rose of many thorns tearing pride out of my heart / Though she blossoms in many forms, her thorns remain always sharp / She rips, she hurts yet stays projecting seductively fragrant perfumes / I protest in so many ways but my manhood she somehow consumes / I'm torn between love and masculinity and the latter I need the most / The life of mine is separate entity, I'm a man this I cannot boast / She more woman than I am man, knows not her place by me / She thinks me a cactus living in sand, closing her ears to my plea / Let me free to roam in your garden, let me free to pride in your perfume / For the love I feel will soon be pardoned by the manhood I must quickly resume."  Of course I got extra credit, and Miss Carpenter she told me, she says, "I don't know if anybody's told you this before but you're a poet.  And maybe that will come in handy in the future."
Speaker 2: Did you know you were a poet before, before this?
Speaker 1: (Shakes head) I had written a poem in elementary school with the help of a librarian who nobody liked 'cause he was soft.  He was probably gay, I mean but Mr. Orr [ph.] was cool with me, and he didn't try no funny business with me.  And I was asked when I was in the fifth grade to write a poem for graduation.  I wasn't even graduating you know, this is the sixth grade is when you graduated. I and I didn't understand until oh some years later that the reason I was asked because I was the best English, I was the best English student in the school at--in that elementary school. I, I had won spelling bees, I had written good reports.  Whenever I had to do the oral report, I was always better than the rest of the kids, 'cause I had my mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] at home to help me.  'Cause remember I did anything she would, she was, she was serious night watchman over everything.  She wants to see my work; she want to see everything, everything, nothing went unnoticed.  So I actually you know I--it's, it's like when I did this poem, I didn't know, I didn't have any idea how to do the poem.  And I went to Mr. Orr and I told him I was asked to do the poem, and he laughed.  And he says, "And you don't know why?" I said, he says, "Well it's okay."  He says, "I'll help you write the poem."  And he says, "Well what do you think about when you think about graduation?"  I said, (shrugs shoulders). I said, he says, "We're gonna make a list of words that rhyme that deal with graduation.  So what comes to mind?" I said school bells you know, I think that was the first thing that came to my mind, maybe first or second.  And he said, "Well what, what rhymes with school bell?"  He says, "Like let's say what you, you're leaving school you know what do you call that?"  I said, "Well it's like you're saying goodbye to your friends and people that you knew, teachers you knew."  "So what's another word for goodbye that deals with school bells--sounds like school bell?" I said, "Farewell?"  He says, he says, "All right, so then," and, and we took each pair and worked it you know, had a poem.  The poem was up in the school for a long time, but I never considered myself a poet though, at that time.  I just 'cause first of all, he helped me write the poem, so I really kind of considered him to be my secret help you know.  But this time, when I did 'Emancipation,' which is the one I just recited I did that on my own, I was dipping and dabbing in poetry as a, as a just something to do.  That I liked to, that I thought was interesting, it was interesting to me.
Story_ID: 362455
Speaker 1: And then when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died it really, really, really--when King got killed it took on a whole another meaning to me.  Because it was like, it was how dare you kill this man of peace you know, I mean he was not about fighting back even and gets blown away.  I mean I was, cause I knew I could never march with Dr. King, I was, that was out, I wasn't gonna let nobody spit on me and call me names, and not fight back.  But how they were gonna just kill this man like that, so I wrote a, I wrote a few poems and that you can see that led right into The Last Poets.  'Cause in '68 [1968], when I was supposed to got started, but when I wrote 'Emancipation,' you know I was just exercising some skills that I didn't even really know I had.
Speaker 2: So when you were, when you were still in high school [Haaren High School, New York, New York] then is when you discovered the African religion?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How did that come about, who, who exposed you to it?
Speaker 1: We had a day off of school, half a day or something and me and my man we would go to either the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] or to Harlem [New York, New York].  You go to the Village if you want to see a freak show, you come to Harlem if you want to see black people, get that, that black experience.  So we decided to come to Harlem and in walking down Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard], I think it was Lenox, there was, or maybe it was on 7th [7th Avenue; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard].  No, no it's 119th Street, I remember that, I think it was Lenox, there was this African hut looking structure.  And when we both saw it, we both started laughing, we said whoa this is funny, 'cause the only thing we knew of Africa was Tarzan.  So say, to see some African artifact or some African motif anything, was like a joke to me.  I didn't take it seriously, I didn't want to be African, that was for sure 'cause that was a turnoff.  You had already really through the Little Rascals and all their little shows on TV, they made you hate Africa you know.  So I wasn't trying to deal with no African nothing, and then we're laughing at this place in this man comes out and he's real light skinned, and he's got on full African garb and I'm trying to figure out what kind of masquerade party is this cause he ain't even African.  You know and he wearing African glo- garb and because I thought all Africans were blue black, I just had a stereotypical notion of what Africans and what Africa was.  And as the man invited us inside and he said, he said, "Maybe there's some other things you might wanna laugh at."  And we inside the place, inside this space with masks all over the place, and incense burning.  It was a real kind of a scary experience for a moment there because I didn't know what we were getting into.  And then he told me, "Sit down."  He was pleasant you know he wasn't nothing unpleasant about him, and he became my godfather.  He, he said he here's a black stone here's a white stone, I want to shake and separate, so I separate. He picked a hand and opened it, he writes something down do the same process, pick a hand, open, he writes something down.  After about ten minutes, fifteen minutes he, he said, "Okay, you got two girlfriends, one you like really a lot, and having little problems with her.  And there's one that really likes you but you're not giving her the time of day, and she's on the verge of suicide."  And I'm saying, "How the hell does he know this?"  And I said, "How do you know?"  He said, "I'm reading it, I'm reading everything," he said, "I can read it in the shells, this is what the Oracle says."  And he gave me some breakdown, but it was just quick and I couldn't, I was, I felt like he had just exposed me to you know.  'Cause stuff he was talking about, I was the only one who knew it, and now here's a system that can actually go inside of your soul and tell people what you're thinking and what you're feeling, oh my God.
Story_ID: 362456
Speaker 1: He says, "Oh and let me give you your name before we, before you go."  And I took total offense to that I said give me, I said I have a name.  I said, "My name is Charles Franklin Davis [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole] and my friends call me Chucky," I said, "I have a name."  I said. "Matter of fact when I'm really rocking with the boy they call me Lucky Chucky."  So he says, "That's your slave name," says, "you were given those names," he said, "you that you had a language before you came."  And I'm like, "I ain't no slave."  He says, "I'm not saying you a slave but," he, he says, "but that, the name is a slave name."  He says, "All the names and he said Johnson, Williams, Davis all those names were taken on by the Africans, because they were forbidden to speak their own language, and they had names but they were treated like they were nameless people because that was the cruelty of slavery."  He just broke it down, but he, but he didn't even say it as, as like I'm saying.  You know he said it like matter of fact, (unclear) he didn't spend time like if you didn't know this you just were just, you just were, butt out you know.  But he's just saying like this is what happened, this is why this happening.  And he's saying it casually; he's not beating anything down on me or nothing.  But he said anyway here's your name in case you decide to use it, it's Abiodun Oyewole and he wrote it down phonetically so I can say it.  He who brings joy into the town and good fortune follows me, your name is the name given to the child born on a holiday usually.  And you're born the 25th of February, he says it's not a holiday here but in Osogbo [Nigeria] is a feast of the kings of Yoruba people; the whole weekend is celebration, so that's where your name come from.  And I said oh I be what (laughter)?  Abiodun I said Odun that don't even sound African that sound Irish (laughter).  So I was finding every little thing I could find to not get down with that.  And about a year later, two years later somehow, maybe two years later, this was for The Last Poets, I know that, or maybe during The Last Poets.  Somebody said from the stage we were all sitting up here with these slave names proud to be called by our slave names.  And, and I looked at my boys I said, "I ain't got no slave name," I said, "I got an African name."  They said, "Get out here your name is Chucky, you got a real slave name," and they started slapping five and laughing.  I said, "If you call me Chucky again I'm not even answering."  I said, "My name is Abiodun and I said you gotta call me Abiodun." It wasn't even like shortened like everybody calls me Dun now, I was such a wreck, a hardliner, I didn't shave anymore, I never let nobody call me Chucky, my mother and I didn't talk for five years.  My real mother [Mattie Robinson Dawson] and I, my real mother because I ran into her at the bus stop and she said look like a beast won't you shave?  And I had a beard, I mean I thought I looked cool, she was like, 'cause she was clean, straight-laced.  She didn't like the way I looked and I said my name is not Chucky, my name is Abiodun, she said well I'm calling you Charles and you got that from your grandfather [Charles Robinson], and I'm a call you Charles for the rest of my life.  Well when she introduces me to her church and to other people she says my son Abiodun Oyewole, and she says it better than I, that I say it.  So everything had changed Dun can change, everything can change, but you have to be sincere about the changes you make in order for the changes to take place.  And, but that was basically it, the getting of my name, getting my name gave me a platform that I didn't know was gonna be so wonderful. 'Cause it did take me a couple of years before I really adopted it.
Story_ID: 364395
Speaker 1: --Supposed to be making it more complicated you know, I, I know that I'm effective in the schools, because I use a lot of poetic images when I'm explaining things to kids.  I know for example, that I watch sports a lot because I love the poetry of motion but I also the poetic descriptions of the, of the game.  For example, Jason Kidd was off last night and the guy said, "He couldn't have thrown it in the ocean if he was standing on the beach."  I mean that's, that's poetry, I mean and there's always that kind of poetry in describing the, the physical event, which also happens to be poetic.  You know it's, it's you know poetry is not an intellectual thing; it's intellectual in that you do have to think.  It provokes thinking, it makes you think and, and all of us have enough intellect to think or else we're just brain-dead.  And then we shouldn't be here anyway or we should be in an institution or something.  But the, the fact that it provokes thought and it provokes thought from a different place than a normal conversation might provoke thought.  That's a good thing and that might be called intellectual but it's solely not intellectual, because a lot of that provoked provocation of thought is going to, it, it comes sometimes with the feel, and most of the time in poetry it ha- it comes also with the feeling.  And that feeling is very primeval and very unintellectual, it's very instinctive.  I can feel this and at the same time, what's, what's it's saying to my mind I can digest and take in and gain something from it, but I feel the, the image of the, the picture that was painted, the taste that was created, the sound whatever was so vivid, so good and so thorough.  And so I felt it and I thought about it at the same time while or I may have thought about it later, but I really felt it first.  That was the initial thing.  So the poet has that, when you get strictly head and not feeling you lose people.  You become maybe you're odd because nobody else can do what you do, and you happen to have been given a platform maybe to get off like that.  But the reality is you wanna be understood, I mean I think I, I think above and beyond everything, I wanna be understood.  And if--I have a poem entitled 'Another Mountain' [Abiodun Oyewole] for example, and it is a poem that nobody could look at and say, "What race wrote this poem?"  They wouldn't know, it was, there's no indication of any race at all, the poem is just totally universal, because I'm talking about life is a challenge and I'm using a mountain as the, the metaphor, and I take it from there.  And, and in doing that, it's like it, you can take that poem to kids that are just learning how to read.  And because the image, because the climb, because of the struggles of reaching, reaching something they can feel this and the intellectual piece may come much later.  But they can definitely feel the energy of trying to reach the top, trying to become big like your sister and brother trying to you know sit in the big chair instead of the little chair.  I mean they can; there are certain things that are attached to their existence now that allows them to recognize the value of that poem.  So consequently that poem has been published about eighteen different times in different places.  I get, every now and then I get a, a thing in the mail from some company that wants to reproduce it, reprint that poem, ah man that's so nice.  'Cause the, the interest's gone up (laughter) right before the five hundred something fifteen hundred that's please, yeah reprint it (laughter) reprint it in other languages yeah, 'Another Mountain.'  You can go online and see that piece, it's amazing, and I people, and some people that don't know I mean and most people that know that poem don't even know I'm one of The Last Poets and they consider that one of the greatest poems I ever written.  I feel so proud 'cause it's not a poem that I recite you know.  It's a poem that's, I wrote just because it was one of those introspective pieces you know.
Story_ID: 364396
Speaker 1: So I'll just say we're rolling on tape six (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: Today is February 22nd [2007], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The tape is rolling okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah you can just state your full name for me again.
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Abiodun Oyewole.
Speaker 1: And that's it.  We're continuing from--
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: We're just continuing from a previous interview before.
Story_ID: 364397
Speaker 1: One thing I want to say before we move on is the, the one you said that was a void of color.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Or anything you know the politics it was void knowing who had written it.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did that come from a different place in you than the stuff that wears the color that you know exactly oh a black guy wrote that?
Speaker 2: No, you know I think that the truth is the truth and that the truth doesn't always have a direct attachment to a particular color or racial situations.  I think that we can do that we can always plot that course because we're trying to reach a certain set of people so we gonna you know brown it up a bit and do whatever, but when you're dealing with truths, when you're dealing with the day to day struggle it's something.  And this is one of the things that I think is one of the major reasons why The Last Poets have become a, a big, we got a fan base now that so international, because people identify with the struggle that we were talking about and, and they identified with the, even though we may not use the word niggers, we were chastised niggers.  And a lot of people that have fallen into the category of being niggers, they don't use the term that's not a part of their vocab, but they understand that, that feeling.  And they and they're striving to be like them based on what they say hip hop and everything else.  But the deal is that the, the attitude about the, the attitude of understanding of who you are and recognizing that you can't, that in order for you to develop yourself, you have got to recognize all of the aspects of your existence.  You can't just be one-sided you just can't be lopsided, you got to be honest with you and, and your pain is your pain.  And sometimes your pain may not have the color of mahogany or dark brown or, or anything like that, it just may be pain that's clear like water.  And everybody has that same pain, and every, and people can relate. 'Another Mountain' [Abiodun Oyewole] is one of those pieces that, that has an essence sometimes it's a mountain that I must climb.  Even after I've climbed one already, but my arms are tired, my legs are weary, my eye, my mind is weary right now and need to rest.  I'm botching it up, but it's basically but I must climb before the storm comes before the earth rocks.  And an avalanche smother and before the storm comes before the avalanche of clouds, smother my soul.  I must climb, and I tell myself it's just so more dirt and stone and every now and then I should reach another plateau.  And enjoy the trees and the flowers below; I'm strong enough to climb.  I am young enough to reach into any top; you see the, the wind has warned me about peace about settling without peace without struggle.  Wind has warned me about settling too long and taught me how to fly, but my wings only work after I've climbed the mountain.  And that's a paraphrasing piece I, I missed some lines.  But that piece speaks of the struggle, that struggle is universal.  Then when we speak about the struggle that takes place amongst black people in Harlem [New York, New York] where, where the--'From Niggers Get Revolution' [sic.] or 'When the Revolution Comes' or whatever that case may be.  And we throwing out things that have all kinds of racial epitaphs and so forth and so on dealing with how would the disparaging with the system and, and the racist attitudes that struggle also is, is seen again more paramount than maybe the racial tones.  Because the people can identify with the struggle, the racial piece is a part of what's happening that the mix.  Those are the characters that are in the struggle but the fact that what we're, our passion is we want change.  And that echoes loud throughout the entire world, and consequently we go to Austria and the place is packed and ain't nobody black on stage but us, ain't nobody black but us.  And the eleven of us, and I'm trying, and I'm trying to figure out why do they come out in the cold weather and pack the place just see us.  I mean, I even the guy that brought us to this place was actually the name of the club was Porgy and Bess [Vienna, Austria].  I asked him I said who else is before me here tonight he said oh just The Last Poets, just The Last Poets.  And I was like what, this is crazy I'm not aware of how they--but what it is it's like anybody who takes their truth and passionately presents it in an artistic form be it poetry, song, blues, jazz whatever and does it really, does, does it, does it sincerely and powerfully is gonna get attention.  Even though you may think this is just my own homegrown thing, your homegrown thing happens to have tentacles that reach all the way around the world.  And that's key and I think that's one of the reasons why our struggle as people, black people throughout our civil rights struggle has been a, a hallmark of all struggles throughout the world.  You know people look at that as, as--I know brothers have been treated differently in Vietnam because people were aware of the struggles that we had to go through just to get the voting rights, and all that stuff.  I know brothers who actually were treated very, very differently by the enemy (laughter) because they knew you were sent over here.
Story_ID: 364398
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Take me back to the day, The Poets [The Last Poets] was created and, and you know and just set up that whole day for me.
Speaker 2: It was Malcolm X's birthday celebration commemoration of, of Malcolm X he had been, he had been dead now for three years.  He was killed on February 21, 1965, and May 19th is his birthday, and May 19th 1968, David Nelson asked me would I be willing--long before the May 19th, he asked me would I be willing to perform on that date.  And, and I said I would, I said sure you know I, I was gung ho I wanted to be in Harlem [New York, New York], I wanted to be a part of the black movement.  I mean I was, I had a desire I wanted to get involved, this was happening.
Speaker 1: So if you had to point to things that led you up to that moment like I'll just say turning points things that did what were the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death the cat, the killing of Dr. King, that really turned me around totally.  Because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were you before that?
Speaker 2: I was in college [Buena Vista College; Buena Vista University, Storm Lake, Iowa].
Speaker 1: I, I'm not--where but who, like what type of person you said but that totally turned you on.
Speaker 2: Before, before well I've always been outspoken, I was always in high school [Haaren High School, New York, New York], I was outspoken I mean and, I mean and when I went away to college I was very outspoken.  I actually I started a serious protest against what I call legislative worship in Iowa.  In all the schools in Iowa you have, if you go to college in Iowa it's mandatory maybe it's not anymore but it was back then.  That you had one, you had chapel and convocational, one day you had to do chapel and another day you had to go to convocation.  That's manda- that's a credit if you don't get that credit you're never gonna graduate.  So me and another cat from Harlem we actually, we just felt man this is crazy this is like they're gonna force us to worship you know.  And we might not even be down with that and I definitely didn't wanna do all that, so we had a protest.  We had a serious protest going on had all these white radical kids involved, and they all agree, we called it legislative worship, we wrote up a little manifesto.  And then we got all these kids, I had about thirty white kids to pull the fire alarms in thirty different places all over the campus at the same time.  We had caused nothing but mayhem, it was crazy.  And I was you know then they kicked me out of school, but they wanted to but I left anyway after that year.  'Cause it was, I was Drake [Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa], I was in Iowa oh my God I mean it was a great experience but I had to have something a little have more juice in my life.  And so that was the beginning so I had that fire and I was always doing stuff.  So when I had a chance to, then when I was in Harlem I was working with David Nelson at an anti-poverty program called Double Block Recreational Educational Program [ph.].  It was between 199th Street, 118th Street, Lexington [Avenue] and 3rd [Avenue], I'll never forget.  And I was like the assistant recreational guy so I was the guy--I guess because I, I was an athlete, I can play ball, and basically that's what I was doing playing basketball with the kids and stuff.  I suppose you know and, and I got paid and we were sharing poetry you know he wrote poetry.  He was writing stuff in Spanish and English he was very romantic and we had, and I was writing poetry a little bit.  And I just found it kind of like it, it was like something just to do you know I, I had like I had a knack for it you know.
Story_ID: 364399
Speaker 1: And it's seemed I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What were you talking about though?
Speaker 1: I was writing well I had written a couple of pieces inside stuff I mean like--
Speaker 2: What kind of stuff?
Speaker 1: A couple of love pieces, a couple like one of the things that I had written--what, what made me, I guess kind of proud of the fact that I had had some skills in the area that I knew I could write poetry, was the fact that in high school [Haaren High School, New York, New York], I had my, my homeroom teacher, Ann Carpenter had given us vocabulary words to put into composition.  And I took those vocabulary words and I said to her I said suppose I put them in to a poem can I get extra credit?  She said if you can take those ten words and put them in a poem I will give you two extra credits.  So, at the time I had a relationship with this young lady and I was had written a poem.  I was also trying to be impressive because I went out with older women I only.  I mean I went out, I was like fifteen and I found, I was very interested in seventeen and eighteen-year-old girls you know I didn't like girls my age.  So that was another thing I figured you know writing a poem or even giving them that having the ability to write poetry would fascinate them, and it did and so forth.  And it was cool, and in this particular case the sister I was going out with, we're having a little difficulty.  I mean I'm a kid but I wanna be a man, I had this eager desire to grow up kind of fast.  And so I took the challenge on Mrs. Carpenter was gonna give me this extra credit and I took the ten words and did--well I remember the poem because this is what really kind of set me off into recognizing I had, I really had bona fide skills.  The name of the poem was 'Emancipation.'  "She's a rose of many thorns tearing pride out of my heart /  Though she blossoms in my forms her thorns remain always sharp / She rips, she hurts, yet stays projecting, seductively fragrant perfumes / I protest in so many ways but my manhood she somehow consumes / I'm torn between love and masculinity and the latter I need the most / Her life of mine a separate entity, I'm a man this I cannot boast / She more woman than I'm man knows not her place by me / She thinks me a cactus that's withering in sand closing her ears to my plea / Let me free to roam in your garden, let me free to pride in your perfume / For the love I feel will soon be pardoned by the man that I must quickly resume."  And I got all my credits (laughter) and, and that piece became like at least, it gave me it, it just let me know that I can, I can take the pieces, I can take the words like a puzzle.
Speaker 2: But I don't understand like how did that come to you, like you know how, did it (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know like I say it starts out, you know and the term is a cheap term but it's a knack.  I mean it's like you have to have a feel for this thing.  It's something that you know it's like you know we all have gifts and it's like its, it's, you say it's a gift that's another term.  You know all I know is that I've always found it easy to manipulate words whether it's in conversation or in writing.  It was never anything that was difficult for me to do, words were made to be used in different--and I've always also been very conscious of terms.  I, I mean there are certain terms that I get stuck on like a lot of us, but things like kiss my ass and suck my dick, I always think they were bad terms, because I appreciate my ass and I like my dick and would never want nobody that I don't like to be thinking they can get close to me like that (laughter).  So but, so I take the words seriously, so that's, I think that's I think it starts with a certain consciousness that you just have.  I don't know, if I can give that to you, I think that you know my mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis], I know she was serious about the way I spoke and she, she drilled me about articulating.  That was a part of my being and we talked about the last time, and, and I was I always had presence in terms of my vocals whatever it was you know.  Singing or, or speaking and I wanted to say something that made sense and I wanted to say it in a way that would make you think about it.  So I had a, I always had a poetic headset when I look back on what really defines a poet.  A poet is somebody who doesn't give you anything new; he simply makes you look at it in another way.  And because we can't recreate, the wheel, the wheel's here, but now have you ever thought about the way it rolls like this?  You know I mean it can roll like that too, and you see it, now you say wow the first time that wheel becomes something more than what it has been.  And that's what the poet does, that's what poet brings to life that whole aspect that we sometimes put off into the side of; we don't quite give credit to or credence to, and, and that has always been a personal thrill for me to do that in a conversation, to do that in, in just trying to explain things.
Story_ID: 364400
Speaker 1: I think one of the reasons why I like teaching because it gives me a, a challenge to see if I can break this down so that person can really get it, but in order to do that you have to have desire.  I have that desire.  The desire is in me to want to do that, to want to reach you, you know, and to want to reach you, that's, that's everything.  You know like, like I, I feel so bad right now; we got people who have developed all kinds of walls and fences against people just on image alone when the fact is that lot of times those images are put there just because the protection because they're afraid somebody's gonna hurt them.  And, and I'm like you know I can't make you tear your wall down, but if you care to see you know, we are all naked here.  You know and nobody is really, nobody is really got anything happening over anybody else.  And we can, and, and we all got things to share, we all got gifts, I don't care who you are, where you are, what, what your status is on any level.  But we all got something to share, it's one big pot, now you, I may not exactly like what you do when you're off hours but what you bring to the table I need you know.  And, and that's so important to me as a human being because I've been blessed to meet people of good faith, good will, good service, good love, good energy all over the world.  And it's been a joy; I mean I have not been cheated out of meeting angels, and, and so consequently to me all I want to do is be good, a good angel too you know.
Speaker 2: So you, we so that, that kind of for me sums up what you were writing about early on.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Story_ID: 364401
Speaker 1: Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination happened.  You said that was a turning point (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was the turning point.
Speaker 1: And it changed the way you write or the way you see--
Speaker 2: I made me--
Speaker 1: --the struggle.
Speaker 2: It made me political.
Speaker 1: How had you seen the struggle before that you start?
Speaker 2: Well, I always felt that you know black people getting a bad deal you know I always felt that because my parents, [Oyewole's maternal aunt and uncle, Elvenia Robinson Davis and Joseph Davis] were always talking about that, and I could see.  You know, racism is not you know something you gotta look for you know, it's in your face.  Back you know we all got smacked by it but you know I can there are certain things that were obvious and that I felt needed changes, and, and I my, because I was raised by older parents, I, they had a keen understanding what was going on.  And, and then there were certain systems that I had just began to personally just appalled like the insurance system.  I mean I watched the insurance man that he come every week or whatever, whatever every other week or whenever he came once I month I guess.  And he, he'd get the money and he became like a member of the family, and he then died and his son took over and I.  And then when my mother died, we didn't hardly have enough money to bury her.  And I said Lord have mercy I said what the, and I watched this all my life.  I said what kind of system so it made me, so I started thinking about the system, just from looking my own being raised and so.  You know I was read, I would read some literature on Marx [Karl Marx] or Lenin [Vladimir Lenin] or and or comments literature just to see what this thing about systems.  And I started recognizing that every system employs aspects of other systems and said there's no one set.  I mean so one people wanted we gonna create one particular thing, and, and just say this is ours, we Communists or we're capitalist and we don't mix and mingle.  And that's just nonsense, because so, but I start looking at all of that.  And I had never thought about looking at things like this, because I had still contended that Martin Luther King's assassination really came about because he started talking about, against the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War].  The war in Vietnam was a big money thing, and, and it's just like this 'Rocky' thing; it's big bucks.  And Martin being the most influential voice in the country at the time, and people were listening to him.  He really, I think stepped on the toes of the big boys who wanted to maintain that war.  And I think that was, well other aspects as well, but I think that was one of the things.  So it just caused me to look at the bigger picture beyond my community.  Beyond I mean make me started making me really politically conscious about the government in a, in a more ser- serious way than I'd ever been before.  'Cause I was always scheduled to succeed, I was gonna be okay, my life was charmed, I mean I was a great kid, I was loved by people, I didn't have any real issues.  But now I realize that we're all being set up here and this is, and when King got killed--just because he was so nonviolent and I knew I could've marched with them.  But when he got killed, that just changed my head, so I started really just doing my own personal investigation into what, what's really going on with America, what America is really about, and the foreign policy and everything just recognizing that this country has been taking us to hell in a hand basket for a long time.  Just because certain people are greedy and the greed aspect doesn't get any less, it gets worse and worse and worse.  And it's almost like I got all the food in the world, but I want more and they just keep on wanting more.  And then you can get some cohorts, you get people who don't a little bit, but you give them a little something, something just to help support whatever madness you're doing.  And they'll champion whatever you do because they getting some crumbs and they're satisfied.  So those, those aspects I had to speak out against that, all of that stuff because I still see Earth as a paradise.  I still see this as the only place; forget that outer space playing that's nonsense.  I think if we do that, we need to do that like the way the Egyptians did it outer body experiences, send them out of the room and go all over the planet easily.  Any other planet from right where I'm here, right here not on a ship, not on some machine, not on some, I just think that's the wrong focus.  And the whole spiritual piece, the whole, what, what is this, this now we're not dealing with anything sacred anymore.  Nothing is sacred, everything is up for grabs, it doesn't matter you know.  And, and those things disturb me so trying to get back to humanity and recognizing that the warmonger is serious, was probably one of the motivating factors in me changing my style of poetry, yeah.
Story_ID: 364402
Speaker 1: And you became a voice for?
Speaker 2: You know, that's the part that still is just amazing to me, and I, I have great, great respect for, a great, great, great respect for, for the fact that there's so many poets in the world (laughter) so many people running they mouth and so many voices.  And for people to say to me, even now that they like my voice and they like my poetry is still a fantastic compliment to me.  And I don't know how it's ever gonna change.  It's like, it's like the very first time I ever been comp-I can't, I can't look at it and say, well yeah everybody likes my stuff.  I can't, I can't do that I just because that's a, that's a tender thing man, that's like you know and, and it's, it's so many other people that have said things.  And so how did I get fortunate enough to be a cat who sa- who, who the people wanted to hear what I had to say you know.  I mean a classic example, we just did, we did the Smithsonian on January 11, they sold-out before we got there, a week before the Smithsonian was sold-out.  I was under the impression this was gonna be in a theatre in the--it was Smithsonian Ana- Anacostia [Anacostia Community Museum, Washington, D.C.] that's the, that's Smithsonian but it's, there's a Smithsonian in the hood in Anacostia [Washington, D.C.].  So I thought that maybe a theatre in the hood we gonna do that, and that's, and we've had packed places many times that's what we do you know.  No, this is the Smithsonian and it was packed it was like sold-out, I said this is crazy.  It was all us, it was chocolate city down, but it was, it was packed and I was like, I said wow, this is amazing.  Okay, that was D.C. [Washington, D.C.] the next week the 20th and I had designed this myself, the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] sold out, it was the coldest night we had before we had the cold weather later on.  It was the coldest night, the pla- they had to go get chairs from another facility, and I live in Harlem [New York, New York], this is home.  And to get that kind of, and I, and when I walked on the stage, I told the people, I said I feel like Muhammad Ali.  I feel like the heavyweight champ of the world because when they took away his crown, the people said you our champ.  Told him you still the champ, champ, you know and they kept and, and that, and that's exactly how I feel.  Now true, I'm a worker you know, I'm not a slouch you know, I, I work with the kids, I got people grown that stop me in the middle of the street, "Yo Brother Dun [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole], remember how you had you in P.S. 154 [P.S. 154, Harriet Tubman School, New York, New York], remember you my teacher?"  I'm at a Rocket game, this guy this big, fat guy talking about, "Yo, remember I had you when I was in the third grade?"  Baby I didn't know; you didn't look like that, you don't look like that now, in the third grade you look a little different you know.  But it, that, that's a joy and then the people with, so the people have really said point-blank yes, we like what you're saying.  We like how you're saying it, the group represents it, and you represent and the group represents, this is what we need, we endorse this.  And that's how you, that's how you do the things you do, I mean I don't care if it's making sweet potato pies or people you still making them pies, I'm gone be over there to get one.  I mean that makes you wanna make more pies you know.  So that endorsement has really still to this day, that'll, that still humbles me, keeps me recognized.  And so all I really wanna do with that is just be better and better, you know I don't, I don't think I've written maybe the, I mean I, I think I've written some great stuff and I think nothing should be compared but I think I got some more stuff to write.
Story_ID: 364403
Speaker 1: Up to you were gonna take me--the King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, to the day.
Speaker 1: To the day.
Speaker 2: To the day, May 19th.
Speaker 1: And what'd you done prior to that, to make you think you could you know once invited participate on that level?
Speaker 2: That's a great question. I was, when David [David Nelson] asked me to, to do this, I was, I was functioning strictly on guts and nerve.  Because I hadn't done anything, I mean had sung in some places, I mean I, I mean I had done little stuff here and there.  But I had done nothing, I mean I wasn't afraid of the stage, the stage was cool, it's easy, that wasn't--but I was truly intimidated with the idea that I was gonna be doing something in a park in Harlem [New York, New York].  I looked at Harlem like it was one big giant Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York].  I expected that the Sandman if I got on stage and did something and it wasn't good, that the Sandman, a whole bunch of Sandmen were gonna come out and scoop me up and take me off, and that was gonna be the end.  I mean I, so I did, and, and I think that's probably one of the smartest things I ever did.  I actually because of my fear of, of this day coming up, May 19th and we doing perform, I came to Harlem and walked around.  And listened to the people, I got a vibe, I didn't know what to write, I didn't know what, I was gonna how what, I was gonna 'cause I knew, I was moving, I was stepping into that place I wanted to play.  I wanted to be, I was stepping into the place of being a, a revolutionary poet, I mean of saying something to be a part of the movement.  I was getting, I was getting my, my initial rites of passage, this is what was happening.  But I didn't know what to say, you know I mean I didn't have, I did, I had some racial experiences, but nothing so dominant that, I had , I was enraged, so I mean, so I said let me come to Harlem and hear what the people are saying.  And it was an expression that was going around at the time.  "What, what's your thing?"  And brother says what's your thing, he's not talking about like you work for IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] or DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company].  It's like what's your revolutionary affiliation, what are you a Muslim or are you a Panther [Black Panther Party]?  What's your thing brother, you know that was like, so thing became like this kind of revolutionary pronoun you know.  What's your thing, you know and, and everybody, and it was right in line with this song that was out by The Isley Brothers, (singing) "It's your thing.  Do what you wanna do. I can't tell you who to sock it to," ['It's Your Thing'].  And, and so the thing became, and as we, we you know we have that ability, we can take a word make it a bunch of words you know.  We just can do whatever, you know as long as we communicating then everybody knows what point were on, we're good to go.  So I took that line, what's your thing and I said, "What is your thing brother / Is it a Black thing / Or will it save black women and black children?  / Will it raise black men?"  You know so I just went on and, and build on that, and that was my very, very first poem.
Story_ID: 364404
Speaker 1: Now before we actually went on the stage, however, we went--David Nelson lived right around the corner from Mount Morris Park [New York, New York], he, it was convenient.  So he, I, we went there to his house, he said, "I met this other guy named Gylan Kain, I met Kain in the park."  Then we all went upstairs, David's house.  Now Kain he had met at a poetry reading right here at Columbia University [New York, New York] about a week before, no two weeks before.  And he invited him because he liked his poetry; he thought that that would be cool.  So we went over to David's house and we sat there for a minute and we talked about how we were gonna go on stage and we thought maybe we would sing and somebody would do maybe a poem up on front so I, I had maybe someone try singing 'Ooo Baby Baby,' maybe that'll be slick you know.  I mean that was one of the hit songs at the time (singing), "Ooo baby baby." Kain couldn't hold a note if you handed to him.  David's all right, his voice is kind of weak but he, it wasn't, that was not gonna be our forte.  So I said, now I had just seen a demonstration on television, it was a demonstration by the students of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And it was to try to get, they were having issues with their president and if I recall his name was Nesbitt [sic. James M. Nabrit, Jr.].  And they didn't want him there anymore, they wanted him out, and they had an effigy of him hanging up in the tree.  And they were marching around and they were chanting, "Are you ready nigger is you got to be ready. Are you ready--?"   Then they go off into, "Beep, beep, bang, bang, ungawa, black power. Beep, beep, bang, bang are you ready nigger is you got to."  And I thought that was so hot, so I said now I know we can't sing together but everybody can chant.  So I said we're gonna chant are you ready niggers, so we practiced it, I said we go on stage, that's what we gonna do.  There was a brother named Hakim [ph.], he's now like a documenteur, he jock- he's a film guy, he does a lot, you see him in jazz concerts all over the place.  He's got a long beard, he's got a camera always now, but he used to be one of the baddest djembe drummers.  And he had a dance troupe and everything for a long time, he just changed courses and he's a Pisces, he can do that.  And, and he was on stage with some drummers and dancers on that very first day.  And then they were packed, getting ready to pack up and leave and give us the stage, and I said, "No, no, stay right there."  So that's how the drums got involved right away, because I felt that that would give added rhythm you know.  And it did, and we had the entire park, "Are you ready niggers, you got to be ready." The drummers were playing.  And David had his poem entitled 'Are You Ready Black People,' Gylan Kain had his poem entitled 'Niggers Are Untogether People' and I had my poem entitled 'What Is Your Thing Brother' [Abiodun Oyewole].  And that was, those were the first three poems that graced the stage as The Last Poets.  And, and we didn't have the name then, the name was something that was sought out by David, David did the research for the name.  He read Sterling Brown's poem 'Strong Men Keep On Coming' ['Strong Men'] he read Margaret Walker's 'For My People' I know he read a poem by Gwendolyn Brooks.  But the poem that really captivated our name finally gave us the name was a poem called 'Towards a Walk in the Sun' by a South African poet named Keroapetse Kgositsile.  And Ko, Ko, Kgositsile, he has I think he does that in his name, he's Zulu.  He's a great brother, good friend of mine, we were in South Africa two summers ago and we had a big party and also when we did our thing on the stage, he came out first.   And the people gave a standing ovation and we started doing the part of the poem that gave us our name, the entire audience was doing it.  So it's like a creed, it was like, "The wind you hear is the birth of memory.  When the moment hatches in time's womb, there will be no art talk.  The only sound you will he- the only poem you'll hear will be the spear, the only sound you will hear will be the spear point pivoted in the punctured marrow.  The only poem you'll hear will be the timeless native son dancing like crazy to retrieved rhythms of desire fading into memory.  Therefore," David added, "we are The Last Poets of the world."  So it's like what all, whatever you know like the negotiations are over.  And the marchings are over, the parade, the banners the shouting and yelling and screaming and throwing bricks and rocks are over you know.  And this statement that we as poets represent is that final statement before it really hits the fan you know so.
Story_ID: 364405
Speaker 1: So that was, and it was like so that, that moment the very first moment was so special.  Because I knew I'd jumped in some waters that were kind of you know deep, and to swim it was challenge you know.  It wasn't nothing you get into college syllabus you know, I'm a be a Last Poet.  And I couldn't see even, even though I knew it was only something that was really, really good and necessary and appreciated, I felt because of the way I was raised that I was cheating in a sense.  Because I was raised to go to college, to become a doctor, I was gonna go, I was gonna be a doctor.  And I think I'd seen a lot of Bernie--I mean a lot of Ben Casey movies and Dr. Kildare movies.  And I think that kind of affected my decision, but I did like medicine, I had a love for it, and I enjoyed science.  I was good at it, and so forth and so it wasn't farfetched, but I was totally disenchanted with the reality of medicine in America.  Because I discovered early on it's really just about drugs and surgery you know, we either cut it off or we're drug you up you know.  And you'll just stay messed up for the rest of your life, and in some cases you know, even die.  So it's, it wasn't, I had some weird impression that being a doctor was gonna make me a healer, I was gonna learn how to put hands and heal you and make you better.  And you gonna never have to worry again, you know I mean I just had a different headset, but that's not a totally out of the realm.  It's just a different understanding of life and so forth, so but I, I college was like a natural.  If you're a good student in high school and everybody thinks you're smart and you got--there's only one place to go you know.  I mean why wouldn't you go to college?   And so it was like and I had choices, I mean I had different colleges that wanted me, so that was cool.  So I wou- I had gotten decent SAT scores, and you know that made it possible for me to get some money.
Story_ID: 364406
Speaker 1: Were you kicked out of that oh home, what was it Ohio State [sic.], what, what?
Speaker 2: No it was Drake [Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa].
Speaker 1: Drake.
Speaker 2: Yeah Drake.
Speaker 1: Or you asked to leave, however you didn't go back (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, I didn't get kicked out, I left, I left.
Speaker 1: You left?
Speaker 2: I left there after that one year, I stayed an entire year.
Speaker 1: But that incident then they didn't--
Speaker 2: Oh that incident that, they, they called me, there were two incidents I called to the office for.  One for throwing my roommate's drawer outside the window, 'cause he used to put his dirty socks and, and underwear and then it the stink was outrageous.  And I came in and I just discovered where this stink was coming from, I took the whole drawer and threw it out the window, bam.  And then when they said I just, I defaced school property, I did some, I tore, and I said man, you couldn't fumigate that drawer.  The drawer was dead (laughter) but that was one incident, I had, so I had some incidents, so Dean Putnam [ph.], that was the dean, he and I, when I left, I'm sure he was happy that I was gone.  But I also brought excitement to the school, I mean I, I did talking about had I done anything else on stage yeah.  I took the role of Deputy Governor Danforth in 'The Crucible' [Arthur Miller].  I took it, because they had walk-on tryouts and I, I was one of the best ones came.  You know I played football, but I was, I, I had all this energy, so I was still bored and I saw walk-on tryouts so I came in.  And Miss Longman [Ruth Farstrup Longman] she was the head of the, the theater department [at Buena Vista College; Buena Vista University, Storm Lake, Iowa], and her and her husband, Mr. [Stanley Longman] and Mrs. Longman.  And, and I said, and I knew I was gonna be the only black person there, I knew that already.  And, and so I said how you gonna determine who gets the part you know.  I sho- I was seventeen years-old, straight up in her face, and she says, says whoever reads the part the best will get the part.  So I said okay, and I knew I could read you know I always could read real well, so that was no problem.  So I, I took a little booklet, and I looked and I said well I can't be John Proctor 'cause he's married to Elizabeth Proctor.  And he got a girlfriend Abigail [Abigail Williams], that's too many white girls for a black man to be messing with in a play in Iowa (laughter) that ain't gonna work.  So I said I can't be John Hale 'cause John Hale likes Abigail (laughter) as a love interest.  I ain't gon be Tituba because she's a woman, even though she's the only black person in the play, she's a slave girl.  I ain't gone be no slave girl, that's out, Deputy Governor Danforth, yeah.  He don't have no affairs with nobody, his job is simply to hang the witches (laughter) and that was me baby, hang them high over the town.  Whoever weeps for them weeps for contemption [sic. corruption].  (Laughter) That's one of my lines.  I, I'll never forget that, I and the guy it was so funny.  The guy that wanted that part his name was John he was a senior and he wanted the part.  Because people coming to see that, that play 'cause it's a big play Arthur Miller, 'The Crucible,' and he was gonna get maybe a little expressway to Hollywood or something.  You would have hopes or Broadway or something, but he had hopes that he was gonna be seen and he was gonna be put on.  So we were competing, I didn't know we were competing for the same part because I already decided that's the only part I can probably get you know.  So when it came time she says you have to read your part, so he read the part first.  And I and he read, he read the same exact section that I had chosen to read you know, and, and that, that was the part that was messed up.  If he had picked another section, maybe it'd been different, but when he did that, he came, he did it before me.  I said oh man, and he, and when he read it, I said oh, I'm going to kill him man, and I mean I went there and rocked it.  And it was no, and that and before I did that, before I did it, I also said about this, I said now I know you said whoever reads the best is gonna get the part.  I said color has nothing to do with it?  She says whoever reads the best, I said I just wanna know, you know.  But I was that bold, I was that bold.  I came right out and asked her because, see I always you see I was never a kid that ever had dreams of being white.  I never had that and I can never understand how any black person, I mean how could we have been beaten that bad? I always felt I had an advantage.

Speaker 1: When I was around the white kids out in Great Neck [New York], I always felt like damn they don't have no color, I got color.  I felt like I had been kissed or something, I never felt for one minute that I had a disadvantage because I was black.  It never, and I know why, my mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis] did that to me.
Speaker 2: How did she do it?
Speaker 1: She, oh she said I was special from the moment she had me.  I mean the moment I became her child, I, I was the most special thing on the planet.
Speaker 2: I know but that okay, you, that is a part of it, but how do you, how do you still, but yeah that's what she gives you at home.  But it maintaining that in a broader society (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I it, it--
Speaker 2: Is telling you just the opposite.
Speaker 1: I know but I had people all around me endorse that (laughter) my homeroom teacher, I had white teachers that, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then how do you, how do you think then you took what they're endorsing was your blackness?
Speaker 1: If, I took, I, I put it this way.  I took it as myself; I didn't even see it as a black thing, I took it as me that they're endorsing me.  That folks like me they think I'm cool, Chucky [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole] got special privileges, I mean I was given the special nod.  I was given the interest into the party, you know it was like I, I didn't, I was not, I was not pushed aside.  I was not pushed out, people wanted me in and they liked my company, they thought I was cool.  And I so I constantly felt good about myself, and being brown was just like at, that was just the reality of who I was.  And I felt good about that, I didn't, I never felt like that was something that I didn't want you know.  I mean something like yeah man I, I mean 'cause you know I was always, I was always on the upside of life.
Speaker 2: Then it must've made you extra angry when it was that thing that you could accept so well that you had to fight the broader society or speak--
Speaker 1: Of course, well, well when I dis, when I, when I when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] got killed I think it all rushed into me like crazy.  Because I'm saying he was killed because he was a black man doing something for black people and that's natural that we should have rights you know.  And how can you, I, I mean I was just taught, I was, and I ferd- I personally I felt personally assaulted by his death.  Because of the fact that here's, here's a black man doing what's natural.  It don't make no sense for people to have to eat in a room that says for colored only don't go.  You can't go to this bathroom, this white's only, you can't eat here, you can't, I mean.  And then my father [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] you know he had already given me a real strong understanding of how we should perform.  He said listen he said my idea is if you know nobody wants me eating in their restaurant then I'll build my own.  Nobody wants me to, to take a, a dunk in their toilet, I'll build my own toilet, you know and he would make that.  He'd say these things and I would hear this all my life.  And, and he sound like a Garveyite without ever having the Garvey [Marcus Garvey] literature, but it was always you know you gotta take care of ourselves.  And then consequently even though I begrudgingly did it as a child, he showed me how to take care of myself.  So that's also another way of making yourself feel pretty good.  I mean we be growing tomatoes better than you gone find in the market, we got the best greens here, we got whatever we need.  The truth is that we don't really have to go to any store, we got everything we need.  And then we got preserve, my mother preserved everything, peaches and tomatoes and, well we had peach (unclear) if, we couldn't go to the store for a year, we straight.  And you know but it was like they these are folks resourceful people knew how to work, knew how to take care of things.  Knew how to, how to build stuff, I mean I know how to do everything.  My hands, I have magic in my hands because my father made me work this, these hands, he made me work.  I didn't want to, I, I didn't want to get my hands dirty, I, I didn't want no dirt under my fingernails all that stuff.  Man he made me have to deal and consequently because I was made to, now I can, and there's nothing in the world that can stop me from achieving anything.  And I know that the only thing that can stop me is me, and so with that understanding, then you and you're drilled that as a kid.  And then as I say you get endorsements, you get people to say yes, hey you know whether it's Chucky or Abiodun it's like yeah, yeah man you can do.  And if the people start relying on you because they know you're responsible, they know you don't mind fulfilling the responsibility.  So you get play, and I got this play early on because the respon- being a responsible person doesn't start when you're eighteen or nineteen, it starts when you're a little kid.  And people start looking at you and say I know I can give him ten dollars to go to the store, he'll bring me back the correct change.  I mean and that's just how my life has always been, and basically I had a, a center in me that's given me focus from, from a long time.  And I know as an older life that I had just coming back and picking up pieces from it but, it's always focused me.  I haven't, I never been scattered.  I never been scattered, I, I had energy going like electrical wire crazy to the point where I had the kind of focus and hone down.  That's what the prison thing was about finally focusing in, and, and zeroing in on what my meditation should be as opposed to not quite understanding that I'm a poet you know for example.  And I think I had to come to grips to that totally when I was incarcerated because poetry is my best companion.
Story_ID: 364408
Speaker 1: Let's go back to--when were you incarcerated?  And time period to The Last Poets.  Okay, The Last Poets you--the group was formed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Last Poets came, the group was born, we are jamming we were doing our thing all over Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: But then how did you meet the jazz musician to put to make the record, the producer?  I mean the, didn't you meet someone who gave you the first album and he had been a producer himself, right?
Speaker 2: No well the first though, the first, the first Last Poets album?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The first Last Poets album came, that, these guys probably been waiting in the wings for a while but see when the group first started, the group first started it was Gylan Kain, David Nelson and myself.  And then we went about trying to get a hold of an accompaniment, but we decided that the accompaniment wouldn't be drums.  But we had to have the right drummer.  So we went to a bunch of, of other instruments even I think a guitar, I went to somebody had some other kind of instrument.  But and then a couple of drummers, we finally got the drummer that we wanted.  This brother had the language, he was perfect and his name is Nilaja [Nilaja Obabi] and so we had our drummer.  So now we got this group, but we had a place called the East Wind [New York, New York].  That made everything possible, because now we could promote ourselves.
Speaker 1: But before you had the East Wind, who's the guy in New Breed that helped (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) New Breed oh, no--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: New Breed, oh, you talking about oh God.
Speaker 1: He had the dashikis, he made the---
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm trying to think of my man's name, I mean, Jason, yeah ooh.  I can't remember his last name but Jason was his first name, and he ran New Breed.  And New Breed was a fantastic clothing enterprise and its uptown here in Harlem they had suits.  I remember the peacock flair suit that this so called split down and just made for black men's butts when they walk they would flair out.  It was outrageous.  We had, and they had the dashiki, they probably, they, they actually popularized the dashiki, that was the big thing.  So everybody had a dashiki behind New Breed.  And they sponsored a lot of the shows.
Speaker 1: But some I read something about you, the models you--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah the models, grandest models I mean they ooh, I mean it was a hot time.
Speaker 1: So he would in, invite you to perform--
Speaker 2: Yeah we performed.
Speaker 1: At--
Speaker 2: At the shows--
Speaker 1: At his shows.
Speaker 2: At his fashion shows, right.
Speaker 1: At his fashion, and then was it you know--
Speaker 2: That was the part, the was a big part of our beginnings because he was hot and he was doing shows all over--
Speaker 1: Now was this before you were formed as a group or this was shortly--
Speaker 2: No, no after--
Speaker 1: You were a group then?
Speaker 2: After yeah.
Speaker 1: You were after okay, so--
Speaker 2: This was after.
Speaker 1: So somehow he heard you and hooked up--
Speaker 2: Oh no he heard us on that first day in the park probably everybody was in the park.  I mean that was a major, major hit you know.  And, and then I mean even got Clayton Riley who did some radio work and new, and he's, and he's got some credits when it comes to media stuff.  He did a major documentary of our very, very beginnings man, I mean he was.  And this cat was on the floor, he was under the table, the cameras and he was whole.  I said this guy is crazy I mean, but he got some hell of, I don't know what happened to that footage.  We had some outrageous footage of us in rehearsing and one of the New Breed spots just getting ready for a gig.  And so we had a lot of hype because people, I mean you know I was, and the thing about it is looking back on it I can, I remember all the hype.  And I remember how people gave us love and stuff, but I was too young, and I felt kind of fraudulent because all these cats are older, they were much older than me.  Like I think what Kain's four or five, well was five or six years.  And if you're five or six years, but especially back then, that's much older.  And David's like eight or nine years older than me.  And, and I was like a kid hanging out so I'm trying to, I'm gonna make something, I wanna get in, I want to be a part of it, but I mean I really have to listen a lot and learn a lot.  I mean I talk, my mouth runs, but the fact is that I didn't think I had the credentials to be the big cheese like The Last Poets were scheduled to be.  Because we were representing a whole lot of interest and New Breed was one, probably one of the major, that was the major interest at the time, the beginning for sure.  And then after that, we got our own place and became totally independent.  We got a place called the East Wind and it was about, I'm talking about all this happened within the span of a couple of months.  And we had a place and then that set us off, because now we're able to produce our own shows.  We're able to do workshops, we're able to sponsor other, oh man, it was, it was really a very special situation.  And I don't know it's just funny how when you're doing stuff, it can be of the utmost importance, but because you're so caught up with whatever the issue is at the moment, you sometimes discard the history.  You, we just don't think like that, 'cause if we did, then the East Wind would still be in existence.
Story_ID: 364409
Speaker 1: And hearing it, it sounds like, like you're, you know you think like that's a time okay Andy Warhol had the Factory [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You had East, what was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) East Wind [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: East Wind.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that's, you did workshops on what?
Speaker 2: Workshop, political workshops Felipe used to have, there would be--I had, I did creative writing workshops.  I did a poetry workshops, Felipe Luciano did political workshops.  You could go to college all day and in the evening; he would have sixty people sit up there and 'til one o'clock in the morning.  After they had been listening to listening to this professor talk about dialectic materialism this, and this and that and the other.  Felipe can break that stuff down; I mean he's one of the best political anal- analis- analysts I ever met.  His mind is ab- he's be, he's brilliant.  And I asked him man, I said Felipe you remember me he says.  And he says yeah I mean, he broke it down, if you didn't understand what capitalism really was, if you didn't understand what, what socialism really was or what communism he would break it down, give you basic examples.  Folks walked out of there enlightened.  National Black Theatre [New York, New York] which now owns that whole block over there on 125th Street and 126th [Street] and 5th [Avenue], she didn't have a place to stay.  For seventy-five dollars a month, she paid rent to us, and came and did her theater there.  And, and had her workshops and stuff, had sometimes there be signs be quiet, we're meditating from six to seven.  I go in and making noise, I just be, I'd so bad, I go in there and hug on Barbara [HistoryMaker Barbara Ann Teer] and say hey I like older women.  I didn't know she was down with it, I was, man please, I was just flirting man, but we had, so that was a big workshop the National Black Theatre.  Now she got her own building, $8 million building.  And we had all kind of great jazz artists; Daron Albert Ira [ph.] came through, Pharoah Sanders, Leon Thomas, Lonnie Liston Smith.  I mean and Cecil McBee, I mean we had the baddest cats come through there.  And, and Sunrise Orchestra performed there, they, I mean and the Amiri Baraka's Spirit House Movers and Players [Young Spirit House Movers and Players], I mean it was Leroi Jones at the time that was his name.  And they came from Jersey [New Jersey], they did workshops, they did plays there.  And was, it was the happening place and poetry was at the hub, and then every weekend if say we didn't even have a special guest, we'd still have a party.  And everybody knew that and the party is always the same thing.  We have the collard greens, potato salad, cornbread, chicken, and, and we have a deejay for the music.  Then we'd stop the music, kick poetry and you go back to the music, and people be eating the collard greens.  I mean it was like it was a real serious gathering and, and then say around one o'clock or so, it might, say might go from anywhere between say one and two it would turn into a drum orgy.  Oh my God, might maybe, it be like maybe twelve, thirteen drummers man, folks, drummers just come out of nowhere, and sit there.  And, and Nilaja [Nilaja Obabi] our conga player he would actually, he was like the maestro, he was the, he would go around and if you wasn't playing the right rhythm, he'd take your hands and make it (makes sound) that he would actually take your hands and make you do that.  And then he'd watch you and make sure you were right on point before he left you alone.  And sometimes he tells people no, no, out man you, you can't no out, you know, says put the drum back take.  I mean he ooh, man and I mean and one time I hung there 'cause I, 'cause I could play the bass drum real well.  So they do samba I love the samba and (makes sound) and, and I had it down and but man these cats just play forever.  I mean so you get that beat all right it sounds just really comfortable once you got it.  And you only done it for a little while, but do that for the next twenty-five minutes, thirty minutes, yeah.  And then go in the bathroom and pee blood, yes, it was like that.  Because you going with tension, you put on your body to keep, keep it going 'cause it's the more you, the more intense it becomes.  And it affects that, that region in your body, and I, the first time I did that I said, "Oh God I'm going to die, oh my God."  He said, "No man, it's natural man, it happens, when you play like you play tonight you know."
Story_ID: 364410
Speaker 1: So we had it was a fantastic experience having our place, and then of course that illuminated The Last Poets.  And I don't know which was bigger at the time; it could've been the East Wind [New York, New York].  Might even been bigger than The Last Poets because we had so many things happening, and it was a Gylan Kain's suggestion name the place the East Wind.  Because he wanted to make it clear that our philosophy even though and it and we happen also to be on the east side between 5th [Avenue] and Madison [Avenue].  But our philosophy was from the east, as opposed from coming from the west.  And that's why named it the East Wind, and then that, that philosophy or that understanding was, was actually par- parroted by the people in Brooklyn [New York].  When they had place called the East and it lasted for quite a few years, and it was just called The East [Brooklyn, New York].  And not the East Wind could've been too much of right, but just The East and, and it was on 10 Claver Place.  And a whole lot of great performances by great jazz artists had been through there.  And, and nobody talks about it, but the only place they could've gotten their idea was from the East Wind.  'Cause we definitely came before that you know, just like the Watts Prophets out in California.  They always wanted say yeah we, we came before you, The Last Poets man we, y'all came after us, we started before.  I said well y'all be older than I am, you older than all of the other cats in the group.  I said that's fine, I said but who wowed the crowd?  I mean (laughter) you know.  The people make that decision; you know you can't judge your success.  The people determine your success in the world we live in.
Speaker 2: So were you making money?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we made enough to take care of the rent and to take care of the needs to keep the East Wind open.  And I'm sure it was a struggle sometimes because I didn't really work in, in that part of it you know.  I was in, I was just a poet and I did, and I had a car, and that was always like a bone of contention with Kain 'cause I, I had my, my bourgeois ways from Queens [New York].  You know I had always had a car, you know I, my, my father [Oyewole's paternal uncle, Joseph Davis] always had two cars you know and so that was natural you know.  Man you, you grow up to drive you know, some people they born on a prairie, they grow up to gallop a horse.  But I grew up to drive a car, and Kain didn't know how to drive at all, he was very jealous of that, and we always had issues.
Story_ID: 364411
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We all had to have other hustles in order to really take care of our needs because there wasn't enough being generated I don't recall from the Poets [The Last Poets] themselves at that time that could sustain us totally.  Because I know I for example had a sweet job, matter-of-fact I think quite a few of us had this sweet job with the Harlem Community for Self Defense.  This is during the same time of the anti-poverty programs, that's how David Nelson and I had first met, and so that went on for years.  Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] had made it, had made it very, he, he made it easy; he made it possible for a lot of black people to get a check for almost doing nothing.  I mean and I was, I was definitely one of them, I mean I was listed as a worker for the Harlem Domestic Peace Corps, what my responsibilities were, I can't even tell you.  All I knew is that every Thursday I went, I picked up a check, and I'm sure that there quite a number of people like that.  I mean Adam, just when they were giving up money to sew for the inner cities. Adam was sitting on that board, and he made sure that Harlem [New York, New York] got a big chunk of change, and we capitalize on that.  So we said that money was for us to fund the revolution (laughter) and we went on and do what we had to do.  And so I never wanted anything, I always had gas in the car, I always had food, everything I needed, and I always had an apartment.  So I never really wanted, and I guess it was a struggle but somehow you know we struggled through.
Story_ID: 364412
Speaker 1: The album ['The Last Poets'], when the album hit money became a focal point and the album came about.
Speaker 2: Go ahead. I'm listening.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when the album came about.  Well Kain [Gylan Kain] had said in the beginning that we should never do an album, because the minute that we do an album is going to create the madness and we're gonna not gonna capitalize on it.  And we're going to lose out because the system is designed like that, and I was whatever, I, I didn't care about that.  I was doing, I felt what we were doing was very important.  So as time went on, the first person to leave The Last Poets was David [David Nelson].  Ironically, he left the group, and he went and actually, he well he left and then he was asked to be out too, because we had this very important con- concert with Sunrise Orchestra and Leroi Junes--Jones [Leroi Jones; Amiri Baraka] the Spirit House Movers and Players [Young Spirit House Movers and Players] and we had sold tickets out and it was gonna be an awesome weekend.  And David said he was going on, on a field trip with his psychology class, and he wasn't going to be there for Friday or Saturday.  Kain said I'm a tell you like the Jew, if you can't to work Monday, don't come Tuesday, and man and I and I had an issue with David about some other stuff.  So I wasn't fe- we weren't like the best of friends right at that moment, and so I voted for him to be out too.  Felipe [Felipe Luciano] was waiting in the wings, he didn't have any poetry but he had talent and he was there, he wanted to be in the group so bad.  And we wanted him in the group, and he could sing, and I knew that that was gonna be a very interesting group, both he and I in the background.  You know we could do so fabulous things and, and did happen, we had, that was without question the hottest Last Poet group in terms of talent.  It was Kain, Felipe and myself, 'cause Felipe had a, has a lot skills, and then and then I sing so we had that versatility.  And then Kain he enjoyed it because he always considered himself the daddy anyway, he thought he was like James Brown and Jesus Christ you know.  Except he didn't wanna walk on water, he wanted to slide across the water you know his whole attitude was like that.  But we had a very nice group, and we did some miraculous things.
Story_ID: 364413
Speaker 1: How did--you were talking about the record ['The Last Poets'] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I was getting to that so what, what happened is when Felipe [Felipe Luciano] and I, and then Felipe started discussing, having a discussion with me about trying to do something about his people.  Because El Barrio was in shambles and there was no organization, there was a lot of things that needed to.  I said you know those your people, I said you need to go to Spanish Harlem [East Harlem, New York, New York] take care of that, which he did.  Started an organization called the Young Lords, which was like a, a Puerto Rican Panther [Black Panther Party] type of thing.  Kain [Gylan Kain] went back downtown to, to the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] where he had been, come, cause he said that he was using poetry as doodling to write plays and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: And, and you just made me think about something, when we go at some point I want you give me each person's like background, what they brought to The Poet [The Last Poets].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I know yours because we've talked about it; you know where Kain came from, where David [David Nelson] came from.
Speaker 2: Well Dav- well Kain brought the aesthetics, David brought romanticism, and, and Felipe brought politics.  Very basic, I mean just like that, and that, that those are, are pillars of The Last Poets.  I mean you know if you don't have this aesthetic, if you do have the romanticism and you don't have the politics, you are not, you cannot possibly be a Last Poet, it's impossible, you know.  And, and you can be that and be a chef (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay so David you, I mean you told Felipe to go take care of his people, he started the Young Lords, you, go ahead.
Speaker 2: And then when David, I mean Felipe went to El Barrio, to Spanish Harlem, Kain went down to the Village, and I was literally left in the East Wind [New York, New York] as the Last Poet.  And that became, and that was scary, because I was young, and I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were still seventeen, no?
Speaker 2: No I'm nineteen, twenty now.
Speaker 1: Nineteen, like twenty.
Speaker 2: I'm twenty years old now.
Speaker 1: Because that went on for--
Speaker 2: I'm twenty years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and you know it's like I can, I'm ,I'm in this and now there's crew, the East Wind Associates, Olumide [Russell Pitchford] and Bootsy [ph.] and Speed [ph.] and all these other cats, we had about six or seven guys that were taking care of the business of the East Wind.  Whether it's the rent, see I didn't know nothing about, so all the business is handled, everybody, we had a crew.  And I love the brothers, they love me, we had a wonderful thing and, and they said, "Well Dun [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole], you the man now," you know and all, all of a sudden.  Now but I I can't be the Last Poet. I'm not gonna run around like that you know, I mean I need to have some more people who would take the place of people gone.
Story_ID: 364414
Speaker 1: So I had a performance at this, at the Allenike Hotel [ph.] was used as a SEEK [Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge] dormitory.  SEEK program was a program they designed for city college [City University of New York, New York, New York] to get blacks and Puerto Ricans in but they had to go through this remediation before they ever matriculated, so.  And they were all put into this SEEK program, I think each of the letters stood for something, and I had a performance at one of their dormitories, one of the places where they would gather, and it was always a, it was like one of the hot spots, whenever The Last [The Last Poets], whenever we showed up it was always crowded.  You know and folks sitting on the tables and stuff, there're no chairs, it's just; we just made it our spot.  So I go down there with just me and the drummer, and and it's just me and Nilaja [Nilaja Obabi].  And everybody, because I got this relationship, everybody's cool with that you know, they ain't upset about that you know.  I said well you know Kain [Gylan Kain] is dah dah dah and so is Felipe [Felipe Lucinao] and everybody's uptight about nothing.  I said, "But we do have this brother here."  'Cause I had gotten Umar [Umar Bin Hassan], Umar had come into town and I'd gotten him a, a spot, to, to sleep in.  Even though he wasn't going to school down there, I knew the sister running the situation, so I said you know my man's from out of town he wants to be a Poet, I said hook 'em up.  Now as I was advertising well here's a brother that came in from Michigan, I mean came from Akron, Ohio.  And he wants to be in The Last Poets and said you, you determine whether or not he's in The Last Poets, he gonna, I let him do something, so he did something.  Anyway he did a poem, he carried a poem called 'Motherfucker' poem and he had a poem called 'Nigger Town.'  And I and he did the 'Motherfucker' poem and it was just, it wasn't even a poem.  He just used it was the way he said the word and he would say and he would have, he would use it like as a an adjective to describe like he'd say, "Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] was a helluva motherfucker, Eldridge Cleaver was a bad motherfucker, Malcolm [Malcolm X] was a mean motherfucker."  And so he, he have this but it was always, every time he say motherfucker it was like a, a rise out of the crowd.  I said to what hey people loved the way he did this whatever and I, and they applauded and said, "Yeah he's in the group."  And I told him then and there, I said, "And you never doing that 'Motherfucker' poem again (laughter) on the stage with me."  'Cause it wasn't poetry, it was just, making these slogan statements about the various leaders that we've had.  It was no variations, it was very you know, but it was his energy and his, the way the pronounced it, that they liked it so the way he said it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And 'Nigger Town'?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: And the other?
Speaker 1: 'Nigger Town,' I, I don't even remember 'Nigger Town,' I don't even think I let him do that, but like he did (laughter) but, but he did.  He was raw and he was passionate, but he was raw and needed some, some work.  That's why I was concerned, and, and so he was in the group, so I would take him around with me, hang out.  We ate at Sylvia's [Sylvia's Restaurant, New York, New York] on a regular, I was you know really like a serious big brother for him.  And since, we even though we were the same age, I just kind of took him under my wings and did what I could do to set him up.  And he did get, I even gave him one of my girlfriends (laughter) that's amazing.  And he, we were getting, and then I wanted to have the other third person in the group.
Story_ID: 364415
Speaker 1: And so there was the other brother that worked for the Harlem Domestic Peace Corps also his name was Ju- Larry Pudim [Alafia Pudim] at the time, and later to become Jalal Mansur Nuriddin.  He, he, I'm a tolerant person and I don't know how many friends Larry had or whatever, but I know I would lend my ear to him, and he would take it.  I mean he would, he'd talk me to death, I mean he'd rhyme everything and he was, he, he just, he and he is also a very aggressive and I said, "Well I'm going to put you in the group [The Last Poets]."  So I mean I, I just he wanted to be in the group, he been wanting to be in the group.  Kain [Gylan Kain] hated him, he said, "Get that nursery rhyming bitch away from me," 'cause he didn't like the fact that he rhymed all his poems.  I thought he was a genius, because I never heard anybody that rhymed that effectively and do it as well as he did.  I mean he was effective and it was, yes it was the only style that he had basically, but it was very effective.  And I loved it, I thought it was great, so and then we actually did a piece together, "Jones Coming Down" ["Jones Comin' Down"].  I mean 'cause I can, I like to rhyme as well, but I don't rhyme as much you know, but I do like it, at certain times you know.  And I'll even rhyme something within the, the framework of a free verse poem of, of a poem that doesn't rhyme.  But just because it's--at that moment, that's what's necessary to create a certain image, a certain sound, a certain atmosphere to, to convince a person that's reading it or hearing it to feel what you want them to feel.  So, so Jalal and I were in a shooting gallery in Brooklyn [New York] and, and we actually saw these sisters and brothers and shoot heroin and, I mean we watched all night long, these brothers and sisters shooting heroin.  And in the morning, we freestyled a poem called "Jones Coming Down," which became a big piece on the first album ['The Last Poets'].  I mean it was like he said a line, I said a, "Day breaks / Got the shakes / Joint dripping / Mind slipping / Body aches / my Jones is coming down on me / Got an attitude / Fighting bad / Feeling sad / Funeral sad / Another 24 hour drag / Damn, I needs me some scag," and we went back and forth like.  We had just seen it and we had been hanging out and the poem, but he, now he cleaned it up, he fixed it up.  And he does it on the album, he's the only voice doing it, but when it was first developed, that's how it was developed.  And it was just classic that we did a lot of stuff like that, a lot of times, poetry would just, because you're hanging out with another poet, and that's already an oxymoron.  I mean poets don't hang together too much, they usually very individual, they're reclusive.  It's like I, it's me and the tree or the plants or the flowers and the cloud or the tears or, or something but not me and some more poets you know.  I mean I see you all on occasion but just to be every waking moment with a, that's crazy you know.  But that's what that, that collective brought about, and that was important.

Speaker 1: So as that now, that group is, is established now, Umar Bin Hassan and Jalal Mansur Nuriddin and myself and now drummer, our trusted, our steadfast brother in Nilaja Obabi which became his spiritual name when he became a Shango priest.  And so the brothers coming East Wind Associates, the crew that was like supporting and helping to keep things going, says it's time for an album.  And I said, "Well Kain [Gylan Kain] said that we shouldn't do an album because it's gonna put us in the middle of everybody's butt you know."  He said, "Man this guy gotta deal it's time first of all man they gotta realize if you do an album the message, you can get the message out in places you cannot even be, you know and everybody will know."  So I said, "Cool," I said, "but you know what?  We not gonna go downtown to audition to nobody."  That much when and that was my, my stand.  My stand was okay y'all say it's time for an album, cool, but if anybody wants to record us, they got to come uptown.  Sure enough that's how Douglas [Alan Douglas] did, he came uptown.  We went to I.S. 201 [I.S. 201, Arthur A. Schomburg School, New York, New York], which is a school, still stands right there on 127nd [Street] and Madison Avenue.  And he, we went up the stairs on the second floor, in a classroom and he and his, his partner Bob Shaffer [ph.] was, I could see it as clear as day sitting there.  And it was just us, and we did your thing two poems, and then he said, yeah, we're ready, we're ready to record you know.  He says now the recording studio is in midtown Manhattan [New York] and he says but it's a very good studio.  He says if you would, if it doesn't offend you, we would like you so I said yeah, yeah.  So we did and we recorded the album a year before it came out.
Story_ID: 364417
Speaker 1: How do you think people saw you as a Last Poet?
Speaker 2: Oh they--
Speaker 1: Militant, no, what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Militant, radical.
Speaker 1: How did you see yourself, yeah radical.
Speaker 2: I saw myself as not as a militant, I saw myself as a, I saw myself as being one of the young guns on the scene in terms of being a young gun with, with the words.  I felt that I had wor- a warrior position just because we were endorsed; we were loved by the people.  And I felt very honored to be put in the upper echelons of, of the shakers and movers of poetry you know.  'Cause that was, that was given to us by the response of the folks, and there was some people who were jealous with that.  And that, and they had, they had to deal with that because the one thing about The Last Poets, we were always in your face. We would never the kind of cats we're gonna pull out a poem on a piece of paper and read to you.  So we had something to say, it was gonna be, and there were quite a few poets who had not graduated to that level yet who were still reading.  And we wiped them out, so I felt like you know we were setting the, setting the tone that was very special in terms of presentation.  And, and the--but I, but I also felt that I was cheating you, you know, I didn't feel like I was really as revolutionary as I should be.
Speaker 1: And you were not because you doing what that made you not (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well because I was just a poet (laughter) I didn't think very much of that, I mean I still, I had too much happening inside of me to just think that could fulfill all of my needs in terms of what I needed to do for me.  I wanted to choke somebody, hurt, I wanted to do some, I wanted to have more hands-on something.  Writing a poem it didn't, that didn't and getting on stage and doing it, people saying yeah brother, black power and hug, that wasn't enough.  I felt very fraudulent and that's one reason why I got out of The Last Poets because I, I mean and I, I did it honorably.
Story_ID: 364418
Speaker 1: How did you do it [leave The Last Poets]?
Speaker 2: Well first of all I started realizing that, that Jalal [Jalal Mansur Nuriddin], the last person I had put into to make, to make the trilogy was star struck, he, he really wanted to be a celebrity.  He was, he had the wrong idea what being a Last Poet was about so I choked him at a gathering, I, I mean I really, I just, I wanted to hurt him.  Because he was disavowing the very reason why The Last Poets were born.  He said man we can be bigger than Miles Davis. I knew Miles Davis (laughter) I had dinner with Miles; I mean used to go with Marlena Franklin [ph.], Cicely Tyson's daughter [sic.].  I know Miles, I met Miles, I mean Miles is cool, I love Miles.  But Miles is an entertainer, we were revolutionaries.  I mean and Mi- and Miles has a revolutionary thoughts and things that he did with the horn, there's no doubt, but he, but we were coming from a different place.  Miles was a part of the decades and many ways you know and I couldn't see you know that this being like Miles, and so I was upset with that.  And put my hands on his throat and I realized at that moment that he did not see the big picture.  He was, he was coming from an ego place, where he wanted to be a star, he wanted to shine, and that wasn't what The Last Poets were about.  And, and at that moment I think at that moment in Nilaja's [Nilaja Obabi] house when I put my hands on Jalal I think that's when I started thinking I got to get to get out of this group.  Because now, I'm the, I'm the older guy in the group, even though Jalal's older than me age wise and, and Umar [Umar Bin Hassan] is my age.  I mean I started the group with David [David Nelson] and Kain [Gylan Kain] and even though it's been months they been the longest months of my life, and I'm ready to go.  'Cause you know this thing is not going the route, and nobody knew today was gonna be here (laughter) you know that that the Poets were gonna be like woo you know.  So that, none of that was clear in my head, and but I just wanted to do more, I wanted to do more.
Speaker 1: Who was starstruck when you just?
Speaker 2: Jalal.
Speaker 1: Jalal, okay go ahead.
Speaker 2: You know so--
Speaker 1: You just wanted to do more right?
Speaker 2: Yeah I wanted yeah.
Story_ID: 364419
Speaker 1: And so I, and I had an opportunity and opportunity came when the sisters in the organization called the Harlem Community for Self Defense who had been doing research on land encroachment by, by the government and like everything that's happening now.  Thirty, thirty-five, years later, thirty-eight years later they predicted this isn't new all that going down right now about what the plans for Harlem [New York, New York] were.  And they were trying to stop it then, and the state office building was one of the first structures put up to set this thing off.  And that was done in '69 [1969] and we stopped it from going up on July one and we kept, we, we're squatting on the land.  I renamed the land Reclamation Site Number One; we put the red, black and green flag.  They cut the rope down so we couldn't put the flag back up then they greased the poles so the brother that climbed up there.  We had a brother climb up there and put the flag up there, brother greased the pole, and they say, I mean they greased the pole.  So the brother couldn't climb, they un- the brother ungreased the pole, climbed up there and put the flag back up there.  If you go over there to 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] right now, 125th Street you will not see a flag pole 'cause they cut it down, they took it down.  Say, "That's how you black folks gonna do, we, we grease the pole, you gonna find a way up and ungreased it and go up there?"  And I told some people at another interview recently I said I wish I had the, the chemic powers that we once had of levitation, so we could put the flag back up there anyway.  Without the pole and watch them freak out you know, but the deal is that, yeah so that was a hands-on Last Poet [The Last Poets] job for me.  The, Marlena Franklin [ph.], the sister I mentioned briefly who happened to be, who happens to be Cicely Tyson's daughter [sic.], she says, "Abiodun [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole] I want you to go to the Bronx [New York] market and get as many watermelons as you can in, in your car."  I had a 1967 beige Impala, 4-door.  I got thirty-nine watermelons, I had thirty-eight and the guy that was putting them in the car for me, he help me put them in the car.  He said you sure you got enough watermelons, and I looked and I said no give me another one.   And he, I put the last one the thirty-ninth on my lap and I drove back to the site on 125th and 7th, that's 'cause it was just all fenced in.  The buildings had been knocked down, and they had planned to come in the next morning, that July one and start the excavations, this is June 30th so.  But we not gonna let them do that 'cause we got this demonstration, and we gonna stop this shit, and the watermelons are a part of it.  Tear out the watermelons the sisters cut them bad boys up, they made a makeshift table, it must've been two thousand slices of watermelon they had.  Of course people came off from the street onto the site, we got the fire going on, we got the drums playing, we got our chants.  I was supposed to be at the East Wind [New York, New York] doing my, my poetry workshop, and my guest poet on that particular day was a brother named [HistoryMaker] A. B. Spellman who was a very well-known poet out of Atlanta, Georgia, A. B. Spellman came when he found that I was not at the East Wind and I was down on the site at this spot.  He came down there and he got on the bullhorn and did his poetry, I mean it was fabulous.  I mean it was a wonderful moment in time, and the zeal of the evening, some of our young brothers got crazy and they burned up a little cheese bus that was there.  Which was probably gonna be used for the workers, and I'm thinking if we have to stay here, it will be protection, but the niggers burned the damn bus up.  I mean it pissed me off, I said, Lord have mercy, because I'm thinking ahead, 'cause something can happened, and sure enough something happened.  I mean the something that happened was when we put the fire out, 'cause that was crazy, it also dangerous.  You know to have the bus burning right there and everybody there, but in the morning no bulldozers.  Rockefeller [Nelson Rockefeller] wasn't stupid, he said I know this is riot season, black folks riot every summer during the '60s [1960s] and now they gone have a big grand riot because I'm trying to build a state office building [Harlem State Office Building; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building, New York, New York], naw, let the niggers stay there for a while.  And when they all, and most of them gone go back to college in September then we'll go busting in there and build the building.  So my man looked at me 'cause now I mean I'm been using my big mouth to rally people because people know I'm a Last Poet and blah, blah, blah, and I'm.  And the sisters they not running they mouths they just organizing but they needed a big mouth person, so I, that was the big mouth.  And, and my man looks at me he says, "Yo man, it's seven o'clock man, what you gonna do?"  I said, hm 'cause we expecting the bulldozers to be there like early.  You know at least the machines would get there and the workers get there later or whatever.  And we didn't see any and said oh shit they pulled a fast one on us, there's no, and we got all these people ready for confrontation, we got sticks and stone everything whatever you gonna you know.  Ain't no confrontation, so I said, so I saw, and it was at that precise moment I saw the parks man take, bringing the red, white and blue flag to put it up, to hoist it up.  And I said, "Let's get the flag, I said get that little red, black and green flag and get--," and we took the little red, black and green flag we had and ran out there and snatched the red, white and blue flag, and took the red, black and green and hoist the bad boy up, I said, "This is Reclamation Site Number One."  I said, "That's what we're calling this; we're reclaiming our land, and we're starting with this."  Oh man, it was outrageous.
Story_ID: 364420
Speaker 1: And then I had a canvas across the st- the little burnt out cheese bus and we put the speaker on top of the, of the bus so that and I, and we had the system inside so I could talk to the people going to work or at lunchtime in the evening to explain why we were there, what we wanted, what we were, we.  We don't need state office building [Harlem State Office Building; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building] in Harlem [New York, New York] we need a high school.  That was the chant we, we don't have no central high school in Harlem in that area.  And we needed that and the history that exist on that corner will just make that, that public high school there very vital.  Plus we want a multiservice center for health services and so forth, and we had that laid that.  And we had a black architect design exactly what we wanted, and this is our community so we took total charge.  And it was, it was a beautiful movement, we never gonna happen 'cause we don't, we don't own Harlem (laughter) I mean bottom line is that the powers that be did what they wanted to do.  That's why, the State Office Building is up there, and it serves no purpose.  People think that Bill Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] in that building, he's not in that building; he's nobody's in that building.  That building is just there, it's a big phallic symbol just to let you know that Harlem is not that black you know.  It's run by some other people with a different complexion and persuasion.  So that was an issue but we fought and that was a great fight, but it, and it las- it took me out of The Last Poets but it put me into the fast lane of, of activity, because from then on I was like a, I was just active.  I was doing stuff (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you become more involved with run-ins with the police because you moved from being a poet to--?
Speaker 1: Well, I had a--yeah, I mean that definitely was the case because I mean first of all my car was going on and off the land every day, I mean and, and anybody with any half a brain could've eventually figured out that they were definitely come and get my ride you know.  And, and it just happened (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did they?
Speaker 1: Yep and that, that caused me to have to leave Harlem and get out of here because, and it was on a day when the Yorubas had come to the site to bless it.  And so you got all these brothers and sisters in the African garb and it was a lot.  And with the drummers that they had they just created an even more of a turnout, 'cause now everybody and their mama wants to know what's going on?  So we had like I don't know at least two or three thousand people on the land.  And this ceremony was to be taking place to bless the land and all that stuff.  We had created a road called Liberation Road [ph.].  That went from the middle of debris just so there was a clear path for us to travel, 'cause it was a lot of debris from 7th [7th Avenue; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] all the way to Lenox [Lenox Avenue; Malcolm X Boulevard] you know.  And 'cause that's how much space it was.  And we had built some makeshift dwellings, we had people standing, I mean mostly homeless I mean it was amazing.
Story_ID: 364421
Speaker 1: And, and the brother gets on the microphone and says, "Abiodun [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyweole] come to the mic."  Now if you say my name like that with all the people around that I just described, I'm not the only one that's gonna be alarmed.  You know even though your name ain't Abiodun you know, so I'm alarmed because of the way you called my name.  Everybody's alarmed, so I go running to the mic, and there's like a million ears that are right there with me to find out what's going on?  They got your car man, the car, they got, it's at Park Avenue, 125 Street [New York, New York], and then, and they beat up the brother in it and he needs to go to the hospital.  And they ain't taking him, and I'm like oh shit, and but now I'm gone be very honest the thing that hit me the biggest than anything, I mean it might be wrong was my ride man. I mean I care about the brother but man I mean oh my horsey oh been snatched.  I mean I was upset man, I'm gone be very honest with you man I cannot, I cannot accept the fact that these people have taken my car.  So without thinking strictly functioning on the material goods, I run out, off the land and I start heading down towards Park Avenue on 125th Street.  I mean you know, I'm, I'm and, and without thinking and I looked behind me, there must be a thousand people running with me.  Must be at least and we get down to 125th and Park, I see my car right there under the el I see the policemen standing around it.  And I stopped and, and well the brother, one of the brothers with me stopped me from going to the car directly and, and I see all these people.  And this one brother is saying who I did not know.  He said, "Yo man it's a bunch of us, we can get 'em now man, we can get 'em now, this is the time, let's get 'em now."  And, and I'm thinking to myself, I'm not, I'm not even thinking about nothing, I'm looking at my ride.  I would like to get my ride, but a full scale riot to get, I mean a lot of things happening but before I could even really figure out anything that's going on, I, maybe it was the second time he said we can get 'em now.  A fist came out of no place and knocked this brother out, bam knocked him to the ground bam, and he was out, not moving.  And I looked at my man, he says he's a, look he says he's a junkie and he's working for the police, he says look up top on the el.  Here the riot police with their guns aimed right down at us, it would've been a massacre.  It we had bumrushed them cops I wouldn't be here to tell you this story, we turned around.  But then I start thinking left the site [Reclamation Site Number One] unprotected, I said we got to get back.  Man we tracked made it back to the site man we made it back, now it's the case of my car, what happened to Stevenson [Robert Stevenson (ph.)], we got a Jewish lawyer to make sure that they allowed him, to get they took him out of the precinct.  And they took him to Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] he had a concussion and his arm was broken, and they had just thrown him in the jail cell.  Then they said they found guns and, and they said they found some--
Speaker 2: Weed.
Speaker 1: Bullets.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they found drugs they said they found drugs and bul- bullets and a gun.  I had my gun with me, I had a .38 snub nose special, they could not have found a gun in my car unless they put it there.  And any shells that they may have found, they put there too, 'cause I had my shells with me as well 'cause I know what I'm doing, I know we on this land illegally and anything can happen, and if it's gonna be a fight I'm gonna go out with my gun, very basic.  And I had a .38 sub nose special that was baby back then.  I don't own a water gun now, I don't, I, I have nothing to say, there's nothing good I can tell you about a gun.   But at that time that was part of the, the wardrobe, that was a part of the deal, and, and at that point, and when the O- when Olumide [Russell Pitchford] yeah the brother that he was he had been the manager of The Last Poets he was a very good friend of mine he was the one that told me that was a spy.  And, and he knew he was a junkie, and he had seen him coming out of the precinct.  And he, and, that, that was a set-up, anyway we got back to the site and the, and secured the place, but now I'm hot.  Now that you know of course the community is saying like you know they gonna have a reason to come on this site because they got your car.  And they can say all these things were found in it so that will give them a reason to va- to vamp on this site you know.  So I realized that.
Story_ID: 364422
Speaker 1: The very first night when he arrived and the when he to, when he got uptown but the--
Speaker 2: Was he sitting in the car when they, is he the guy they took to the hospital, no, was he the same guy that was sitting in the car when the police picked the car up on Park Avenue [New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The guy that, that was in the car when they got--I had mark, I had loaned my car to, I would loan my car to a number of people to go get things that were donated to us.  Like food, you know we're squatting on this land [Reclamation Site Number One]; we need things donated to us.  Food, medical supplies, clothes, whatever, and so there was, somebody was donating some stuff and this brother's name was Robert Stevenson [ph.].  I don't know if his middle name was Louis, but he's, his first name was Robert Stevenson.  He had borrowed my car, he was one of my boys, you know one of my lieutenants or whatever.  And I gave him the keys to go get what, whatever it was he was supposed to get, and it was a quick run and come back, no problem.  And I, you know I had done this before, it was no big thing, and this particular occasion the cops come to get my ride and decided--and at, and they, and I, and I, don't believe, and I think honestly that they thought it was me driving my car you know.
Speaker 2: So what happened, did you get back to the site, you secured the site but the people say now they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, I'm hot, I gotta go, I gotta go.  So I had to plan getting out of New York City [New York, New York] and I had a wife [Biji Davis (ph.)] and a kid [Pharoah Davis] at the time.  I sent them down to, to North Carolina because I had; I had made some plans to go down to North Carolina anyway.  I mean was a possible plans, it wasn't really certain, but now it's like most certain I'm going to North Carolina 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it was that serious then you--
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh I had to get out of town.
Speaker 2: You had to get out of town--
Speaker 1: Yeah I had to get--
Speaker 2: And it wasn't as simple as oh, I can get a lawyer to take care of these issues?
Speaker 1: No, no, no because they want, you see the thing is that I found out later on from my a- from my personal FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] agent by the way, when I was in prison I met him.  He, they, they just really wanted me out of New York, 'cause I was paranoid for a little while.  Thinking that even though I'm in North Carolina it's still America they can get me, they can pick me up.  Nobody was looking for me in North Carolina; they just wanted me out of New York.  Because you see as I said, you didn't see me, but you heard me every morning, noon and night.  And I'm galvanizing this, I mean this site is, we got this thing rocking and rolling, I'm explaining to the people why we there.  I'm talking to them, I getting them donating money, I'm getting them to be more political; I'm, I'm--matter of fact, one of the things I had done was probably the most prominent thing that I recall was they put all black policemen around the site, that block.  7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] down Lenox [Lenox Avenue; Malcolm X Boulevard] so you see twos and threes black cops, so like yeah, we, we blow you away you know.  We're here to--the interest of the state or whatever and y'all are radicals and yeah, we black like y'all, but we ain't on the side.  And the brothers, and at the time the expression was off the pig, and--
Speaker 2: Off the who?
Speaker 1: Off the pig, the cop was the pig, and that was a known expression during the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] early '70s [1970s], off the pig.  That's you see the Panthers [Black Panther Party] when they have a demonstrations they had a chant, "off the pig, off the pig" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You mean kill the cop?
Speaker 1: Kill the cops.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  So the people who, that were coming down there were sym- sympathetic towards our being there, they would sometimes harass the cops.  And they see them there and they would not sometimes, but all the times they say you fucking pig, you black pig.  And we have some people that would just getting on their cases like that.  And I saw this happening, now I had my, my normal routine of talking to the people.  The morning and the noon and at night, to inform them, you gotta keep them informed, and that was our communication network.  I got on that mic and I said brothers and sisters do not harass the brothers in blue, if the ship breaks they know who to aim their guns at.  They are our brothers, they will not kill you or me, they know who they are.  They're just working a job do not harass the brothers in blue, they are our brothers, they are only working as police officers.  They will protect us, they will not harm us.  The next day, every cop was white, every cop was white.  So the power of the word was still living and I mean I'll never forget that, that it was like they say this guy convinces the, our cops to go up against us with these radical fools.  No, get rid of the black cops; bring in some cops that won't listen to that shit.  It was, it was amazing, it was amazing, so that, I can tell from that alone, I was a problem.
Story_ID: 364423
Speaker 1: So you were a revolutionist as opposed to an entertainer?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, no question and I found my, I found my space, and then when I got out of North, out of New York [New York] and went down to North Carolina, it be, it, it grew, grew, grew.
Speaker 1: Why do you think what you, I want, we'll go back to the North Carolina, but why do you think now you, it is seen?  And I don't, I mean maybe entertainment is the wrong word, but it's definitely like an art form something people, people are coming out to see you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: As more than just to hear the message, to see the delivery, to see the performance, to see the man who created the--do you know why you think it's that now as opposed--and, and how does that feel to you now it's become what the guy said, star struck.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well you know I, I people have var- various reasons for why they come out and see us.  But I'm going to still be who I am you know and I'm never gonna be untrue to me.  So I'm always gonna be political, I'm always gonna have something to say about the treatment of my people, I'm a always be clear.  And I'm always championing causes and things and things of this nature that I feel, and I'm a always take a chance and say something that maybe somebody might consider risque.  Because that's just how I, I feel about things, and I, I'm not gonna hold back, I think I'm respectful, I'm a try to be as respectful as possible.  But some things I might say that might be considered disrespectful to others, so be it.  I'm willing to take whatever the consequences are.  We are living in the circus; America has become Disney World, the whole America.  Entertainment is something that happens from the time you get on the train at 125th 'til the time you go to 59th Street [New York, New York].  I mean everybody's entertaining, entertainment is what we been groomed, that the TV charac- TV has over two hundred channels, three hundred channels.  I mean it's, it's a part so people are looking forward, it's become, it's almost like a drug.  It's like if I'm, and if I'm not entertained the way I like to be entertained I got so many choices I can be entertained some other way.  But I or create a perverted entertainment, but I've got to be entertained.  I gotta be catered to and that's a way, that's how America, America is a little kid, and that's what kids need.  They need new lollipops, new gum to chew, new candy to suck, and that's what this country's become.  And that's all it's become, and it's not maturing, it, it is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But what does it do?
Speaker 2: War is entertainment.
Speaker 1: What does it do the revolutionist when--
Speaker 2: Well you know it makes--
Speaker 1: The, the what yeah, but what you become--
Speaker 2: It keeps--
Speaker 1: A paid, not you paid--
Speaker 2: Now I--
Speaker 1: But we've come to be--
Speaker 2: The reva- the reva--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The revolutionist never changes, you be on course, you stay on the course that you are about and that's about change.  If you're a real revolutionist, no matter what department you're in, it doesn't have to just be poetry.  It can be some other area, it can be architecture, it can be carpentry, it can be any area.  But if you see change is a part of your mentor, as a part of your mantel and that you know that change might be considered radical by other people's standards.  But it's a change that has given you spawn in your life and made you believe in who you are as a person.  You never, ever give that up, you give that up.  If you have found something that works that speaks your name that's got your breath attached to it, that you have shared with others and they've appreciated it.  Even though it was considered like maybe not a part of what we consider a safe and sound right now.  I mean I, I'd say go for it you know, and we have to 'cause spine is something that some of us are lacking.   And right now and people have been beaten, and fear factor is, is playing such a role in how people are functioning is very, very sad.  Because if you're afraid, then you won't do what you're capable of doing and it restricts you.  And the one thing that I, I definitely can never abide by is fear, I think that all the changes that I went through were to finally show me the proper weapons to use and how to use the weapons that I had.  Because as I, and when I was a kid, I, I knew that had to have a gun, I thought that was part of it, you know I'm, I'm one with this change.  And I know that I'm living in violence and this everything is predicated on violence, so I got my gun.  I'm ready for whatever, boom.  But then I realize I got something much bigger than a gun, but I had to go through a whole bunch of changes to know that I'm walking around with weapon that can melt down a gun without it ever being pulled out of the case.  I mean it's like, it, it, you; you grow to understand who you are if you're searching to discover that you know.  Of course there are some of us who are not searching, so they'll never know.  And it's frightening if they ever discover it because we still are the biggest mystery in the planet to ourselves, so.

Speaker 1: So what happens to you and the Carol- in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well what happened in North Carolina I went down there gung ho man, I mean I was ready to change everything, plus now I'm in Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] land you know I'm where the Klan is.  And I saw the Klan marching (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you see more to change down there than you saw--
Speaker 2: I saw--
Speaker 1: With the state building [Harlem State Office Building; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: I saw, you know what I saw--
Speaker 1: On 125th Street?
Speaker 2: I compare my experience at Drake University [Des Moines, Iowa], which was white, now I'm at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] which is black.  So I know you all understand where I'm coming from, and it was not that easy, that's what really set me off.  And it took me right black to why The Last Poets were even created.  Because we were created to inform black people of how to be black and strong, and to stop being niggers basically, that's one of the underlying themes throughout all of our work.  Don't be a nigger, be black and strong you know.  All right now here I am in a place where I'm expecting folks to be black and strong, but they're niggers, and so that was the major fight, major challenge.  So now, I'm, I'm and I'm not just nouveau aware of my African culture, I've finally adopted my name, and I got the African clothes on.  And everything has got to be African, African, African, I got African centric everything, everything is.  If you not wearing African clothing and you teaching African studies, I'm a crack on you.  You gotta get them cracker clothes off you, you can't teach Africans if you still wearing those cracker clothes.  I mean I was hard, I was hard, I had a Yoruba society, I'm br- I'm busting up the, the fraternities and sororities.  The fraternities they got their deal step, I bring out my drummers and dancers and wiped them out.  And we just, just (makes sounds) and I have my dancers and we kill them.  I say no, we, we got African societies, we don't need Greek fraternities, and I would break it down.  We should have a Yoruba society, an Ashanti society I'd break it all down I say Watusi society, I said we got all of that at our disposal we don't need this Greek bullshit.  And I would make speeches, I--impromptu speeches in the union, on the cafeteria.  Stand on top of the table in the cafe- I mean it was crazy, but I was full throttle, I was full steam ahead.  We're gonna change and this is gonna be my, this is, I mean I took over the school, I was, I, I got three A's for not coming to class, because I was that much of a radical in the classroom, I went to Behavioral Science, my Behavioral Science teacher said listen I don't want you, 'cause I you can have an A.  She says you're very well-read and you know a lot and I appreciate when you say things that I can appreciate.  But you know you, you're killing my syllabus I, I, and I, I said, "Well you're teaching on the wrong syllabus." I said Will [ph.] and Skinner [B.F. Skinner] are not the people that we should be learning about.  I said because they're white guys who behavioral scientists, everybody's born inherently evil.  And I said in our social scientist and you need the find who they are E. Frank Frazier [E. Franklin Frazier], I said they don't think like that.  I said we are born with good, look if we weren't this county would've been knee deep in blood; and I would always tell her that.  I said this country been in knee deep in blood a long time ago, if we weren't born good.  You said we're born evil if we were, you'd be dead, and so we argued about it all the time, all the time.  And she finally just said please, and after I think second or third, only two or three classes I went to.  And she said, "Please, you got an A, don't come to class--"
Story_ID: 364425
Speaker 1: So I spent all of my time in the, in the radio station and I had two super radio programs.  And I and I learned how to operate the radio booths--
Speaker 2: Tell me about the two programs.
Speaker 1: Oh it was called 'Variations Phase One' [ph.] and 'Variations Phase Two' [ph.] and I had, this is actually before I, this is--well what happened is I this was when I was in the joint [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina] and I came out on study release is when I got into the radio program, a really--and I was taking classes [at Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], I mean because I had have, that's in order to be out, you know I had to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You had to do, go to school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: And, and or either work release which would mean working as a waiter or something at the governor's mansion [North Carolina Executive Mansion, Raleigh, North Carolina].  And that would've been ooh (laughter) I can't see myself do that (laughter) but either the fact is that when I was, when I set-up the radio station after I got all this permission since I didn't have to go to class (laughter), I stayed at the station and I had, and I started thinking how I can be effective to the brothers over at the joint.  Because you know there are certain things that they couldn't read you know.  So I, I actually programmed 'Native Son' [Richard Wright] fifteen minute segments of 'Native Son' every day on my 'Variations Phase One' show.  And on 'Variations Phase Two' I program fifteen minutes segments of 'The Spook Who Sat By the Door' [Sam Greenlee].  And then I would pro, my, my PA announcement for this show as and the next time somebody ask you have you read a book lately you can say yeah, I read a book lately.  Even though somebody is reading it to you, you know.  So I, and I would, I would change my voice up, I'd find the, right music, you know I had fun finding the music.  I used John Coltrane; I used all kinds of music in the background while I'm doing the parts and stuff.  And so I had fun just creating a whole radio show you know.  And, and because it's college you got much more leeway than you got on commercial radio.  So and, and then I would do some of my poetry and did some other poets, some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How old were you at the time?
Speaker 1: Oh I was twenty-one, twenty-one years old [sic.].
Speaker 2: How did they get--
Speaker 1: Twenty-two.
Speaker 2: What charges--
Speaker 1: Twenty-two.
Story_ID: 364426
Speaker 1: What charges (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Twenty-two.
Speaker 1: Did they get you on to go--?
Speaker 2: Well what happened is when I started this organization, I was challenged by some young men, they said--
Speaker 1: Which organization?
Speaker 2: The Yoruba society.
Speaker 1: Okay, the one you took (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Yoruba society, when I, when I went--
Speaker 1: Down south--
Speaker 2: Yeah went down south and I set-up the Yoruba society at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].  And I'm the radical on campus and got everybody Africanizing everybody, everything, and, and bringing the drums out and just doing my thing.  So I had these brothers who wanted to be a part of the organization, but their whole, they, they were much more militant in language than I was.  It was and suppose the police vamped on you all, how you gone protect yourself from the police, where's your guns?  I said anybody can get guns, I said that ain't no big thing; I said we work on our culture you know.  I mean and, and so "You got bulletproof dashiki?" or you gonna knock somebody out with your afro?" you know.  It was all those kinds of jokes, so in my, one of my rash responses to one of the, the funny jokes was that you know getting guns is nothing, that's easy.  And now when I said it, then now it's about producing.  So I, with the help of some of my other brothers in the, in the organization, we designed a little plan to rip off the two gun shops that still exist in Raleigh [North Carolina].  Thorns [ph.] and Dixie's [ph.] were the two gun shops and the plan worked wonderfully except that one of the, and there's the two big mouth brothers as always is the case.  They dropped the duffle bag full of guns after they had gotten successfully the guns you know from this particular place.  Because they heard a noise and then they came back, and now we, and we were, we were actually--
Speaker 1: They dropped the duffle bag full of guns?
Speaker 2: Yeah and came back to Meserve Hall, now Meserve Hall is where we were stashing the weapons and that happens to be the basement of the president's mansion.  And that's where we did the newspaper so we owned that area, 'cause I had taken over the newspaper.  So the guns that's where they were bringing, the guns, so when Bubba [ph.] and Marshall [ph.] came back and they had no guns, everybody was cracking on them.  Because they were, they were the main cats you know talking all that shit, so.  So then they felt embarrassed and they went back to get, to retrieve the duffle bag with a guy who was a spy, and I didn't know, in the organization.  And that's how they got busted.  So that morning when I came on campus Rev- Coach Clemmons [ph.] the football coach, he says to me, he said, "Abaduba [ph.]," he always used to mess up my name.  He says, "Your boys's in jail."  I said, "What?"  He said, "Got three boys in jail.  Stealing guns and the cops getting a, a warrant to come on the campus to get, find the rest of the guns."  So I said, "Oh man," (laughter) so I started giving guns away to everybody I knew (laughter) that want, that liked guns, I was like Santa Claus man, I was giving guns to people.  And I had so many he said, "(unclear) with the cops.  You get all the guns."  It was a lot of guns, we had sold a lot of stuff.  And I didn't think we could get all that stuff out, and, and we, and well we got it out.  Nobody, they didn't find nothing when they got there, but now I got Bud [ph.] and Marshall [ph.] and McCoy [ph.] was the other person.  I'm saying but I thought it was four people that left, and that's when I realized aw, ain't that a bitch?  So they just there're three in jail, and there were four people who left when we went to retrieve the guns.  So we got over by James McCoy's his name, that's his name, that's the name, I remember his name.  He, I, I called his mother, his mother bailed him out, mother got him out.  I felt so embarrassed too 'cause that's when we realized that we were still kids you know?  Gotta call your mom, see you got in trouble doing something old bad something you know rev- you old grown up act you know you can't even protect yourself.  But and then Bud and Marshall I knew that they had some, something waiting for them back in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  It was only a matter of time before they would be extradited you know if, if that old one kicked in you know.  So let's get them out before that kicks in, you know that was my thing you know.  And because they were in my organization I felt responsible, and I just come up with the idea to get this done.  Even though they were big mouths that set it off, I still felt responsible for them.  And I was trying to get them out, and I went to King Cheek [HistoryMaker King V. Cheek, Jr.] he was the president of the time of Shaw University.  He said he was gonna the out; Cofield [ph.] was our guy that bailed everybody out when everybody got in trouble.  He was gonna talk to Cofield, they gon bail them out, it was gonna be fine.  I got back over there about three or four hours later, his wife says he went to Detroit [Michigan], so I said he lied to me you know.  He ain't even thinking about the brothers, they gonna rot in there.
Story_ID: 364427
Speaker 1: So then I figure okay, I, I gotta do what I gotta do.  So I remember of where this, this white radical kid from SDS [sic. Students for a Democratic Society] had told me about where they, the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] had tried to recruit him like a previous summer.  Because he's a white boy, they didn't know he was, he would, he would, he liked black people.  Or he ain't figure he wanna hang niggers like they want to hang niggers.  And they, and he hated them for that, and he told me about where they had their headquarters, 'cause they brought him there, the fed him, they treated him like family and everything.  And he said man we should torch that fucking place you know we just go there and torch it.  And for one brief moment, I was willing to do that, but then I said, no I never did nothing like that, done nothing like that at all.  And I never did it with a white person, I said, "Naw, I'm not gonna take a chance," but I remember where the place was.  So I'm thinking if that's their meeting place, they gotta have dues that got money.  It was a filling station, a store, a lodge a few things, and they did have money.  And I pick, I, I figured it out, so that's where me and Alex [ph.], my co-defendant went to rob the Klan.  And I figure I'd kill two birds with one stone, rob the Klan, embarrass them to death and get my boys out of jail.  So we went and robbed the Klan, but the problem is the plan got all messed up because two, a Pepsi-Cola [PepsiCo] truck drove up near the, the filling station.  Right by at the filling station, they got out and they came into the lodge, they didn't come in the store.  They came where we were coming out of and, and that was unexpected.  Alex one said, "Should we lock them up in the storeroom?"  'Cause we locked the other cats up in the storeroom.  They had kidnapping charges on us, but we didn't kidnap anybody, we locked them up on the premises, we didn't take nobody with us.  Anyway they came in and then when they realized I guess the guys were banging on the door whatever, 'cause we were gone.  They ran out to the same Pepsi-Cola truck and pulled out rifles and started shooting at us.  And so we saw oh shit, we are down south (laughter) and we're running, but we had guns, and we turned and we fired back.  And we fired back, we didn't hear no more noise, and it was weird because now we're in the woods.  So it was a manhunt for about six hours, had to bury the money, I mean it's a telluva--it's a helluva story.  I mean it was a serious manhunt, and we came out without a scratch, and I didn't get beat, neither Alex nor I got beat up, in the jail cell or nothing.
Speaker 2: Did an- was anyone shot?
Speaker 1: Nobody was shot, nobody got hit, and, and I we thought we'd killed somebody because we, they fired at us, and we were running and then we both kind of ducked behind a tree.  And then we, said, I said, "Man we got guns man."  So we got took out my shit, boom, I fired, he fired and we didn't hear not one sound.  And we said ooh, and I'm thinking I said, "Man I might've killed them suckas man."
Speaker 2: Well I, well I will bet that's the first time those Klansmen ever had any black man shooting at them.
Speaker 1: Probably so.
Speaker 2: They probably thought--
Speaker 1: That might've been the case--
Speaker 2: Them blanks are crazy.
Speaker 1: Yeah it might've been the case because I, and I thought about the second minute, because the initial reaction was to run you know.  When we first saw the, when saw them pulling out the rifles and why, 'cause I looked back and then I saw them fire.  I said, "Oh shit man."  We were like being fired upon.  And the thing about it is that they didn't, they had--all right they got everybody involved, the state troopers, the sheriff's department, the good people.  And they had a plane up in the sky that whenever it was over us, it would do like that (gesture) to let them know that we're over them right now.  So the thing that saved us, that gave, that gave, that saved us really was a whole section of evergreen trees.  Because it was thick enough for you not to be able to see, and we even chilled there for about a good maybe thirty minutes, a whole, a whole section was like--
Speaker 2: I've always wanted to know I mean this doesn't, has nothing to do with making history, but just to and then what, what are you thinking those six hours when you're, you're, you're being chased down like that?
Speaker 1: Well, I, I--
Speaker 2: But like what is the conversation I mean between the two of you?  Do you joke, do you cry, do you, you what?
Speaker 1: I had a fit of laughter, I was losing my mind, I know that at one point and it was when we got to the pine, we where I buried the money and, and when I say 'cause I knew we were gonna get caught.  I felt like that, 'cause we, I knew that, that I just didn't see us getting caught and then getting the money back too, that's crazy.  So I started laughing and Alex was upset he said, "Man shut up, man."  I said, "Man this is crazy."  I mean but I was laughing it was fear that caused me to laugh.  But then what, what really happens at a time like that above and beyond everything else is survival kicks in.  And that's a whole another level of thinking that you don't even go to unless you really have to.  And you don't know what that is until you there, I'm telling, you our sur- survival was so key in terms of just surviving this ordeal, the focus was so keen until nothing else mattered.  'Cause we knew we were in really deep trouble.  Once we saw the plane, we heard the dogs, I mean there was a whole lot that we had on our plate, survival was the key.
Story_ID: 364428
Speaker 1: For example, we went to, there was an area there were some lumberjacks and people cutting some trees something like that.  So now we trying to get to this peak of the highway 'cause I had the car parked on the other side of the highway heading in the other direction.  And that was a part of the plan, then we over here doing this, and we then we going really in that direction that way.  All right fine, and it was, this is the way so it couldn't be noticed or if we got back unnoticed, okay.  Obviously none of that's happening, right so that plan is like, but we still trying to get back to the ride.  'Cause when we get back, we got a change of clothes in there we can do whatever.  So I go to this guy and he's cutting down trees and I said is, I said is the highway that way, I say which way is, he said right there, right, you go right through them bushes right over there, and you'll see, and you walk a little ways and you'll find, and you'll see the highway, like that.  Something said don't just go through the bushes, look before you go through the bushes.  And me and Alex [ph.] peaked, and that whole area was surrounded with cops standing with their guns, we would've been dead.  I said yeah, I said Alex said we should go back and get them motherfuckers for lying to us, I said man they, they been informed, they're looking for fugitives, and we're the guys (laughter).  I said I, we ain't got no time to be messing with them (laughter) no so those those kinds, that's the kind of conversation you have, you know survival conversation.  We went into a house and how we finally got, finally caught was went to a house, a shack, it's nothing but a shack.  And knocked on the door and I said this is, I said we been out of here hunting for a while and we're cold you know, its January 22nd, 1970, and this woman says its, its crowded in here, y'all stay outside.  Nobody acts like that down in North Carolina; people are warm and friendly, they had been informed.  And at that same time a little kid runs out the back of the, of the house and he runs down the road.  And Alex raises his gun to shoot him; I said you shoot him I'm shooting you.  He says he gonna go tell the cops where we are, I said I know, I said but he ain't a part of this plan (laughter) and look they don't know nothing about what we're doing you know.  We can't, can't blame them, can't get them involved, that's not right.  And so finally, and with the dogs, that was a freakiest though, that was the freak of the, before that happened, we went into a ditch 'cause we heard the dogs, the dogs are really close, we heard these dogs.  And so when we got into this ditch, I told Alex when the dogs come by man, just don't miss, just don't miss man.  Make sure you're, every shot is, is precise you know 'cause it's, it's like at that moment we just know that this happening, we getting ready to have a real fucking shootout here.  Real major you know kill or be killed and dog, (barks) right on by, and I'm trying to figure out how did that happen?  Because where we happen to fall into a ditch it happen to be a place where people had discarded cars.  And there was gasoline in that area and dogs cannot pick up your scent if it's saturated with gasoline.  They would've done better if they had a torch and just throw a match.  We would've burned the hell up (laughter) it's amazing and so forth.  But so yeah so those were some moments throughout that ordeal, and that was a long day, the cops are mad.  Talking about he went home and changed clothes three times looking for us, I said hey you know, I said, I said, I told the cop I looked there, I said I didn't have the luxury.  I said I'm still wearing the same shit, yeah.
Story_ID: 364429
Speaker 1: So and then the assistant picked us out of the lineup you know, to make sure that we were the people you know that they saw like, and all that stuff, they didn't get the money back.  But they and then they had--
Speaker 2: Did anybody ever get the money?
Speaker 1: Yeah, my boys got it.
Speaker 2: Oh they found it okay.
Speaker 1: They got out of jail, and they said they only found a part of it, but I think that's a lie, but yeah.
Speaker 2: How much did you take?
Speaker 1: It was about eight thousand dollars.
Speaker 2: Enough to get them out of jail, and--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I, I mean I'm estimating 'cause I didn't have a chance to count.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I just snatched up as much as I could snatch up yeah.  And, and that was, that was just funny because I didn't really, that wasn't even a real dramatic thing, as much as the gun.  The gun took precedent over all that because when I produced the gun, everything changed.
Speaker 2: What do you mean when you produce--
Speaker 1: When I, when I said you know what this is, it was like another world.
Speaker 2: To?
Speaker 1: To the, to the Watkins brothers [ph.] to that, that's the name of the guys that we, that we robbed, yeah.
Speaker 2: But they were the KKK [Ku Klux Klan] guys?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay so tell me now when you walk up to them, you produce the gun?
Speaker 1: Yeah I said, I said you know what that is, you know what this is?  And the guy just got ne- I think he peed in his pants, he was so scared, and me and Alex were dressed up like in hunter outfits.  Like a, like we were on a hunting expedition, so we look like two black guys just out hunting, yeah, and we were (laughter).  So but that was, and then Alex is bigger than me he's like about 6'3", 6'4" or something.  So we got these two big black men in our, in our face talking about you know what this is, and I said I know who you y'all are too.  And, and after, and then they were definitely (unclear).
Speaker 2: Of all, of all the lines you can come up with, why do you think that one came out?
Speaker 1: I, I you know, I don't know, but I do know that there was, I did that almost on automatic pilot.  But I do know that I probably could've been, I probably could've been scared out of doing that.  I kind if the, if the guy had said man you better put that gun away something like that, I mean I don't know.  'Cause I really that wasn't, it really wasn't me, but it was me, like I played that par, part for that moment.  But that really, that's not me at all, I'm not really a gun guy, not really that kind of person.  But I did it, I did do that, I put, I was the guy that initiated it, it wasn't Alex, Alex was staying on the side and I was doing it, pulled out the rod.
Story_ID: 362492
Speaker 1: This picture's a picture of my mother [Mattie Robinson Dawson] and me that little chubby guy and my stepdad [Harold Dawson], my mother's husband after the relationship she had with my father [James Smith] who I've never really seen.  But that's a picture of us in the house in Cincinnati [Ohio].  And I believe it was on Oliver Street, and it was a very warm house, and it was kind of customary for families to take little family portraits by the fireplace.  So that's one of those classic family portraits, right by the fireplace.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Awesome.
Speaker 1: I think him and Kain [Gylan Kain] actually located the spot, the place and Felipe [Felipe Luciano] used the place for all, all kinds of workshops.  And, and he just and, and his sister had a store, a clothing store, I think directly across the street from the East Wind [New York, New York], yeah but--
Speaker 2: What happened to the New Breed guy?
Speaker 1: I, I, Jason moved to Atl- Jason moved to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: He still alive though?
Speaker 1: I don't know, I think he is, but I know he moved to Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: This picture is the first picture that actually I think it was taken of me after my return to New York City [New York, New York] from being in school in Raleigh, North Carolina in two ways.  I was in prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina] school and I was at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina], I ended up getting incarcerated for an offense that I'm rather proud of.  Armed robbery, I robbed the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] of some money.  And ended up serving some time, but never really served time, I got time to serve me.  And then I, when at a certain point I got my custody changed from maximum security to medium security.  Which allowed me to go back and forth to Shaw University to finish my education, and then I got on parole.  I got my parole transferred to New York, so this picture was taken shortly maybe about ooh, two months after I got back to New York City after having been incarcerated for three years and nine months.  And I'm contemplating on what the hell am I'm gonna talk about?  'Cause I was really nervous and very, very kind of apprehensive about the moment, even though it's not really showing up on my face.  It's all inside my big head (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  So this is 1973?
Speaker 1: This is 1973, exactly, 1970, probably more like 1974 you know.  A little torn up picture of Clarence Reed, above our heads, but that's Umar Bin Hassan and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Umar's on the right, no Umar's on the right side, that's Umar Bin Hassan on the right, and then that's Jalal [Jalal Mansur Nuriddin], at that time his name was Larry Pudim [Alafia Pudim].  And then there's Nilaja [Nilaja Obabi] our conga player with his hands on the drums and then I'm standing on the left.  And that's, that's the group that recorded the album ['The Last Poets'] that's, that shocked the world with "Niggers Are Scared of Revolution" and "When the Revolution Comes" and "Jones Coming Down" ["Jones Comin' Down"] and "Wake Up Niggers, We All Through" ["Wake Up Niggers"].  That's, and, and it's very interesting because that picture also defines our personalities in many ways as well.  Beca- it's, it's a certain kind of a look that we all present that still stays with us.   Nilaja and as wisdom, even though I'm speaking about it, Nilaja's no longer with us, and his eyes are closed.  And that's exactly the case of his life, his eyes are closed, he's not with us any longer.
Speaker 2: What happened to him?
Speaker 1: He passed, he died he had cancer, he had brain cancer.  He died actually from the same thing that Marley [Bob Marley] died from in the same month and they were born the same year.  It's almost like they were paired to go out like that, and they're about the same size, fiery brother, oh man.  If you had a poem that you thought was gonna be a part of the repertoire of The Last Poets and he didn't pull those conga drums out of the bag, that poem was never gonna be heard.  And if the poem was really, really hot, he may not pull the conga drums out of the duffle bag; he might just get the, the covering off of the, the drum, so he could get his hands on the skin.  So he can communicate with you, and if he did that, it was gone be heaven.  But if he never did that, if those drums just sat there in the case, and he never unbuckled the, the top or nothing, (laughter) that poem is, that, throw that poem in file thirteen.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Oh now that picture there is, I mean that's the, the album cover of 'Time Has Come,' that was advertisement for 'Time Has Come' actually it wasn't the album cover, but it was the advertisement.  Those pictures do, did appear inside the jacket.  That's Babatunde [Babatunde Olatunji] on the left, he's our percussionist now, and that's Umar Bin Hassan in the middle and that's me on the right.  And those, the pictures are done, put together and it was done separately and put together.  But that album happens to be a very hot album.  We had the pleasure of having the services of Pharoah Sanders perform with us on that album; he's on about four tracks.  And we also had the pleasure of having Chuck D perform with us on that album, so that's one of our--all of our albums are hot as far as I'm, concerned.  But that's got some real historical significance because of the people who we had to join us.  But then when I'm thinking about it we have a few albums and that's one of them that has significant historical importance, because of the people who accommodate, who accompanied us.  And that's one of them.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: All right that's a picture of me performing in the East Wind and one of our Last Poet concerts.  And I notice I'm wearing my [maternal] grandfather's [Charles Robinson] watch, something that was taken away from me when I went to prison, and I never got it back.  It was a Longine Wittnauer; self-winder with the calendar on it and everything a seventeen jewel watch, and it was an heirloom.  I had just recognized it looking at this picture.  And that's Kain to the left in the shadow it's like, look like it's a silhouette of Kain, but he's off to my left.  Or actually, it's my, it's to my right in the picture, but as you know--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And who took the picture do you know?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ed Sherman took the picture.  Ed Sherman is, is a very well-known Harlem [New York, New York] photographer and he prob- he might have a number of pictures of The Last Poets.  Because he was very much about cap- you know of documenting the, the carrying-ons of the time, and so Ed Sherman definitely is the, the photographer that, and I remember that.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: How many do you have?
Speaker 2: I've got four sons.  All right this is one of my sons, this is Obidayle [ph.] he's my second son born, and he is my super academician, he's never seen a test that he couldn't pass.  He's brilliant beyond measure academically, but his common sense is really something to question.  But he's got academic skills for days, he's my lawyer, and the one thing that I'll never forget is when he actually graduated from Fordham University [New York, New York].  He refused a, they have it hooked up so that when you walk up the stage after they announce that you got your diploma an, or whatever and walk up the stage.  Then the first thing you're supposed to do is stand right next to the flag and let them take a picture of you next to the flag.  And then you can talk, you can wave to your parents or whatever, but they have it all roped off so the parents don't get crazy and the kids, they can keep everything moving.  Well my son actually, I was so thrilled I was down there by the ropes and when he graduated he did not stop at the flag.  He jumped across the ropes and he gave me a big hug, and, and I will never forget that be, and he said to me, he said, "I'm a lawyer, so I can make life easier for you Pops."

Speaker 1: So we're rolling, today is March--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): 21st.
Speaker 1: Twenty-first [March 21, 2007].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Abiodun [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Completion interview.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 364431
Speaker 1: And we're gonna start with the album--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970].
Speaker 2: Okay.  The album ['The Last Poets'] was recorded in 1969; the album came to be because of the guys in The Last Poets who were considered they were called the East Wind Associates.  We had a place it was called the East Wind [New York, New York], and we had a group of young men who were taking care of the business, I was just a poet.  Gylan Kain had found the loft and so he was kind of like the art director of the loft, and, and Olumide, his American name was Russell Pitchford, he was our manager.  And then we had Bootsy [ph.], a brother named Bootsy, he was the assistant manager, so, so--
Speaker 1: You were talking about the loft--
Speaker 2: We had, we had all these, we had a group of young men who were taking care of business and Kain had said in the very beginning about, when we, The Last Poets first got started, he says, "We're not trying to be recording artists."  He said, "The minute that we go into that category they are gonna have us, 'cause they running that world, and we'll set ourselves up, we'll be had.  We're revolutionaries, we're gonna be organic."  And, and everything he said sound perfect to me.  I didn't have any problems with it, no, 'cause I wasn't trying to be a, a recording artist, I wanted to be a revolutionary, I wanted to bring changes.  That was all I really wanted to do, and if this the vehicle to do that, I'm down and we're gonna take this road.  And I'm listening to all the brothers and sisters that were older than me that knew more than me.  I'm listening, but I'm a, I'm the, I'm the applicator, I'm the one that can make this, this happen man. I'm, I'm a doer.  That was the thing that I think I appreciated about myself the most, I didn't run my mouth only, I would do stuff.  I would take charge and get physically involved, so as time went on, of course it was a short time.  But when you moving that fast, it's like you know every day is a month and, after a few months and Kain and I had, you known worn yourselves out with each other.  Because he really wanted to be my father and I didn't really him to be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How old was Kain?
Speaker 2: Kain was at, at, Kain is like at least six or seven years older than me you know.  So if I'm nineteen, Kain's twenty-five, twenty-six something like that.  You know, it's, it's like I, I had a father [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] that was so powerful, so strong and he, I, I feared him to the point when he died, all my fears died.  So anybody that try to step up to the plate to do that, they were definitely barking up the wrong tree.  It's, that's been done already (laughter) you can't, you can't be my dad so.  He really wanted to be like the cat that, he used to crack on the fact that I drove 'cause he couldn't, he didn't know how to drive.  And I said, "That's right, I'm driving, if you wanna take a, a train to the revolution go ahead, but I'm driving to the revolution.  You know, you wanna walk, you--," so we had arguments, we even threatened each other in the middle of a show.  Like I mean here intermission we gonna fight and Felipe [Felipe Luciano] stopped us one time from fighting.  But the fact is we never recorded together early but we had a hot, hot group, we, it was the strongest group of The Last Poets, as far as I'm concerned when Kain was in it.  Because he's a genius, his poetry is outrageous, he, he said some things that I think will always be the hallmark of what good black poetry is--
Speaker 1: Like what, for example?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: For, give me an example, hallmark black poetry.
Speaker 2: The first nigger poem.  "Walk around Harlem took a vitamin, I heard a voice cry out niggers got rhythm, my head spun around, the people had deserted from that moment in time Harlem became a desert.  From that moment in time Harlem is a desert, Dow Jones went up 1.3, Harlem no change.  Always thought rhythm about time, about pushing about keeping in step, I seen niggers shuffle, ain't never seen him keep no step.  Hey baby what's happening niggers think that's hip, any old breeze is hip to the niggers.  Niggers have rise and cause them different reflections, niggers cry out when their children get bombed.  Niggers roll planes over Vietnam and if you shot down their enemy niggers don't know their enemy.  Niggers get on TV and talk about (makes sounds) niggers don't know cybernetics.  Niggers are obsessed with blindness with the power of death in their hands, niggers killed Malcolm, fucked the CIA, niggers held the guns."  So Kain, and that's just half of the poem, it gets funkier, it gets nastier.  But Kain was that kind of poet, he was, he was a fire and brimstone poet. And his metaphors were hot, right off the street.  And he, and he controlled them, and gave you some fantastic stuff that, I, I had never heard of a nigger being used in a poem.  Let alone a poem dedicated to niggers and to break it down and the title of that poem was very simply titled 'Niggers Untogether People' ['Niggers Are Untogether People'].  And, and or, or you call, yeah 'Untogether People' that was it, I don't think it was 'Niggers,' just 'Untogether People.'  But the, the summation of course is that if you call yourself a nigger, you're not together.  You know, so we and our whole chastisement of the nigger in the black community was our goal.  To get rid of the nigger, to destroy that, that negative character that was stopping us from trusting each other.  So that we can work together and get the job done, so that's the whole impetus of The Last Poets was to destroy that character.  So that we can see the better side of us, the strongest of us, the side that really--but see now some black folks say well if it wasn't for the nigger, we wouldn't of survived.  Well yeah there's a time for the character to exist, there's no question, but the, that can't be the dominant portion of your life.  And that's the thing that we constantly try to reinforce.
Story_ID: 364432
Speaker 1: So what happened with and the group changed.  Because the nigger was taken over as we were moving and trying to become black men, we got all these nigger problems you know.  Lack of trust within our own ranks and, and jealousy and envy and a whole bunch of stuff.  I remember the times if you came in with a poem that sounded like a poem by Kain [Gylan Kain] or a line that he taken--I remember David [David Nelson] was doing a poem and, and a chair flew over my head up on the stage bam.  I said, "Oh shit," and, and Kain said, "Man you fucking thief, stealing my shit."  And they were going through it you know.  We're getting ready to have a plagiaristic war and stuff; I mean oh it was crazy.  There was, and but then the whole concept of The Last Poets was entirely insane.  It is oxymoron; poets just don't flock together, that's an individual thing.  So for us to come together and then try to, and then do a new poem, and analyze the poems and we're working together.  And we're gonna try to work out some repertoire to do this, this was, it was a bit of amazement when I look back on it.  Even now it still is but it's much more manageable with two guys as opposed to three.  And but we were really in the heat of everything, and, and we had a lot of problems because we had to sacrifice our individuality for the collective.  And that's sometimes is a big, big problem, especially when you are just sa- saturated in your own individuality, you know.  You can't see yourself being too much a part of anything.  So when, so finally Felipe [Felipe Luciano], let me see Kain left, he went down to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And this is 1969?
Speaker 1: This is 1968, last part.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968], last part of 1968, last part of '68 [1968].  We go down to; he goes down--
Speaker 2: Kain to the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Kain to the Village, Felipe to Spanish Harlem [East Harlem, New York, New York] to do the Young Lords 'cause and he says to this day I'm the person that told him he should do that.  I probably did, because I'm concerned about everybody's people, and he's Puerto Rican.  And I know that there's a Puerto Rican crew and you need to go get them together, 'cause they ain't together.  So he went and did his thing and started the Young Lords and that was beautiful, and, and I was The Last Poet.  I was left, and I put Umar [Umar Bin Hassan] in the group and, then Jalal [Alafia Pudim; Jalal Mansur Nuriddin] who was working for the Harlem Domestic Peace Corps along with, with me well--
Speaker 2: The Harlem Domestic Peace Corps?
Speaker 1: The Harlem Domestic Peace Corps was a BS poverty agency that didn't do a damn thing 'cause all, to be perfectly honest all I did was every Thursday go get a check.  I didn't do nothing, I supposed to be, but I, but what I, when I on, I look back on it as a Last Poet I'm really doing the work of a Harlem Domestic Peace Corps person.  Because we are trying to get our community together, it's our way; it ain't designed by the state department [U.S. Department of State].  But it's still, and we got paid, so I had enough money to sur- survive you know.  Besides the money we got the gigs, and, and that was cool, and Jalal worked for them too, his name was Alafia Pudim at the time.  And he and he would see me, he knew I was a Last Poet; he wanted to be in The Last Poets.  Kain hated him he called him a nursery rhyming motherfucker.  He said, "Keep that nursery rhyming bitch away from me."  'Cause everything he did was rhyme, and he just felt that was a corny excuse to be a poet, because you can rhyme.  Kain's thing was rhyme is, it's a rhythm that's already established in the poem, you don't have to rhyme to make sure it's there you know.  And, and he, he was very clear about, about having that inner rhythm and rhyme was like a scheme.  He said it was a lockdown, 'cause once you get that rhyme scheme going like that, you can't switch up, you got to stay on that scheme.  And so you lock yourself in, so the freedom of what you really want to say has already been harnessed by the fact that you can't go nowhere you know.  I mean he's just, he, he had a reason for it, and I appreciated it because what he made do was realize sometimes I like rhyme.  But I've ler- learned how to, I just about almost mastered the whole concept of, of presentation with the rhyme and the non-rhyme.  Because there are ways you can say some stuff and, and doesn't rhyme then you go into a rhyme, if you use the right time, it all fits.  Because it's a flavor of what you're saying that makes the difference.  And so, but Kain was a great teacher, and we learned through struggle, we struggled.
Story_ID: 364433
Speaker 1: But the fact is that when I was left, the same cats that were the business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Taking care of the business.  And who were they, what were their names?
Speaker 1: Olumide was one of the cat's names, his American name was Russell Pitchford, then we had Bootsy [ph.] and we got another brother named Snead.  I can't remember all their first names.
Speaker 2: Can, how do you spell Snead?
Speaker 1: S-N-E-A-D.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: S-N-E-A-D.  And he, and, I think his wife was the one that sprayed me with something, one of them, I got sprayed 'cause he was hanging out with us and, I brought him back.  I was supposed been like an excuse, and she came through and sprayed me, I think it was roach spray or something, I.  It was weird though 'cause I was in the hallway said oh God what she (laughter) but she just treated us like insects I guess.  She was so pissed off, oh man.  No, it wasn't Snead, scratch that, it's, his name was Sinclair [ph.], Sinclair, I forget his last name, I think don't if it was Snead or not, but his first name is Sinclair.  It just came to me, it just.  But yeah, that was funny that was funny episode, 'cause I was trying to cover for my man 'cause he was all night you know.
Speaker 2: And how old were you?
Speaker 1: Oh I was like what nineteen years old?
Speaker 2: Nineteen, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's how old I was.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 1: And, and so these guys come to me and they say, "Yo man it's time to do an album you know."
Speaker 2: And who came to you?
Speaker 1: Olumide, the manager and Bootsy all of them, the whole crew, everybody, the whole, six, about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And Claremont [ph.], though everybody. And it's time to do an album because they--
Speaker 1: About six guys.
Speaker 2: Okay, why is it time do an album?
Speaker 1: They said it was time for an album because they felt that, first of all see I didn't know and I'm looking back I'm pretty sure that they were offered some money.  That's usually how these thing happen, but I didn't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And who would offered them money, like what was the structure for people--
Speaker 1: Alan Douglas.
Speaker 2: Alan Douglas, okay go ahead so go so people, it's time to do an album.
Speaker 1: Yeah so, so when they said that, and I said well you know I ran down what Kain [Gylan Kain] said.  And Kain said, "If we ever do that, it's gonna put us in the shit you know, we gonna be jacked up you know.  It's not gonna be happiness."  And so, and so many words that's what I'm telling them and they said, "Man listen; you wanna get the message out.  You can be here in New York [New York] and people in South Africa will be able to hear what you saying, because they'll have it on an album, it'll, it'll spread the word."  And I said, "It makes a lot of sense to me."  He says--
Speaker 2: And he is Alan Douglas that's talking to you?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, oh--
Speaker 1: Olumide.
Speaker 2: Olumide.
Speaker 1: The manager of The Last Poets.
Speaker 2: Okay, right, okay.
Speaker 1: And the other brothers.
Speaker 2: Okay, they're talking--
Speaker 1: Yes, basically the person that did most of the talking--
Speaker 2: Right he sing.
Speaker 1: Was Olumide.
Speaker 2: Olumide, okay.
Speaker 1: He, he was the person, he was my closet friend and all that stuff as well, 'cause I mean we did a lot of things together.
Speaker 2: Now had you, what was his background, where was he from, and you said his real name was Russell?
Speaker 1: Russell Pitchford, yeah.
Speaker 2: Pitchford.
Speaker 1: I know he's from Staten Island [New York].
Speaker 2: Staten Island.
Speaker 1: I don't know what his background was--
Speaker 2: But he was--
Speaker 1: A poet he had a very deep voice, he had commanding presence and he made a good manager for The Poets--
Speaker 2: And how, but how did he come to you as a manager?
Speaker 1: He came to us through Kain.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He knew Kain.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I didn't know him Kain, and Kain decided that we could use his services.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: He convinced Kain that he would make us, make a good manager.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Story_ID: 364434
Speaker 1: So he says it's time to make an album, you agree and then what happens (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, when he said that it was time to make an album, we agreed, but I, I also knew where Kain [Gylan Kain] was coming from.  At least I felt I did, so what I told Olumide [Russell Pitchford] was we'll do an album but we not going downtown to, to audition.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: For jack.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so he told, he told the people that he had, he already probably had these people, I didn't know at the time. But he probably had these people a lot already and that was Alan Douglas and Bob Shaffer [ph.], Bob Shaffer was his partner.  And they came uptown, they came to I.S. 201 [I.S. 201, Arthur A. Schomburg School, New York, New York], it's a school right there on 127th Street, Madison Avenue.  Went up on the second floor and we kicked a couple poems in that album.  Alan Douglas said that's fine, I'm ready, and then we went, to and he, and he then he asked me would be willing to come downtown to 59th Street, 57th Street, I think it's 57th or, yeah I think it was on 57th Street.  The Regent Sound studios [Regent Sounds Studio, New York, New York], same studios that Roberta Flack recorded her album the famous album, 'First Take.'  Same studio with Rahsaan Roland Kirk recorded live on his albums, it's a seasoned studio.  And you go in there, the walls speak of legends having been through you can feel it, and it was a pleasure being there.  And because, and we just, and actually it was funny because we went to record the album, Umar [Umar Bin Hassan] asked me what we're gonna do and I said, "We gonna do what we do," you know.  And I remember I wasn't too feeling, to--we weren't, we having issues with each other.  But we had issues a lot; I mean that's the nature of poets, so we weren't exactly chummy, chummy.  We were just doing this because we were all in the group together, and at the time I think it was coming more and more to the surface that Jalal [Alafia Pudim; Jalal Mansur Nuriddin] thought he was gonna be a celebrity or something.  And he wanted to be, a, a big a, a superstar.  He wasn't thinking revolution, he was thinking in terms of something else, he's thinking ego.  And, and Umar and I were, we were cool and he did his job, and, but there was some, something in the air.  I remember that and, but what we did, we actually did our first set and our second set.  And that's what you hear and on that first album ['The Last Poets'].
Story_ID: 364435
Speaker 1: We did "Run, Nigger," "Nigger Scared of Revolution" ["Niggers Are Scared of Revolution"] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I want you to talk about some of those.  How, whose were they?  Where did--?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well "Run, Nigger" was, opens up the entire album ['The Last Poets'], and it's fiery, and it's dealing once again with chastising niggers.  Trying to get that character into control, because the nigger had run amuck and that's what causing our troubles.  So "Run, Nigger" is a poem, "Run nigger, Run nigger run like you run when the liquor store's closing at Saturday night and Run nigger run like, run, understand the time is running out, running out is hasty as niggers from the man.  Run nigger, run like you run when the liquor store is closing and its Saturday night, run nigger, run like a little roach from DDT.  Run like big niggers on the football field, run nigger, why, while the white man is stealing your culture, run nigger, killing your children, run nigger.  Taking your life, run nigger, run nigger, run.  Run like time never yielding or forgiving always running in a progressive moment.  Never relinquishing running, running, running, running, running, running times done run out."  So that, that opens up the whole album, boom and it's like a bullet, boom.  And then we go to, then we have Umar's [Umar Bin Hassan] poem "Niggers are Scared of Revolution."  I think in between that is "On the Subway," which is a nice little short little poem dealing with our visions of things on the subway.  On the subway I dug the man digging on me, and this is one of Jalal's [Alafia Pudim; Jalal Mansur Nuriddin] rhyming poems.  "I dug the man digging on me / He was hung up in the mass of confusion as who I was / He was trying to see / But me knowing me / Being black proud and determined to be free / Could plainly see my enemy / Yes I know him / I once slaved for him / Made him a pound of black gold / Off the sweat of my labor he stole / But he'll never understand / The new black man / Let alone see us every day / Riding the subway / 8th Avenue, 7th Avenue IND, 6th Avenue, BMT, IRT / He still hasn't dug me / He's on the brink about to sink / I asked you brothers and sisters / Can I save him? / Can he be saved? / No, no / Next stop, 125th Street."  So that time the tomography [sic. topography] of 125th Street was totally different than it is now.  We had 59th Street, all the white folks got off, and then the train was Latin and black from 59th Street all the way to 125th 'cause that's an express stop.  So there was a major, that was a point of, that was the dividing line right there.  So that's why that poem became a classic because everybody knew if you go on 125th Street, you going into the heart of Harlem [New York, New York].  And that's gonna change the atmosphere of the day.
Story_ID: 364436
Speaker 1: So that poem ["On the Subway"] was slick and was the only poem that Frankie Crocker played on the radios.  The only time you ever hear anything about Last Poets [The Last Poets] when the album ['The Last Poets'] first hit, was that, that time.  I remember free, Frankie Crocker, Frankie Crocker was a known deejay in New York City [New York, New York], and he was, he was, actually he used to rhyme, he had, he liked to rhyme, he had some slick poetic things that was, that he would say.  And he loved us, and he would play 'On the Subway' because it had no curse words in it.
Speaker 2: Where did Frankie Crocker, I know the name--
Speaker 1: Yeah Frankie Crocker.
Speaker 2: From my--
Speaker 1: Yeah Frankie Crocker.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Frankie Crocker was one of the best deejays that this city's ever had, he was known for I he, the one thing that he played to open up his show and close his show probably made him probably the most, one of the most clasity, classic and classy deejays in the country.  He used, (singing) "There I go, There I go, There I go, There I go, such a funny feeling I never can explain every time you touch me."  It, it's a song by Eddie Jefferson, it's called 'There I Go' [sic.] this moody, it's called 'Moody's Mood for Love' and he'd opened up with that and he would close with that.  And it was so just perfect, because it gave us a, a touch of jazz and our culture and the words were so slick.  And the, the whole story was nice; it was his, one of his mentals, mantels that we looked forward to hearing.  And then he had a great style you know he was just a very good deejay, he had, he knew how to talk to the people.  He had a nice voice, very smooth voice; he was, whoever the top deejay is now in the, in America he was that for us back then, Frankie Crocker.  You know and--
Speaker 2: Is he still alive?
Speaker 1: I don't think Frankie Crocker--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Is here anymore.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think he's gone, yeah, I'm pretty sure he died.  And he was in a movie too called 'Five on the Black Hand Side' which I remember was a movie done in Harlem [New York, New York].  And he was, he had some little role when he looked like he a pimp kind of guy, but he was slender looking, but good looking brother.  And he was, like before quiet storm he would be the kind of cat that you would imagine would do a quiet storm show.  You know he had that kind of per, persona, but he played us.

Speaker 1: So anyway the album ['The Last Poets'] became, when the album hit, I, actually the album was recorded in 1969 then it came out in 1970.  And when it came out, when it came out I was in prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina].  And that was just unique because--
Speaker 2: So that story you told me about robbing the people.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And getting the money, all of that happened as you, after you cut this album?
Speaker 1: Yep.  I didn't have any knowledge of what was happening with the album.
Speaker 2: None?
Speaker 1: None, I didn't have any faith in anything happening, I never dreamed of getting any money, that wasn't not even in my psyche.  I never thought anybody owned me anything, I didn't get paid, we didn't, we got paid any money for recording it, I don't remember.  And I'm pretty sure we didn't, I mean there was 'cause that wasn't our mindsets, we were not trying to be recording artists.  We didn't know this was a business; we were just simply trying to facilitate a way get people to hear the message.  And we were so concerned about that that was the major concern.  I had fallen out of The Last Poets when they called me some months later, and I was in North Carolina.  They said you gotta come and take pictures, 'cause they gonna put the album out, and so I came.  And if, and the picture that is on that cover, I, it you know when people look at it, you know it's I got it here some place.  But its, it's quite clear that I'm not happy camper, you can see and that, and that album, that's the famous picture, 'cause that's the famous album.  And I, and, and I know, every time I look at that, I remember that day, I could've been anywhere else but with those two guys.  You know, the only person that I probably would've spent some time with is our drummer that's Nilaja [Nilaja Obabi] 'cause he's a been, always a friend.  But Umar [Umar Bin Hassan], I you know didn't really want to deal with him anymore, he wasn't, he wasn't really making me wanna stay.  And Jalal [Alafia Pudim; Jalal Mansur Nuriddin], he was, his ego was going berserk he was, you know he was moving into another world, I could feel it.
Story_ID: 364438
Speaker 1: Now who did you get the money for?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Who did you rob those Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] guys to get the money for, was it those two guys [Umar Bin Hassan and Jalal Mansur Nuriddin] took it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no, no, they didn't have nothing to do with that.
Speaker 1: They had nothing to do with it?
Speaker 2: Naw, they had nothing to do with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I left, when I left New York [New York] man--
Speaker 1: And you went down south--
Speaker 2: After the taking over of the State Office Building [Harlem State Office Building; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Right and you went down--
Speaker 2: I went down south--
Speaker 1: And you cut ties with all these guys.
Speaker 2: All them, there were no ties--
Speaker 1: So these were new people down south you were hanging out with?
Speaker 2: I started the Yoruba's society at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].  I was sending students from Shaw University to South Carolina, Oyotunji [Oyotunji African Village, Sheldon, South Carolina] was the name of an African village in South Carolina.  I'm sending students there to get their names changed, to have marriages, to get initiated into the Yoruba religion.  To study about their, the folks they were before the slave boats came and snatched them up, and I'm, I'm crazy about this.  I'm like, I'm going to campuses, I'm going to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina], I'm going to A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], I'm going to Bennett College [Greensboro, North Carolina].  I'm going to St. Augustine [Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina], and I got my crew and we're upsetting, we're doing impromptu plays on top of this of the table and the lunchroom.  Trying to get folks to stop dealing with drugs and, and all this and stuff and be black and be African.  And recognize your, your strength and stop being a Negro, I mean I would embarrass people, I mean it was crazy.  I was so bold at that, that, I mean I was just so bold, it was nuts.  When I look back, I'm, I'm not ashamed of anything but I mean it was kind of scary 'cause I had no fear.  And I was running off at the mouth all the time, and I would barge into a situation, and I would lambast you.  And I would de- debase you and just defang you, I, I mean I had no, and it was crazy.  And during that time I had a chance to meet some very important people.  I, during that same period, I did have a chance to meet Fannie Lou Hamer, sit and talk with her.  She had come to this school, and she, and that was a blessing.  'Cause talking about Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and all them other people please, the work that Fannie Lou Hamer did will never, I mean nobody can touch.  She was in the down in the Delta Mississippi, and she was working with the poorest of our people, in the poorest conditions possible.  And she wasn't getting any play, no help; she got help from people who understood after a while what was going on.  But for the most part, she did a lot of work by herself.  Amazing black woman, Fannie Lou Hamer, one of the people that we should never, ever forget.  And people talk about Martin and Rosa Parks, please, they couldn't, they couldn't hold her apron.  I mean in terms of really what she did for the people.  But I so, I had a chance to meet her, I had a chance to meet Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth].  He was a professor at--and he was one of the brothers that used to get knocked down, on his, he be on the steps of the courthouse talking to Bull Connor.  And Bull Connor and it's a picture they got in the archives of, of Shuttlesworth.  They got a picture of Bull Connor telling him to get off the steps.  And he's still running his mouth and Bull Connor said bam, and punches him in the mouth, knocks him down the steps.  He gets up, his mouth is bleeding and he's still talking back to Bull Connor says, "That's not gonna stop me.  I'm still coming at you, we still gonna have our rights."  And, and that's, that's amazing.  I got a chance to meet him, we were very good friends, and, and a very special time.  So there, there some people that I met during that period of that were wonderful, but I was bodacious, rambunctious and outrageous when I was in Shaw University.  And I'd gone down to originally gone down to hideout at Enfield [North Carolina] thinking that the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] was trying to get me when they just wanted me out of New York [New York], and when every, and when I realized everything was cool, and I still was hooked up with the United Church of Christ, I went to Shaw University to finish my education.  And to work 'cause I was working and getting paid, so I didn't have to pay for school.  And they gave me a house in Biltmore Hills which is like a real muck, muck section in, in Raleigh, North Carolina.  And I lived at 2024 Waters Drive, had a nice house, actually it was a house that was owned by Cheston Everett.  Cheston Everett was the brother of Ron Karenga [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga], Ron Karenga is the brother who started Kwanzaa (laughter) to show you connections.  And it was really a big, big deal because he called me and says, "Are you treating my fucking furniture right?"  And I mean this guy is crazy, he had this Paul Robeson voice, and I said, "Yeah, we're treating your fucking furniture right."  I mean he's a very crazy guy.  But we had a nice pad, nice place, but the group that I had was strictly an African cultural surge, and African cultural eruption on the campus of Shaw University.  And I would wipe out the Greek fraternities and the Greek sororities.  If they come out with their step shows, I'd come out with my African drummers and we just wipe them out.  And I'd make a speech, "We're not Greeks, we are Africans.  Why you all dealing with them Greek fraternities and sororities and we are African people?  We need to deal with African societies, we need, we got the Yoruba society, we got the Ashanti society, we have a Wa- Watusi Masai."  I said, "There's so many societies we can have, if we recognize and respect who we are."  So I give them lectures, I just off the top boom.
Story_ID: 364439
Speaker 1: I got kicked out of African studies class because I knew more than the teacher.  And he gave me an A he said I, he said I know you know more than I know.  See I had already studied under Dr. Ben [HistoryMaker Yosef Ben-Jochannan] and Dr. Clarke [John Henrik Clarke] before I went down to Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].  So and those, and I had--
Speaker 2: And Dr. Ben and Dr. Clarke?
Speaker 1: Dr. Ben, Dr. Clarke are the greatest historians that have ever been produced in my lifetime.  And they both were very crass, but Dr. Ben was probably a little bit more crass.  He's still living and he's doing very bad in terms of his health.  Dr. Clarke is gone he died and he was blinded before he died, the diabetes blinded him.  But even in his blindness, every time he spoke you could see the smile on his face and he'd still speak to you for hours like it wasn't no problem with him being blind, he didn't have no--and, he, and this happened later in life when he went blind, but it didn't stop him and his knowledge was like a damn water fountain.  I mean he just poured out, and you just had to be captivated, 'cause Ben and Clarke both committed their lives to correcting the lies that we had been told, and getting to the truth.  And then they, and then they both traveled to these places that they just, they were talking about.  To get some real factual information, so they got some information that sure enough is bona fide, no, the white historians for the most part don't wanna really acknowledge them.  But they have no choice because too many other things that come out that that connect with what they're saying.  So Dr. Ben and Dr. Clarke are two of our greatest historians as far as I've known in my lifetime.  There are others Van Sertima [Ivan Van Sertima], he's good.  There a number of other historians, but these cats were the best and, and I had a chance to study under them, before I went to Shaw University.  So now here I am, and I'm a Last Poet [The Last Poets], I come--
Speaker 2: And how did you get a chance to study under them?
Speaker 1: I mean they were here in Harlem [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: In Har- in Harlem, okay.
Speaker 1: Harlem--
Speaker 2: Community.
Speaker 1: Yeah in the community man, every chance that they spoke I was there you know.  Even when they ate at Sylvia's [Sylvia's Restaurant, New York, New York] I try to sit and eat at the table right next to them.  And we became friends, because I was a poet, and they would all, and then Dr. Clarke and would even suggest certain things that needed to be in your poetry to educate the people.  But of course if we put everything in there, then it wouldn't be a poem, it'd be a lecture you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But it was still the idea was beautiful and I got a lot and I did imply a lot.  And I employed what many of, but both of them said in many ways.  But down at Shaw University you know this, I'm in like first grade, 'cause these people don't know much and I'd come from New York [New York] and I'm a high powered brother.  So I'm running my mouth, I ain't cause you gotta understand, I'm nouveau aware, I just woke up black the other day.  And when you discover your blackness for the first time, and you love it, you get crazy and I was crazy.  I went nuts, I mean I wouldn't take off my sandals and when it's getting cold, I'm still around wearing sandals.  My, my feet adjusted to the weather, you know I became almost like Mooda Maruki [ph.] you go down to Jamaica he don't wear no shoes, no time.  I, he was up here we did a gig at New York college, and Mood Maruki's one of the great dub poets, and he don't wear, man we're at New York college and it's wintertime, he's going around with no shoes on.  And the security guard said man that guy's got no shoes on, I said, I says that's Mooda Maruki he don't wear no shoes.  So I was really trying to embrace every cultural nuisance I could imagine, and of course, the American shoes, I'm not.  And I wore my dashikis all the time, someone challenged me about the dashikis.  I said, "We gonna make winter dashikis, put on a fashion show of winter dashikis."  But at--during all this time, there were people of course always challenging.  And these two brothers who challenging they said, "What you gonna do when the man tries to vamp on you, you know?  How you gone protect yourself and your culture, your women and all these African ideals, you got guns?"  So that's how this whole thing got set off.  And the, and I said, "Any punk can get a gun."  So we designed a plan to get guns.  Rob Thorns [ph.] and Dixie's [ph.] the two gun shops in Raleigh [North Carolina], this all happened in 1970.
Story_ID: 364440
Speaker 1: Go ahead tell me that's one reason why and then you'll pick up from when the album ['The Last Poets'] came out (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  One reason why I, I did what did in terms of building the Yoruba society [at Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina] was to, to provide an example of what I wanted to see.  And as opposed to talking about niggers all the time, you know.  It, it became a case of me trying to create black people you know, and I felt strong enough, which is really arrogant on my part.  But I felt strong enough that I could take a nigger or take somebody who was a Negro or colored or shallow in terms of their understanding of themselves.  And give them a diet and a menu that will make them African, strong and proud, I really felt that I could do that.  And, and I guess in a, in a superficial way I probably did, and then in a real way some of them went on and did what really happens is they changed themselves.  'Cause there's a brother named Ralph Thurmond [ph.], he's a professor down at Clark [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and he's very well-known in North Carolina, I mean in Atlanta, Georgia.  And he, he took me for verbatim everything I was doing with the polygamy and everything.  And this brother studied the religion and went to Nigeria and got in those showboats, they with the high priest and, and learn and studied and worked.  And he's making money and he's got five wives and he's doing it the correct way, 'cause each one of his wives has her own house.  Each house has no less than ten rooms; I mean that's the only way you suppose to really have polygamy.  If you can afford to put each woman in their own space, and they all are professionals, and, and also polygamy is not like you the romantic sugar, sugar daddy of the neighborhood.  No, it's a business situation, marriages in Africa were business, it's like we can work together.  And in the meantime, we can also make love and have some kids, but the reality is that we can work together.  The way you pick yams and the way that I, I grow corn or whatever, and, and man we got that down.  And that's magical and we can be prosperous together, so the relationships were based on business, as opposed to romance.  Romance might've been a catalyst to get the attention of somebody, but that wasn't the basis of the relationship.  No relationship can survive on romance alone, that's like eating candy all the time eventually your teeth will fall out.  You know you'll get sick, romance is a, is a dessert, it ain't the main meal (laughter) and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 364441
Speaker 1: So in 1970--well when the album ['The Last Poets'] came out you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, so when the album, so what happened is after the robbery and all that and, and on the day that we got time it was you know special moment.  Because I am, I, I, a, a verse, a song came into my head that I think really still sticks with me today.  When Judge James A. Sprubilly [ph.] gave us the time, me and Alex [ph.], he says stand up and say I give you no less than twelve no more than twenty years in the state penitentiary of North Carolina.  The first thing that popped into my head was, "Goodness and mercy shall follow all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever," [Psalm 23:6].  I'm not a religion, I don't quote, I don't, pray and sh- and all that stuff, but that, that, I know that verse 'cause I was raised in the church.  And that verse, that part of that verse 'cause the whole 23rd Psalm, of that, just that part made me feel so perfect.  I felt like it's gonna be okay, I never fe- I didn't have a moment of doubt.  And that just popped, "Goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever."  It's you can't touch me, I'm good to go, I really, and so that's the attitude that I carried.  I always had this reputation from jail that there were certain things that I, I mean I was real, I had been running my mouth when I was in jail 'cause jail the first time.  And I figured maybe I can create an army of brothers or something, that was foolish, but, but when I got to prison when the time was given at the trial and everything, I realized my best shot would be to get myself together obviously I ain't that smart if I did what I did and I let these people catch me.  So I, I took personal homage to that, I really felt like you know somewhere down the line you fooled yourself.  You're not really that smart Abiodun [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole], 'cause you let these dumbass people down here put you in their clutches.  You took their money all right, big deal, got your boys out of jail, big deal, but look at you.  You in here, and they giving you, they just gave you twelve to twenty years.  Now if you mess one time, you looking at twelve, you mess two times, you looking at twenty, now what does that look like for the rest of your life?  So I had to talk to myself, I had to get; I had to get, I had to really kind of get with me.  And then I said you gonna be in here and you gonna shut up, you ain't saying jack, you gone do the things you supposed to do and get yourself together.  And get out here, you gonna to work out something where you gonna serve time beautifully, and it ain't gonna be long.  And this is what I told myself, and then I said, I, I'm thinking of what can I do with this time?  'Cause that's the biggest thing, and it's amazing, it's like a game, somebody just gave you time.  And they said, all right kill yourself, when you can live yourself (laughter) you can develop yourself can do some fantastic things.  So it becomes a case for me where I learned how not to serve time, I got time to serve me.
Story_ID: 364442
Speaker 1: And in getting time to serve me, first thing I said, I'm a write a book, so I wrote a book called 'Jesse' [ph.].  And as I was writing the book, a brother named Jonathan Byrd [ph.] who had been there for on a third time on a ten-year charge for manslaughter.  A man had put his hands on his wife's ass, and beat the man to death; he didn't mean to beat him to death.  But he definitely meant to hurt him, but the people, he had hit, the man hit his head on something and he, and killed him.  But the people, the white, good white people of Mecklenburg County [North Carolina] who saw it, they did testify on Jonathan Byrd's behalf.  But black man can't beat no white man to death, and not go to prison that's crazy.  So they still gave him ten years even though it was like a crime of passion.  And he, the man was solely out of order by what he did.  But he would wat- Jonathan watched me re- writing everyday he'd see me writing, so he built up enough courage to come and talk to me.  Asked me about what I was doing, so I told him I was writing a book.  And I said you know while, I said and he said, "Well you know I been here, this is my third time man."  He said, "I used to teach in the Mecklenburg school (unclear), I'm a, I'm wanna write a book.  (Unclear) is exciting and I became, I become a master hustler since they wouldn't let me teach anymore.  I know all the games and I wanna do a book." I said, "Why don't you starting writing it?  Make up the stuff." I said, "What you do, I'm going write my book during the day, and you write yours during the day."  You know 'cause we both worked in the prison hospital, and so there's time in between your duties to, to write.  I said, "In the evening, I read to you what I wrote, and you read to me what you wrote."  So that was our TV.  And man you can't get nobody to do nothing like that out here, it's too many distractions.  That, that was perfect, perfect, 'cause you writing you like a scientist, you writing, you creating this story, and now you getting follow-up and feedback because you're reading it to this other brother.  And he's reading his story to you.  Oh man, we had so much fun, and then, and he would always say at different times when we were talking and whatnot.  He would say things like, "New York, New York, the Big Apple," well they call me New York because they knew I was from out of state.  My number indicated that I was from out of state 'cause when you have OS on your number that means out of state.  So then when everybody found out the state that I was from was New York, that was you know like a nickname, you know.  So, and so he would say that from time to time, he was sought New York, New York, and a few, first few times he said, it I didn't say anything.  But I, maybe it was about, it might've been the fifteenth time, 'cause I was really trying not to expose myself (laughter) he said that, and I said, "Byrd that's my shit man."  He said, "What you mean that's your shit?" I said, I said that what you're saying, that's my shit.  He said, "That's my shit man, I love that shit, man that's the cat, that's the group called The Last Poets man," I said, "I know man.  I'm trying to tell you that, I, I'm one of them."  He said, "New York, you been in here with me (laughter) for about two months, I don't know what you talking about.  These brothers are from New York man, they just came out, this is hot.  This is like what's happening now."  I said, "I'm trying to tell you that's--" I said, "I tell you what you do, you tell your wife, you, your wife's coming to visit you Sunday.  You write her today, tell her to bring the album cover [of 'The Last Poets'] with her on Sunday, and then you come back and you tell me."  And he came back, "What you doing in here man?"  He had tears in his eyes, it was blowing his mind.  He said, "Man, what you do?  Oh."  I said, I said, "Listen you know that, and I know it, we're not trying to broadcast.  I'm not getting no brownie points by being a Last Poet in Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, I said let's keep this a nice quiet secret.  This is between you and I, I don't need nobody to know that I'm the brother that's got the baddest revolutionary piece of literature out that's not even being endorsed by the large industries.  But people are buying it, it's causing a stir."
Story_ID: 364443
Speaker 1: Now I knew what was happening with the album ['The Last Poets'] because of my wife [Biji Davis (ph.)], she would write me letters, I would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now when did you get married?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: When did you get married?
Speaker 1: Oh I got married, when did I get married?  I got married just be, in '68 [1968] just right after, let's see.  Four weeks after, yeah it was in must've been November of '68 [1968].  I may, let's see November, yeah, it must've been November of '68 [1968] because Pharoah [Pharoah Davis], my son was something like four weeks old.  And it was the funniest thing 'cause we got married and then she went upstairs and brought Pharoah downstairs (laughter) instant family.  But I got married because this, she was a girlfriend and I was seeing and she got pregnant and I, and at that time anther one of the most revolutionary things you could do is have a child.  And so and have a family that was also considered to be at the top of the charts of revolution, you know we could have a black family, and we got children.  And we're teaching them the right way, we can change things over a period of time.  So when I fir- when I saw, well she first of all, we had had a very unsuccessful relationship.  She I mean, I, she was not giving me any (laughter) and then I forced myself on her and, and she looked like I was killing her and so what I did is, I stopped before I did anything.  I said that's it, I'm cutting her out of my life.  Anyway she ended up conceiving and then I said well I hope you and the guy--well she called me and told me she was pregnant, I said  I hope you and the guy, after five months after I hadn't been with her at all.  And I said I hope you and guy have a wonderful life together, you know, she says what do you mean, you're the guy.  I said, I said, "Now (laughter) I ain't going for that," I said.  "We didn't have a relationship and I ain't seen you in five months, and you crazy."  So I, I cursed her out and I threatened her and I even went over to the house with my gun, in case she has one, eight brothers and I thought maybe they would, might get a little crazy.  And I was ready for whatever, I was not gonna take the rap for having this woman with my child.  So, and then I went, I looked in the bassinet and I saw his face that looked like mine, and his head looked mine.  And this spirit spoke to me right away and I was with another friend of mine named Amir [ph.], and he said, "That's your son man."  And so, she said, I said, "What's his, what you, what name did you give him?"  She said, "Timothy."  I said, "Timothy?"  I said, "Naw," I said, "his name Pharoah.  I said, "I want his name changed to Pharoah," I said, "and we're getting married," I said.  She says, "I don't love you."  I said, "I don't love you either."  I said, "We'll work on that," I said, "but this our child, and we gotta think about that."  And that was a focus then more so than anything, the unity of man and woman and family, all of that was part of the revolution.  And so I got married in the house on Sullivan Road, out in St. Albans, Queens [New York] and it was on camera and that's I even seen pictures that was really in, interesting.  They did the whole nine, and then she went upstairs after the ceremony and brought Pharoah downstairs and we played with the baby.

Speaker 1: I mean it was really, but she was a good, good sister and I actually I did the caper that I did to get the money from the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] was done on her [Oyewole's wife, Biji Davis (ph.)] birthday.  And I told her, and the day that I did it was January 22, 1970, and I told her that, she told me she says I don't think today's a good day to do that.  I said who's doing this, and I cursed at her I said just mind your fucking business, I'm taking care of this.  But she was absolutely right, I mean first because of the fact it's my wife birthday, don't make no sense for me to be doing this stupidness.  So it was all crazy, but she would write me letters, I mean that was the only communication I had between her and my mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis].  And my, the majority of mail came from her and she would write me letters on a regular, I mean I get three letters a week or whatever.  And it kind of respect that I received in the prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina] was just uncanny because Perry [ph.] was our prison; he was the guard of our, of our cell.  So, while the dormitory really, it was like a dorm situation, and for some reason man he, he book, put my mail under my pillow.  So if I had mail, all I had to do was look under my pillow and my mail would be there.  If I didn't have any mail, I didn't never have to stand; I never had to stand in a crowd when they called mail call.  'Cause the, the routine was a certain time of day you know, he would pull out the mail, and he put his glasses down, they be hanging on his nose.  And he'd say "Johnson, Wilson, Smith" you know, "Harrison, Harris," you know he'd mention the names.  And if your name wasn't called, you was set-up.  'Cause that meant somebody's watching, nobody loves you, it's like three days, four days, you ain't got no mail.  Wow, hey man I got some candy, or you smoke, I give you a cigarette you know.  Next thing you know you're in debt, and the only thing you got to give up is your ass or your mouth, but they wanna collect.  I didn't have to go through none of that, all I had to do is go to my cell, go to my bunk, look under my pillow, and have my mail.  Next time somebody see me I'm reading my letters, and they know I didn't stand out there.  And so they wanna say but everybody know I'm not brownnosing nobody, 'cause I don't, I ain't talking to nobody.  First of all I knew if I open my mouth, that was a problem, because I don't sound like I'm from North Carolina.  So that's a problem, then I have a deep voice, so that's another problem.  And we got an album ['The Last Poets'] out, and somebody might be able to pick that shit up and that's another problem, so.  I, I, I'm just trying to be cool, and I realize that the work that I did, I hadn't, I had personal work to do in prison.  And I realized that at the right time, I'm glad they got this thing called jail before you go to prison (laughter) 'cause in jail I was wide open and I was crazy.  If I went into prison like that, I'd done, you never, we never have this interview, you would've never seen me.
Story_ID: 364445
Speaker 1: 'Cause I was nuts in jail [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina], I cursed a preacher out so bad in jail, they put me in solitary confinement.  Yeah every Saturday the preacher would, in jail, when I was in jail, the preacher would come on Saturdays with two little white girls.  In those little Catholic school uniforms and they have, they'd be singing come to the church in the wildwood, oh come to the church in the vale ['The Church in the Wildwood'].  And then he start preaching and talking about you too can be forgiven.  God will forgive as sinners and you too, and ain't nobody in here been found guilty yet.  We are in jail ain't been no trial, and you've already condemned everybody in jail, and you talking all this madness about what God is gonna do.  And you got these two little girls supposed to be like your little angels singing these sick songs.  And we can't get away 'cause we locked in this cell, I went nuts, I said God didn't pick you.  How can God pick you to be his messenger look at you with your cheap skin, your cheap face, you ain't got no face, a complete face.  And you gonna, think God would pick you to be a representative of him and these girls can't even sing, can't hold a song, can't hold a note.  God has people that can sing, they can't sing, can't play, you can't preach, I said God didn't pick you for nothing.  I blew them away, and he stopped preaching, and it got quiet.  And the next day, the only black jailer, Mr. Rogers [ph.] came and said, he said, "Davis [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole] get your stuff," and I thought I was going to Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].  I thought somebody bailed me out (laughter) and he took me downstairs to the basement and down to the sub-basement.  Took me and put me in the hole, place they have a little hole in the floor, a place for you to do all your business.  And that's where I stayed for like, I only stayed there for about three, four days.  And they had put me solitary confinement cell with a prison, with a white cat who had just killed his wife, who was stepping out on him.  And he'd follow her, follow, followed her and finally he couldn't take no more and he shot her to death.  And everybody in the community loved him, his name was George Burns, I can never forget it because we had a famous actor named George Burns.  And this guy came in with blood splattered all over his white shirt and the police where there when they brought him in.  And then the head jailer, Mr. Harris [ph.] told me he says I want you to take care of George for me 'cause I, I, think you, you can do that.  And I'm trying to figure out now everybody know I just cursed the preacher out, I went off, but again my angels intervening.  I don't know what happened, but it, taking care of George Burns; first of all I almost killed him because he cried so much.  And I told him I said you cry one more time, you'll never cry again, I said I'll stop you from, from ever making a sound, cry one more time.  'Cause now I'm in the cell with this guy, (imitates crying) I mean over and over again.  And then the, the police are bringing him food from the baddest soul restaurant in Raleigh [North Carolina] 'cause that's all he eats, and he ain't eating nothing.  Because he's distraught 'cause he's killed his wife and he can't get over it, he still got this on his sh- he's got the same bloody shirt on.  The cops, but he never went to trial, he went from jail, home, and he never ate none of that food.  I ate it all up, the mac and cheese, the yams, the greens, the cornbread, the chicken, I ate it, I ate good.  And he stopped and he, and he would just (makes sounds) I said you better, I said you, you killed her, I said you shot her.  I said I don't know why didn't shoot the dude too, you, if you just wanna shooting thing, I mean you just blew your wife's brains out.  Now you all messed up, and you gone cry, no you not gone drive me crazy with that, you gone stop crying right fucking now.  I said cry again, cry one more time, make another fucking sound (imitates crying) I said go ahead and die.  I said you go and die right now, I don't care, I said just go out and die.  Man it's, it was wild but he never went to trial, he stayed there for two days, he calmed down, thanked me profusely for saving his life, and I was gonna take his life, he talking about saving his life.
Story_ID: 364446
Speaker 1: And then they left me in the cell [at Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina], I stayed there for about another week and then I found, but what we, but what that did it put me right close to the head jailer's office.  And I got a chance to talk to Mr. Harris [ph.] 'cause I'm doing him a solid with trying to help this character [George Burns] who they have big respect for in the Raleigh [North Carolina] community.  And I said well you know my birthday is coming up, and it was, it wasn't even a lie.  And I said and I would like to at least let my family know I'm okay, I got kids, you got kids?  I said yeah, how many kids you got, I said I got four, I had one kid, I had Pharoah [Pharoah Davis].  I said I got four kids, but I wanted to pad it up 'cause I wanted to use the phone.  'Cause I needed to get out on bail because I mean ain't nobody coming to get me out on bail.  This is crazy, you know I should been out by now, I mean this is like on the thirtieth day, I mean I'm woo, it was scary.  So I got, I mean I he said well during visiting time, I'll let you go in the office, but now keep your door closed.  ' Cause I don't want everybody see you, and so man but I'm looking 'cause I'm looking at the women and everything else.  But I'm on the phone man, I'm talking to California, I'm talking to Alabama, I'm talking to everywhere I got friends.  I got to get this money together; they got me on a hundred thousand dollar bail.  I gotta get out and I need money I need ten thousand dollars like yesterday.  I had one of my wives had five thousand, but the other wife wasn't getting in touch with her 'cause she was at odds with her.  So I then so I got on the phone and called up my first wife Pharoah's mother, my, the very first wife.  Called her up and I, and, and I said, and she wasn't home, her mother told me she was in the city, I knew she, where she was.  I called that number and the sister answered; Gaye [ph.] was the sister that answered the phone.  And I say is Biji [Biji Davis (ph.)] there, she says, yeah she's on her period; I said I don't give a damn if she be the death.  I said get her on the phone, she says, well you how do you, do you escaped, did you escape?  I said no I didn't escape damn it, so Biji gets on the phone and I said what are you doing?  Well how, how's the bail money coming, I mean am I getting out of here or what, well I don't, I said know you call Nelay [ph.] 'cause she's got five thousand dollars.  And I want you to get together with her, and y'all bring yourselves down here with the ten thousand and get me out of jail.  I'm not, how you can talk to me on the phone, are you out, you, you, you, you.  I said, I, did I, if I'm telling you come down here, obviously I'm not out, no, I'm in jail.  Now I'm talking loud like I'm talking now, and Harris come, man we can hear you outside, he said man calm down (laughter) I was so pissed man 'cause I'm still stuck in this place.  Alex [ph.] had gotten out after five days 'cause he's the cousin of Clarence Lightner, who became the mayor of Raleigh.  So he had all these connections, they got him out right away, we ended up getting the same time, when we got, went to trial.  But as far as jail, he ain't spent no jail time, I had jail time, I had jail time walking up to right, I'm in a major anthology called 'Getting Busted' ['Getting Busted: Personal Experiences of Arrest, Trial and Prison,' ed. Ross Firestone] (laughter) with Rap Brown [H. Rap Brown; Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] and all the other brothers that spent time.  And this after I had spent thirty-eight days in jail, I spent thirty-eight days in jail, and became a prized damn prisoner.  Because Harris liked talking to me, he thought I had something smart to say, and I used the phone every day, every day, every day.  I had a better phone privilege than the brothers in Rikers [Rikers Island, New York, New York] and all them places, if they had cell phone for them brothers, I had a better phone privilege.   I got on his phone and called everywhere I wanted to call anytime, I mean not anytime at during the visiting time.  'Cause the, that was the only time he could justify me being out of the cell.  So that was, that was the unique situation.
Story_ID: 364447
Speaker 1: So the album ['The Last Poets'] came out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The album came out--
Speaker 1: The only way you got news about it is from your wife--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt, Elvenia Robinson Davis]?
Speaker 2: And then I got a letter from, from a lawyer, Larry Phillips [ph.] was his name.  That said I'm as, I'm writing this letter to for you to give permission for your wife to receive your royalty check.  And of, of eleven thousand dollars, and so I'm saying wow, royalty check, then I got angry at the guy asking me to give him permission for wife to get it.  'Cause I'm figuring that's automatic you know, obviously I can't get it you know.  So then, but he said, "Well you'd be surprised how many cases you know like this, the wife will get the money, and then she ain't married no more, you know, she's off and running."  And I said, "Biji [Biji Davis (ph.)] would never do that to me."  Anyway to make a long story short without going through all the details, she did do it to me (laughter) in a sense.  The money became, 'cause she was already, she was getting welfare automatically because she had already said that her husband's in prison.  So that's automatic, they give you welfare right, oh your husband, fine, you put, so she was getting a check.  And she was staying with her mother, so she didn't really need no money, 'cause moms is, got a nice house it's over on, the same house we got married in.  So she was cool, but and then the royalty check came, and I'm thinking eleven thousand, in 1972 that's a not a piece, that's, that's a nice piece of change.  You know we can look forward to doing something with that.  So when I came up for review for custody change, the three people, well John Baker who actually played for the Pittsburgh Steelers, he is on the board of paroles down there.  He's a sheriff now, but he used to be on the board of paroles of Raleigh, North Carolina.  And it was one black guy and that was John Baker he was a big lineman, big bruising brother.  I remember one day he came through the gym when I was playing, he says what you in here for?  And I got sassy with him, I said you, I heard that you on the board of paroles you know what everybody's in here for.  He said I didn't ask you that, so why don't you answer my question?  I said I'm in here for armed robbery you know, he says yeah I know your case.  And then he didn't ask me no more, but he had a, for some reason I think he liked me.  I came up to the parole board and I remember the white woman she said to me well--
Speaker 1: This is after two and a half years?
Speaker 2: This is after about a year and a half.
Speaker 1: A year and a half okay.
Speaker 2: About a year and a half.
Speaker 1: And the white woman says to you?
Speaker 2: And, and so I'm up for possibly custody change, 'cause I haven't done anything, I've been cool and they have a period where you, where they bring you up for review.  Most people don't get any real custody change right away but at least you get chance to talk to the board of parole and all that kind of stuff.  So and they ask you stupid questions you know like well why do you wanna get out (laughter) you know.  And what I think is a stupid question, but I know if I said 'cause I wanna get out you know.  They would say he ain't getting out, so I said because I wanna reunite with my family and finish my education, you know you gotta have things that you say you want to do to b- and so then I answered all the questions, I knew and I knew the games, so I was answering questions as clean without any BS.  And then the lady asked me she says, "Well Mr. Davis [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole], I wanna tell you I see you got down here that you wanna finish your education at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].  Well from what I know Shaw University ain't giving no scholarships to any of inmates here at Central Prison [Raleigh, North Carolina].  And we don't have a scholarship system, and according to what you have in the back hall, it ain't that much to be paying for tuition."  I said, "Well I have some money other than what's in the back hall.  I realize that I don't have a scholarship fund for me here or at Shaw, but I think."  "Well if you can't pay for your tuition you know you gonna end up back here.  We'll have to put you back in maximum security.  Because you're applying for student release and not a work release," so I said, "I understand," said, "Okay, you can go."
Story_ID: 364448
Speaker 1: And then I, I didn't know what was happening.  Four months passed before I got called and I got called, I was accepted into the program and they put me in the honor grade unit.  Honor grade is the med- is, is medium security, min- or minimal security and I remember a brother named Mr. Lilly [ph.] came and got me out.  He was my counselor, that I was to, was to report to.  And when we got out of the gate right in front of the sixty foot wall, I said is it permissible for me to scream?  He said be my guest, and he didn't know how big my voice was, and I screamed, he said oh my God, oh man that's all the people this and they come and get us.  I said you said I can scream, he said man, but he says, the cats just looked.  Everybody was like this, like looking, but I, I mean I let it out, sh- I let it out, ooh.  I mean I, I it was like something that was inside of me, I guess I'd been holding on for all them years.  I mean after all the months and I let that bad boy out, then I got into honor grade.  And then I went to school the first day, I went to register; oh no I called my wife, from school.  And I said, "I'm at Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], I'm getting ready to register for class, send me five thousand dollars."  "I ain't got five thousand dollars." I said, "Biji [Biji Davis (ph.)] it was only couple months ago you had eleven thousand, what happened?"  "I had to live." I said, I mean I remember I dropped the phone I was so upset.  So I said, "Okay," I said, "what can you send me?"  "I can send you two thousand." I said, "Send me two thousand please."  That was enough money for me to register for one semester, I registered and I started thinking, now how am I gonna be, how what am I gonna do for the next semester?  I, I designed my own class; my earliest class was at seven in the morning, so that meant that I was up, out of that prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina] at five in the morning.  I wouldn't take the prison bus to go to school, I would walk from the prison to school, and that was about two miles.  So that was the best two miles I ever walked in my life, and then I would be back.  My, I had a late class at like seven o'clock in the evening, I be back in prison by nine o'clock.  So all day I was gone, I designed the perfect schedule, and the, and the truth is I only attended two classes.  And one was communications and the other was biology.
Story_ID: 364449
Speaker 1: I'm in the mix.
Speaker 2: You, two classes, you had the two, biology--
Speaker 1: Yeah biology--
Speaker 2: Communications.
Speaker 1: Yeah biology and communications, the only classes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So what did you do the rest of the day?
Speaker 1: Oh I stayed at the radio station doing my shows, I, I designed two radio shows while I was at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].  They were called, I called them 'Variations Phase One' [ph.] and 'Variations Phase Two' [ph.].  You couldn't get certain books in prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina].  They would take certain books away from you if you had them, and they had their own library.  They wanted you to read the same great theatre books the silly stuff 'Bronco Bob' [ph.] and all that kind of crap.  And so what I did, I designed two radio shows, and hour long each where the first fifteen minutes segments of the show, I would read segments of parts of 'Native Son' [Richard Wright], and I would do the characters.  I had music underneath, so it's like you're listening to the book you know live on the radio.  So I had fifteen minutes segments of 'Native Son,' the first, my first show of 'Variations Phase One.'  Now 'Variations Phase Two' I had fifteen minutes segments of 'The Spook Who Sat by The Door' [Sam Greenlee] so I'd read that.  And my promo that I used was so if you haven't read a good book lately, you can say and when somebody ask you have you read a good book lately, you can said yeah, even though I'm reading it to you.  Something like that you know, and, and these are two of the baddest, these are two well-known black books around.  And 'Native Son' is really just a investigation into our pathos though which is something that America does over time.  And but 'The Spook' is of course a rebellious book, it's a, it shows brother, 'The Spook Who Sat by The Door' is about this brother who is in the FBI [sic. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)].  And he took all the training and all the secrets and things that he got from being the Xerox copy guy.  After he graduated at the top of the class, they made him just a copier guy, they didn't give him no assignments.  He took all the information he got and he gave it to some gangs in Chicago [Illinois], the Cobras and the Blackstone Rangers.  And they ended up taking over the City of Chicago, because they had more against the cops, and he enough, he had enough information, enough expertise and knowledge to know how to train these boys to be disciplined enough to take over the city.  It's a real spoof of course it never happened, but it's like something that could, so it's never really been brought up.  The movie was done by an independent project, not I don't think Hollywood did it, but there was a movie.  And I remember the brother named something, Cook, Lawrence Cook played, he played Dan Freeman.  Who was the, the FBI operative who trained the gangs on all the tactics that he had gained.  Anyway that was a pleasure and I played a lot of music, I did poetry, I, I always had music, and I, I would do my poetry sometimes.  But most of the time, a lot of times I would do other people's poetry or Langston Hughes' poetry.  But I, I, I did a lot of poetry by [HistoryMaker] Bernie Casey, a lot of people don't know he's a poet, he's a very good poet.  The actor Bernie Casey, and he's also a, he was a great athlete as well, he's a very fine poet.  Doesn't write long poems, but they're very good and impacting poems.  And then was a young lady at the school, one of the sisters one day actually called up to the radio station and said, and she asked for me.  And she says, "You think you the baddest poet in North Carolina huh?"  I said, "What, what's that about?"  She says, "You know I mean I hear you, I listen to you show, but you ain't the baddest poet.  My roommate is a better poet than you."  I said, "Really?"  I said, "Well how come I don't know who your roommate is? I mean, nobody seems to know your roommate."  She say, I said, "Why, I, I haven't even seen your roommate's poetry you know."  So she said, "I'll bring you some of her poetry," she brings me two big loose-leaf notebooks this thick of poetry that's typed up.  And in the plastic covering with pictures cut out from Jet and Ebony magazine to go along with the poems.  I mean this is the neatest book of poetry I ever seen, I mean it was like this person painstakingly put these things together neatly and evenly and colorfully and just.  But it was her own, and it was all loose-leaf and this big, and I saw and it was, it was a multitude of stuff.  And I started looking and it was good stuff, I mean some of it was just cute stuff like, like I remember the first thing I read.  I remember it was when I think of you I think of you as my cup of coffee, black, strong and hot.  No cream or sugar needed, good to the last drop.  You know and, and the politics done in the, in this humorous way in which she presented her poetry was so perfect.  I mean she, I Doris Kemp is her name, her poetry is outstanding she's a genius.
Story_ID: 364450
Speaker 1: So I used to read her work a lot she was like a, a second coming of Gwendolyn Brooks.  And even when I did my play, I did a play that responds to a play called 'For Colored Girls' ['For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange], and it was ca- the name of my play was 'Comments' [Abiodun Oyewole].  And I knew I was gonna get a lot of flak from a lot of the sisters 'cause here's a brother respond to this all female play.  So I used Doris' [Doris Kemp] work in parts where I know that they thought that it was me, but this is a sister who's got sound mind and body and spirit.   And she is clear about the devout, the growth of her people, she knows what we need, and we can't separate ourselves, we need each other.  So I would do poems that spoke about black men, black women working together as opposed working apart.  And the, the women wanna say that's contrive you can't tell a sister what to say.  And at then at the first play, when I did the first showing of the play which was a standing room only crowd, and its crazy caused me to do the play three hundred times.  The, the girl would said you try'na, 'cause I have a section in my play called Comments on 'Comments' after the play.  People could ask me questions and stuff like on stage.  And this woman you trying to tell sisters what they ought a say, that's contrive, you can't speak for us, we speak for ourselves.  I said oh, I said oh by the way, I forget, I failed to mention, I said all of the poems that were done by the sisters and the first poem that was done to open the play called the liberation poem.  I said Doris you here somewhere, I said Doris can you please stand up, and everybody said ooh, and girlfriend got her stuff and left.  I had nothing to say, what could she say you just lambasted me, you just came down, this a black man telling black women what to say.  No this is a black woman saying what black women say, I'm just promoting it.  So that was a lot of fun, so I did her poetry a lot at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina], that's where I first met her.
Story_ID: 364451
Speaker 1: And I didn't meet her, I met her poetry, then I met her months later, she is very shy, very, very shy.  Don't want nothing to do with, like these poetry slams, she would never participate in nothing that they got in the city called the open mic and book.  And killed everybody who would ever appear, but she wouldn't never do that.  Her poetry was a personal comfort to her soul, had nothing to do with, so I exposed her, I ran her poetry on the air.  I played music, her girlfriend liked me, she thought I was cool because I, and I and so forth--
Speaker 2: And so what?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: And so what?
Speaker 1: No, no, she just--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: She just liked me you know thought that at because I gave her, 'cause she really thought her girlfriend, her roommate's [Doris Kemp] poetry was great, she was right.  And, and she had the wrong attitude about me, she just thought that I thought that I was all of that, and I didn't I was that.  I mean I had the big mouth and the big voice and, and the command of the presence and stuff, but I've always been a humble person.  People will look at the outside shell sometimes and they say oh man he's, he's all wrapped up, he's caught up in himself.  He ain't got no time for me, he can't hear me, and they don't know I'm the biggest sponge on the planet.  I listen to everybody, and so, so that, that but that show is great, so I, the show was programmed from nine to ten and from ten to eleven.  So I was back in prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina] at nine o'clock to hear my show, so here we go all this cellblock with the headphones on.  I say, "Yo Brother New York I'm listening to you man."  "Yeah man, thanks for the love you know."  'Cause I said something to the brothers you know back in the place you know I'd say something just leave a message to y'all.  'Cause I knew that that's the only way they can really know what's happening was through the radio, and the only you can listen to the radio is if you had headphones you know.  And I had the greatest headphones, 'cause mine was made out of a set of a stethoscope (laughter).  'Cause when I went to the prison hospital one of the brothers who had been in prison for ten years named Lorenzo Walton, great guy, great, great, great guy.  He showed me how to make my headphones out of the stethoscope.  They ain't got no headphones in the store that can be those headphones stethoscope, first of all just a fact it is what it is you know, what it's used for.  And then to use that just to listen to your music oh, come on that's a heartfelt affair (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 364452
Speaker 1: What happens after you finished at Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Oh after, Shaw, well--
Speaker 1: Because you finished the program and you finished school.
Speaker 2: What happened is, is I went, I successfully completed study release, I had a couple of episodes that could've put me in Caledonia [Caledonia State Prison Farm; Caledonia Correctional Institution, Tillery, North Carolina].  Matter of fact my partner got sent back to maximum security 'cause he had a roach in his back pocket and they busted him.  So he got busted back down, and he went back to max, but I finished out, and finished the school with my--I got you know did the, all my credits, I didn't march or go to the ceremony.  But I remember the day, then I got paroled and the day that I got paroled it was a big faculty meeting, I'll never forget.  And I was so excited 'cause I didn't have to, that meant I didn't have to go back, and I already established a life outside of prison.  So it was just a matter going through the technicalities of getting the parole, so I could just live this life.  'Cause my life now had come to a point where I had a lady, I would leave prison early in the morning and instead of walking to school I walked to my house at 708 Florence Street.  Florence Street was where I had a house with a lady, and she had a daughter who became my substitute for me not having my son [Pharoah Davis]. So Sowandee [ph.] became my daughter, she's not my biological but she became my daughter because it was her mother's child.  Same age as my son basically, and everywhere I went Sowandee would go, if I went outside to look at the stars at ten o'clock at night, here comes Sowandee, two years old.  Her mother said where you going, and I'd say leave her alone she's my girl you know we, she hung out with me everywhere.  If you saw me, you saw her, I could not get her out of, and it was so perfect because I was longing for my son.  So here I got this daughter to take the place as she was Kool and the Gang, I mean she was so perfect.  And, and so I would go home, eat, make love, do whatever, change clothes to go to school, then drive to school.  'Cause I had a car, but my lady had got the car, I paid for it but she, she got the car, and well we both paid for it, 'cause she was working.  And so when I got parole I, I went straight of course to my house and then I went, I got the car and I went to, I went to school.  There was this big faculty meeting and I busted in and I said, "I'm out, I'm out, I'm free."  And I just, "Oh excuse me, I'm sorry y'all."  And everybody started clapping, they said yay.
Speaker 1: Because the people at school knew?
Speaker 2: Oh everybody knew me--
Speaker 1: Oh you, it was no secret?
Speaker 2: No sec--
Speaker 1: And did they know who you were then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: By this time they knew you were The Last Poet?
Speaker 2: They knew who I was man, it was a known fact, I mean it was and, but the thing that was more impressive wasn't even The Last Poets.  It's what I had already done at Shaw University, I was a legend at, for the at Shaw University--
Speaker 1: For creating the--
Speaker 2: For creating the Yoruba society, and then for taking money from the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK], and for going to prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina], I mean this gave me points beyond 50 Cent points.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah that's right, because you were going back home in a sense when you went to Shaw University.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you know I mean and well not really 'cause home is Cincinnati [Ohio].
Speaker 1: I know what I mean in the sense that you created a life.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You started the society there--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I was.
Speaker 1: Like people knew that you--
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: Yeah you were a legend.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You went off to--
Speaker 2: They had already--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They had already talked about me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: During the years that I--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Was in prison, like man we got one of The Last Poets here and he did and he did that, and of course the thing that they said I did was way beyond-what I did.
Speaker 1: What had happened, yeah.
Speaker 2: You know they just blew everything up, I mean I had recreated the pyramid, I built the sphinx you know I mean the way hear them talk.  You know this guy just created civilization all over again you know, but I mean I was rough rod.  And I was like all the things I said, I was rambunctious, I was outrageous, I was crazy, I was a nut, and, and I really, and, and I was really abrasive in many ways.
Story_ID: 364453
Speaker 1: And I remember I said some things that, that haunted me for a minute, and in one incident it, it came back to be okay.  And it was Georgiana [ph.] a gorgeous girl, tall, beautiful girl, beautiful body, everything.  One day she was going to one of our meetings.  And she had on this halter top and tight pants, and I said where you going and she said I'm going to the women's council.  I said dressed like that, she says I dress like I wanna dress, 'cause there was a code; you know you had to wear African clothes, and blah, blah, blah.  And I said you know what, you're the mirror of all my mistakes.  And man shit broke her down, she went running upstairs and crying, and, and I didn't see Georgiana for weeks.  And I just thought I had tore her to shreds, but my mouth was like that, I'm walking around with switchblades in my mouth.  And I'm cutting you up without any reservations, and when I got out of prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina] the very first day.  When I'm in the bursar's office getting ready to register for the, for class and stuff [at Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], who runs with a beautiful dress on.  Looking like a gorgeous woman, Georgiana, and she says, "Dun [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole]," and she hugs me, she says, "oh I wanna thank you for helping me become a woman," whew.  And I was harsh to her, I told her yes, and you are the mirror of all of my mistakes.  And she took that and she did whatever she, however, it, it happened to work for her (laughter) but I wouldn't recommend that method.
Story_ID: 364454
Speaker 1: What--they made other albums, did they make those albums (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah they made--
Speaker 1: --without you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'This is Madness' came after, 'This is Madness' came while I was in prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina], 'Chastisement' came while I was in prison.
Speaker 1: And did you go back to the group for the 'Hustlers Convention'?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, and that was something that I didn't have any desire to do, I didn't care if they were the top group on the planet.  I didn't have any desire to be with those cats, 'cause I knew them and once you have learned people, and you been with them a minute.  If they left not a good taste in your mouth, why would you wanna go back?  So I had no desire to reunite with The Last Poets, the only thing that I discovered was that I money due to me.  And so I wanted to make sure that whatever that, however that took place--but what even was more exciting was I had, another, I created (laughter) I created another group when I came out of prison, the African Revolutionary Ensemble.  And we, of course the, the number was ARE you know so we ARE you know then that ARE stands for African Revolutionary Ensemble.  So this was a twenty-five piece group, I had band, I had musicians, I had singers, I had dancers, I had actors, and we go around the schools.  And put on all kind of shows, impromptu shows we did, we, I took what I had done with the Yoruba society [at Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina] on another level, and I made it like an entertainment troupe, and it wasn't, I didn't put the requirements, the heavy duty requirements of the, of the whole African thing.  But they it was still African motif, you know we wore African clothing and everything, but we wasn't the same.  I didn't deal with it like a society, I dealt with it like a, a group, an ensemble.  And every Sunday we got together and ate and Nile [ph.], my, my lady at the time, she was, she's a marvelous cook.  So we ate well, people eat so well then the next thing you see everybody's knocked out, sleeping you know.  But we had a lot of fun, and, and we hung out and did a lot of wonderful shows together to the point where we were, I, we got a lot of recognition a lot of new writing.  And it was so funny because we would do shows in the timeslot that I had available (laughter) 'cause I had to be back in prison at nine o'clock.
Story_ID: 364455
Speaker 1: So I remember one time--I remember the greatest moment that I remember with the group or, of dealing on that level with these shows was [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis had just gotten out.  On, she had just been released from prison or and on parole whatever they, they gave her, but she was out.  And Ben Chavis [HistoryMaker Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr.] was out on appeal, Ben Chavis was, was he had become the head of the, was it NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or something or I think at yeah at one point.  But he, he was out, he was on appeal from the case that he had against him the Wilmington Eleven [sic. Wilmington Ten] they said he was a part of the conspiracy to overthrow the government, whatever.  So he was out and there was, so some people had gotten together and decided that these two folks should be given their props and we should have a big thing at Raleigh Memorial Auditorium [Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts, Raleigh, North Carolina] which was the big auditorium where all kinds of big events took place.  You know you got Ben Chavis and Angela Davis, two of the radicals of the time, let's do a show.  And let's see who we can get to open up, we get, yeah Abiodun [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole] and, and that group the African Revolution Ensemble [sic. African Revolutionary Ensemble] to open up.  So I told them, I went over to Raleigh Memorial Auditorium and I told the guy in charge of the stage, of the stage I mean, the stage manager, I said is everything gone start on time?  He says it's gotta start on time promptly eight o'clock, if we don't it's gonna be messed up.  Because it's gonna cost more money if it goes over eleven o'clock.  I says it's gotta start on time, right on time, 'cause at nine o'clock I gotta, I'm turning into a pumpkin.  I ain't tell him what the deal was, but I wanted them to know that man, and it 'cause I wanted to do the show.  So everything, at eight o'clock people were there and start on time.  And Angela Davis and I were backstage, and I go to Angela Davis and I say, "I think we probably came from the same plantation," and she says, "What do you mean by that?"  I said, "Your name is Davis, my name is Davis, we didn't come on the boat with those names."  I said, she says, "Well I don't know brother," I said, and I mean, I'm look at this as very light humor you know like just not trying really to get in your pants or nothing.  But just trying to just strike up a conversation, she was colder than ice left in the refrigerator for years.  She was freezing, and the fr- and the frost from what she said was so apparent and I, and I, I just realized that this, she's got, she's got issues, she's got problems.  And it blew my mind, because all I knew of Angela was the poster and she was the finest revolutionary sister ever made.  And she had the baddest fro and she just looked great, if you didn't have a poster of Angela Davis in your house, you really weren't revolutionary.  If you didn't have the picture of, of Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] with the spear in one hand and the gun in the other sitting in the, in the wicker chair, African wicker chair, you weren't revolutionary. There were certain images that just made this movement so delightful, and hers was one, and Huey's was another.  And then of course some others, but those were the major flicks, and she was a cold, cold bitch, cold, but I didn't let that stop me.  'Cause, I, we opened up, I remember this song that I had written for the opening, "They don't care, no they don't care about the people dying everywhere."  And, and that, there's more to it, but that was the first line I remember, and I had my crew come in, they had harma- harmonic parts.  And we rocked, it was beautiful thing, and I'm looking at the time, looking at the time, looking at the time.  So at about fifteen minutes to nine, I'm gone, poof, and I got people to take care of these and the other stuff to be, asked to do, I got folks that will do it.  But I had to get back to prison on time, cause if I'm late, that's it, they ain't giving you no second chance, not like that.  But that was a memorable moment because I did get a chance to meet Angela; I already met did, Ben Chavis 'cause he was over at Central Prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina] with me.  And the first time I saw him, I was on the east side for some reason and I saw him sitting in his cell and he looked like he was dying.  And I said and this is a revolutionary brother, I said you the man?  He said, hey, hey brother, I said naw, man I said I just peeped you man, I said come on.  I said you acting like you waiting for somebody to bust your ass, that's what I told him.  He probably would never tell anybody that now, but I, I saw, I saw the punk in him, right away.  He was scared to death being in prison, prison did not, and I went in there and I had all these brothers who gave me man of respect.  I ain't never been in prison, that's not my world, but I got mad respect, but I know it's because of the way I was raised.  I was raised by a mad man [Oyewole's maternal uncle, Joseph Davis] who gave me a lot of strength, a lot of internal stuff that made me walk a certain way.  People didn't just walk up and try to punk me or chump me, and I, and you couldn't make me feel like I'm in a bad situation.  You can't put me in any situation and make me feel like this is really bad, even though I know it's really bad.  I'm the master of how bad it is you know, and so that part I carried with me.  And you know you think when you hear about these leaders like Ben Chavis and Eldridge Cleaver and so forth.  That they got that same stuff, it's not true, it's not true, they're victims.
Speaker 2: So what other Panthers did you know, who else in that movement did you know, the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party]?
Speaker 1: Well I, the people the Panthers I really knew well were here in the city Quincy Balague [ph.] who was one of my best friends (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 364456
Speaker 1: --How did you get back to New York [New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah that's what I was leading to.  We had this group [African Revolutionary Ensemble]; we were running around performing, we had a wonderful thing going.  Larry Phillips [ph.] became a friend of mine, the guy that gave me my first royalty check that wrote me the letter for permission.  He became a very good friend in terms of just looking out you know, he, 'cause he really had, had enough of dealing with Jalal [Jalal Mansur Nuriddin] and Umar [Umar Bin Hassan].  'Cause they were a little crazy, and he kind of realized in talking with me and, and then corresponding with me that I made a little more sense.  And, and so it all came together, so we became kind of good friends.  So he said to me, I told him, I said, I cal- I told him I said, "You know I'm not even worried about The Last Poets, I' glad you on their case," I said, "I got a group here that's off the hook man.  I'm taking The Last Poets another level boom," I said, "forget about that."  He said, "You really start another group?"  I said, "Yeah I got a bad group."  He said, "Why don't you send me something and, and we'll listen to it?  See maybe we can work out a recording date."  I said, "Okay fine," so I sent them a little tape of one of our rehearsals, he called me back the next day.  He says, "Listen," he says, "can y'all get up here, can you get out for a weekend pass or something and get up here and record that stuff?"  That's outrageous, and so I said sure, so I made a deal with, with (laughter) with Archie Hargraves [J. Archie Hargraves] who was the president of Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] at the time.  I didn't have no credit card, I didn't have no car or nothing like that, I needed a car to drive up to the city.  And I had a weekend pass, but I had to be back to be in prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina] by that Saturday, I mean by Sunday night, no Sunday night, yeah Sunday night.  I had to be back for Sunday night, so I had a weekend pass from Friday to Sunday evening.  I had to be back at nine o'clock, ten o'clock in the evening, no nine o'clock, same time as my regular time.  So I schemed to drive to all the way up to the city, eight hours with my group and record on that, that Saturday.  And then get back in the car and come, and stay Saturday and then Sunday drive back, that's exactly what we did.  We recorded thirteen pieces and we, I had thirteen people and my mother [Oyewole's maternal aunt Elvenia Robinson Davis] fed some people, I stayed at my house and some, and some people lived in New York so they went home.  And buy then a lot of folks were living in different places so they went to somebody's brother's house, my flute player's house in Brooklyn [New York].  But we, it was fantastic, we recorded without any glitches, cause what we had been doing every day is rehearsing.  And I had, 'cause I got out of prison so early, I se- I created a rubric, by putting a sign said if you can sing, dance, act whatever, meet me in the ballroom at seven o'clock.  You know 'cause I wasn't taking no classes you know I mean, I just was out, so I had all these musicians, all these throwaways people that didn't want to be in the choir.  People didn't want to be in the band, but they had talent, and they would come to the ballroom, and I was creating stuff, and I had already written stuff in prison.  So I had this whole thing going on, we were rocking it and rolling, had some, had this bass player named Ya-Ya [ph.].  Who actually worked on Henry Kissinger.  I don't know if was his heart or his brain or something that was messed up, but he, he no, it must've been his brain he's a neurosurgeon.  And, and he, and, and his name is, his name is Dr. James Dorsey [ph.] now, but his name was Ya-Ya then.  He used to come all the way from Durham [North Carolina] with a tub and the stick with the homemade bass, I mean that's how serious my group was.  And when came up here to New York to record, he see, he looked at the studio, it was the same studio where we had recorded 'The Last Poets' album the same studio.  And when you, we, he and I said Ya-Ya, I said that, I said, "You see that big fiddle over there?"  I said, "That's yours man."  He said, "What do you mean?" I said, "For this recording, you don't have to use your tub man, that's it."  He started crying man, the tears, he says, "You kidding?"  I said, I said, "I, now I seen you play the tub, I don't know if you can play that thing."  He says, "Oh man," he says, "I can." I says, "That's you baby," he was so happy, so then, then the guy Bob Lifton he was the cat that was engineering.  He said, he said, "So how you wanna do this; you want me to put y'all in booths?"  I said, "Naw," I said, "we gonna do this the way we roll, the way we, we rehearse this, this is a live performance."  I said, "All I want you to do is turn the mics on and get every sound that comes out of our mouth."  And here I am playing [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones, I'm directing shit while, while we're singing.  I got all kind of background stuff going on and I'm giving them oohs and ahhs  and I'm and, and when I finished I turned and I looked in the control room and the guy said, "Damn Dun [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole] this shit's fucking amazing.  Damn y'all were down there creating magic," I mean we didn't go over, we just went straight through.  Bam the first take, bam, and rocked, and then my man, my piano player he saw the vibes he said man I want to put some vibes on there.  I said you know how to play that he says naw I ain't never played it before, but it's got musical notes.  And I know music, everybody I had in the group was a genius, I mean it was no question.  They could play anything, and do anything.  The brother who played my, who played piano names is Jim Akins [ph.]; he's a bridge architect, that's what he does for a living.  James Dorsey, who was Ya-Ya, he's a fucking neurosurgeon, that's what he does for a living.  Matter of fact he ain't even doing that no more, the government has co-opted him, he's in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] working for the American Medical Association.  Just sitting as a consultant he's not even doing what he really needs to do.  They using his brain right now, and I told him I said that's a fake gig.  They paying you more money but we need you to be working doing your craft 'cause you got genius skills.  You got an ability that's outrageous, they just shut you down, and say oh you too smart to do this mundane shit.  But everybody in the group was special and, and we recorded and every--
Story_ID: 364457
Speaker 1: And Larry [Larry Phillips (ph.)] went on and hooked us up in a Beaufort [North Carolina] hotel, gave us a suite.  Now here we live in this city [Raleigh, North Carolina], I live in the city; we got people in the city, we all straight.  But he says naw, y'all gotta be treated like stars, this is, y'all did some star time stuff this is fabulous, we're gonna treat you.  And they brought the food and drinks and we partied and so forth and so on, and then we had this gig with Stevie Wonder, this was all in 1973.  We adorned the baddest robes man, we enlist Stevie Wonder's people here to hear what we had recorded, they loved it.   And they had sold twenty thousand tickets at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] and, and we were, we had adorned the baddest African gear we could think of.  And we were ready to go on stage and rock, and we knew Stevie Wonder was gonna take us and take us everywhere he went from then on.  We knew it was gonna be a rap 'cause he heard this stuff and he loved it and he said he couldn't wait to meet us.  And he got into a car accident in Salisbury, North Carolina; he was in a coma for five days.  And when he came out of it, he wrote the famous album called 'Innervisions.'  And that's stopped everything, and at that point you can imagine the sky fell at Raleigh, North Carolina.  And I had to, I said let me get my ass back to New York [New York].  And by this time I had gotten paroled, but I was still trying to stay in North Carolina 'cause I had made it good, I turned bad into good.  I got a bad group [African Revolutionary Ensemble], I'm a big fish in a little pond, its okay, but the pond dried up with Stevie Wonder.  And we had to go to the radio station and make a tape so that when he came to we could, at least, he could hear you know whatever you know how many tapes were made come on.  Trillions, if somebody I mean Stevie can't see so you know a lot of people made tapes.  And the only thing that came out of that was when I went to the radio station, I met who became my wife of my, I mean the mother of my son who's a lawyer, I met my third wife or whatever Aisha [ph.] I met her there.  She's the one that gave us the bad news that the concert was cancelled because Stevie Wonder was in a car accident.  We said what, blew us away, but at that moment I became instantly depressed (laughter) I think everybody else did.  And I started making plans to get back to New York.
Speaker 2: And you came back to New York in what year?
Speaker 1: I came back to New York in 1973.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Late '73 [1973].
Story_ID: 364574
Speaker 1: And I see this sister, she writing, and I so I went over to her one time and she was cute.  I said, so I went over to her and I said, so I said if you--
Speaker 2: Hold on for a second.  Okay go.
Speaker 1: I say what are you writing, she says I'm writing a letter and I looked and I said, I said Sullivan prison [Sullivan Correctional Facility, Fallsburg, New York].  I said, "You one of them sisters in love with brothers is prison?"  "Well they need love too."  I said, "I'm a brother in prison."  She said, "Sure," I said, "I am," I said, "every morning when I come here, I'm coming from prison."  And she did not believe me, when she found out, Johnny Spang [ph.], there was no more letters to him (laughter).  And she was my girl for a while until she did the fatal thing one day and said (crying), "I can't believe you going to prison, you going back."  I said, "What, well hold up, I'm dealing with this, you ain't dealing with this, you can't, I can't wow," and that's, wow I can't use that, woo, man she's scaring me.  'Cause I had already come to grips to the fact that this is my day, this is how things are going, I have to, come in school [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], then I go to the prison [Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina], and I come out and this is the routine.  I mean and we gotta go through this for a little while.
Story_ID: 364575
Speaker 1: But, one thing I did want before you go on to, well we'll go on to the Black Panther Party.
Speaker 2: Right, well, well I mean the Panthers, I only really became associated with the Panthers from the involvement with whatever we did here in, in Harlem [New York, New York].  And I had no, I mean I knew of Mark Clark and Fred Hampton and their efforts.  I knew they had a very successful breakfast program and education program in Chicago [Illinois].  I admired it tremendously; of course I had admiration for the intelligence of Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton].  I had never had any real love for Eldridge Cleaver.  I always felt that he was fake, and then when I found out that he was with Bunchy Carter when he told Bunchy Carter to take off his clothes and let's go outside.  And know that they won't kills us because they'll see that we're not armed you know and Bunchy said man that's like some old faggot shit, I ain't doing that.  And Bunchy didn't do that, he, he shot it out with the cops and he got blown away.  And he's dead and Eldridge Cleaver took off his clothes, he went out there they arrested him naked like an idiot, and of course we know the rest and then he did some other stupid stuff, but like you know, I, I respected certain aspects of what the Panthers were about.  I thought Huey Newton was brilliant and Bobby Seale, I thought he had some basic sense.  And I, and I'm not as close to him as some of the other members of The Last Poets, Umar [Umar Bin Hassan] he's closer to Bobby Seale.  Actually Umar went out to California and stayed in Oakland [California] for a while and hung out with the Panthers, I didn't do that, I never did that.  The Panthers that I hung out with were here in the city [New York, New York] and if I hung out with, they were more like them hanging out with me.  'Cause I didn't, I never really prescribed to these uniform organizations, I never liked that, I never liked that.  I never could be a Muslim because they wore them damn bow ties, and I could not stand bow ties, and I could not stand that uniformity of dress.  I didn't particularly care for the Panthers' dress code of all black, I thought that was drag, I thought that was dreary.  I didn't think it was bright.  But at the same time the seriousness I endorsed and they definitely were people who looked out.  We didn't hardly ever do a show without having the Panthers stand on each, one on each side of the stage.  Just like this, as, as like our security guards.  You know they looking for whoever is gonna hurt us, so what, so we got maximum protection from the Panthers of whatever city we were in.  Whatever city, if there was a Panther organization, they came out like the troops, boom The Last Poets are here.  And they are our word warriors and we gotta protect them.  We go to Compton state man and you see the brothers get up on stage like soldier form, I, I almost wanna crack up because I'm not, I don't require that.  That's not one of the things or you know some people you have some brothers that like that stuff, they think it's cool.  It makes them look like they're you know Thutmose or Ramses II or something, but doesn't do nothing for me.  I, I you know but you know, we, we it, it that's how, that's what was happening, and, and you had to go along with the program.  That was part of the program you know.
Story_ID: 364576
Speaker 1: How did you get to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: How did I get here?  When I decided to leave North Carolina and come back home of course I needed employment (laughter) so I started thinking about you know places that I could get work.  This was not one of the places I was thinking about, it just so happened a good friend of mine named Mcyedia [ph.] I know if she ever hears this tape, she's gonna love me to death 'cause I remember his name and she's a sweetheart, she called me up.  She knew I had just gotten back, and she called me, she says you ain't got no job huh?  I said I ain't got no job, I just got back.  She says you wanna teach, I said well sure, I mean I like to teach, she says I gotta job for you.  I want you to come down to Columbia University.  They had a program here called Community Education Exchange Program, CEEP was the, the name that we called it, the acronym CEEP.  And, and the program what you had a people from all over the world trying to get their degrees in English or get their GED [General Educational Development] or something.  But they're trying to get acclimated to the American society at, through the education area.  So we had were accommodating some of these immigrants by, and, and basically we were black and Latin, who were coming in.  And had a GED program and we had a, we had a program, like say, you had, you were a lawyer in, in Argentina or doctor or whatever and you needed to get your certification in English.  We had a program to get you that, so and it was supposedly only work with about seventy-five chosen folks.  Well of course the people who tried our program because of the need, we had four hundred people involved.  Columbia starting getting scared with all these black kids who are not matriculating were using the gym, the library and all this stuff.  So we just got Columbia locked up, and you can see, I mean to see this clump of black kids and they are not Columbia kids.  And it was making the power structure, the power people over there kind of uneasy.  So they decided to kill the program, they said this is it, these, people got carried with it they done gon overboard.  They took, we said you can have seventy-five; they multiplied it four times more than that, five times.  So, so when they, when that, when that happened, we had a demonstration, everybody looking at me 'cause they know I'm radical.  So what we, we got a protest this, we gotta protest this, so I said well you know what, I sa- I, I said we, we can protest it, but the real deal is I can't be directly in the front lines 'cause I'm on parole (laughter) and I'm a go, they gonna put me in the joint.  I said but I can design stuff, so I designed the takeover of the, of the president's office.  Because we were gone take over the graduation that would have gave us a lot of play but according to one of the brothers who was a security guard.  He said brother I'd have to put you all in jail, it's gonna get ugly, he says, he says because it's too many white people here you know of note.  And this would be a real mess if y'all took over the graduation, 'cause its outside.  But I was you know, I, I wanted to make a big impact 'cause of what they were doing to the community I felt needed that kind of thing.  But I compromised you know 'cause the brother and it just happened that the brother became a very good friend of mine.  He lived in this building, the only black person that lived in this building.  And then we became very good friends.  So all these, he's old enough to be my father and I took that into consideration too, 'cause he wasn't coming like a cop.  He was really coming with sincerity like I ha- I'm telling you man it's gonna be ugly, if, 'cause we been instructed not to, I mean to be lenient and not and the folks are just waiting to bust some heads you know.  So I said okay we can do something else, so I designed a take-over of McGill, Bill McGill [William J. McGill] was the president at the time.  And we took over his office, I remember his secretary, I didn't, I was outside, but I remember the secretary wouldn't, I'm staying with my boss (laughter) and so she was kidnapped too, so she put in the, she was held hostage.  So we locked them up in the, in their office and this is the first time that I ever seen anything like the electric wedge.  Bill McGill was standing in the window, he saw me, we had already had meetings and discussions.  And I was like a person that he knew that he to deal with mentally 'cause I was quicker than him.  Or just as quick, 'cause he'd say something slick out of his mouth and I'd say.  So we went back and forth, back and forth, so when he saw me, he, he says (smiles) like he grinning, like so now what?  You know that kind of attitude, but he was acting like there's no fear here you know, I don't care what you little kids are doing.  And then as the cops came with the blue riot helmets and stuff, and they had a thing the electric wedge, I never seen it in my life, but it's a thing that you put at the seam of a door.  And whatever is behind that door, it's gonna open, it's gonna push it aside.  So they had the file cabinets, they themselves were behind the door, I mean trying to make sure that, and that wedge (makes noise) and opened up everything.  And they put, they put the handcuffs on the folks, ushered them the downstairs, and put them in jail.  They were only, and we knew they were only gon be in jail for a few hours 'cause its civil disobedience.  Ain't no really cr- no real crime being committed.  And we already had couple of Jewish lawyers on call (laughter) to get them out right away, we don't want them mamas missing them not tonight none of and everybody be okay.  And I was down, I was there, I was on the scene but of course I hadn't done anything, so I couldn't get nothing on my record or nothing like that.  But all that gave me extra notoriety.

Speaker 1: And then I, then John O. Killens [John Oliver Killens] was teaching a, had a creative writing class here at Columbia University [New York, New York].  He was leaving it, so I took that over, so that also put me in, so that kept me here at Columbia.  And then I, I kept teaching, I was teaching not in the CEEP Program [Community Education Exchange Program] I was doing the creative writing workshop on Saturdays.  That's the involvement I had with Columbia and I started teaching at City College [City College of New York, New York, New York], and of course they were paying a little more money than I was getting paid working in here.  And, but now I'd gotten this apartment because I was working at Columbia, I got that job, the initial job working at Columbia.  Then I had realized that housing was something I could, I could utilize and so that's how I got this place, and that was perfect.  And then what happened after awhile I got a Dear John letter from Columbia, after I'd been here like maybe ten years.  They sent me a letter saying how long will it take for you to vacate the premises?  And I just, you know my heart hit the floor two times (laughter) 'cause when you get a nice apartment in New York City [New York, New York] the last thing you wanna hear about is you gotta give it up.  And I know that Columbia has this thing about if you gonna be in our property, you gotta be affiliated with us, you know.  And I was not affiliated any longer, they had killed the program.  I had my little workshops, that was gone now, I wasn't even do, so I'm and I, I'm just living here, I'm not dealing with Columbia, all right.  And then I ended up where I had discovered that there was a thing called a fellowship, a Revson, Charles H. Revson Fellowship.  Charles H. Revson is the guy that provides Revlon products.  And he's taking all that cosmetic money and he turned some of it over to an institution like, well a lot of it to this institution here.  So he's provided a fellowship, so he's given Columbia millions of dollars for these fellowships for worthy people.  Who have done things in the community of New York City and are, or seeking more education in their, in their area.  So this is money for you to just not go to work, not do nothing but just go to school, do what you wanna do.  Get your extra degree, whatever.  And a bunch of people apply every year 'cause it's a, it's a beautiful fellowship (laughter) and only ten people can get picked.  So when I applied for the fellowship I went over to the housing, they sent me a letter and I knew I couldn't escape any of their requests.  Because they, they got the keys (laughter) they can kick me out you know boom.  So I go to the housing people and I said listen I applied for a fellowship, I, the note, the notice of who made it will be determined by the 2nd of February.  By the 7th, if I will give you a two week notice and I will be gone, 'cause when I first went over there, I told them I said I need at least a year's notice.  I mean I need at least a year to find a place, they said no, nobody gets a year to find, no way we'd never accept that.  So then I said okay so then so that's when I got the fellowship thing and I came back and said, "Okay in two weeks, after the, who gets the fellowship."  So the lady said, "Well that--." I said, "Is that, is that--." I said, "Will y'all go along with that?"  She says, "Sure, it's fine," she says, "but I don't, I don't want you to get your hopes up because that's a very tough fellowship to get in.  A lot of people are you know in."  I said, "Two weeks, okay?"

Speaker 1: And I don't know what I did, I don't know what pots I pulled out, I don't know what ancestors I called on, but I know one thing.  I wasn't gonna be defeated if I had an opportunity to get to the, to the top twenty-five 'cause there are like maybe five hundred people that applied whatever.  And then it gets down to the twenty-five, and out of those twenty-five, only ten are going to be picked.  So when I was a member of the twenty-five to be interviewed to get a physical interview with the people who make the determination.  And so I went there over to one of the halls at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] to be interviewed, and I ended up where one of my friends, a brother named Rudy [ph.] he was gonna be interviewed before me.  And it was good to see him, but it was weird to see him, because he had a suit and tie on, he didn't dress like that.  And I'm saying oh he's really trying to impress these people you know, and I was casual like I am now.  I was just real casual; I didn't dress up or nothing.  And so when Rudy went in there looking all proud and clean, and he came out like his head down, he looked like somebody had beaten him to the, to the earth.  I said oh man, I said naw that ain't happening to me, I said forget that, I don't know what this is a Spanish inquisition or what.  I said but I am not coming out like that, that's crazy, so I put that in my mind.  I walked in there to the room, and it looks just as intimidating as you can imagine, all these professors sitting around a big goddamn King Arthur table with and, and there's a couple of ladies and there's Dr. Eli Ginzberg, the man who was advisor to five of the U.S. presidents. I mean and there's this guy sitting here, there's a chair here, and there a guy sitting on his left.  And he had enough dandruff on his thing to start a snowstorm so I said, I said when I walked in I said, "Ooh it's, it's snowing in here."  And everybody said--I said, "Man you need Head and Shoulders," and some people said (laughter) and they stop and try to get back to being serious.  And, and I said, "I'm, I'm serious man," I said, "because you know" I, I said, "I'm telling you, I don't know why ain't nobody ain't told you that but that's for you."  I said, "Anyway let's get this interview started."  So I took total charge from jump street, and like the one guy says, "Oh I see you're in your--" 'cause you had to write papers.  You had to have somebody recommend you and write something and say why you should get this fellowship.  And you had to write what would you do if you got the fellowship and what have you done (laughter).  So they had all this other paperwork, so I had done all the writing and I got smart by getting a Jewish sister friend, a Jewish woman friend of mine to edit my shit.  Because I knew Jews were gonna be looking at it, so I wanted a Jewish touch, so she hooked me up, she hooked me up. 'Cause I wrote this stuff, it was my guts and entrails and everything but she laid that stuff down lovely.  And I knew that I would get a reading and so, so when they, they were reading the guy says, "Well according to what you, what you say when tell us you say you're, you're mother was your role model, I don't understand.  You seem like such a macho guy you know."  I said I said, "Oh my mother's a macho woman," (laughter) messed them up.  So Rhea [ph.] was the name of the woman who was the secretary for the Revson fellowship office, and I got my interview and gone.  When I walked in my door the phone was ringing, I picked up the phone, it was Rhea from the Revson Fellowship [Charles H. Revson Fellowship] office.  She says, "You seem like such a fun guy and today is Friday, and I wanted you to just party this weekend.  So I'm telling you now you've been selected."  I said, "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you."  And I partied baby, I said, "This is my apartment forever."  So that's how I ended up being here, that's how I ended up getting here and being here.  Thanks to Charles H. Revson (laughter).

Speaker 1: And what do you do there now?
Speaker 2: Now I do independent study from time to time. If you have a situation with cellular biology or something like that and you want somebody to help you with your paper, I might be the guy you might see.  'Cause the last teaching that I really have done here at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] was for the Science, Science Technology Entry Program, which is a precollege program for high school students who want to get into sciences.  And it's a science, a program to try to encourage blacks and Latins to get into science, cause that's one of the areas we feel a little squeamish and we're not too, too crazy about that.  We ain't Chinese you know and it's so sad, so what I, so what my job was, since I know all this, my thing was to and try to encourage as many as I could.  So they really brought me onto be a motivator and, and a teacher.  So I wrote biology wrap, I wrote invertebrate, vertebrae debate, I wrote a (unclear).  So you can breakdown the terms like mitochondria and endoplasm- endoplasmic reticulum, you know words just can't fit in our mouths.  So I try to write raps to kind of make it fun to do, and I told stories that made them characters, so we can get an idea of what the mitochondria is.  You know it's just a powerhouse, is the bad guy on the block, he can control the whole scene.  I mean I made up the story just to get them excited about it, and it worked I had a wonderful time, I've got a lot, I got some students now who are doctors, it worked.  I had a fantastic time, I took some of the baddest kids off, I had a kid named Carlos [ph.] who was a terror to the, to these East Indian, doctors up at, up on 168th at the Health and Science Building where I took, where I was teaching.  And everybody is walking around with a smock and they all teachers and they all think, you know they all upper-class.  And most of them are Asians, they really motherfuckers, and East Indians can be really terrible I mean they got some kind of, some British shit happening that's deep.  And it's, and he had this disdain for Carlos, but Carlos was a bad little kid, he was a thug and he'd do something wrong.  And I knew that, but you just gotta watch him, you know you can't be stupid, can't leave your bag on top of your desk you know whatever.  But he was causing problems I think he was talking to a girl in the class or something and the professor hated him.  So one day instead of using the light screen I, I use the blackboard, I had Carlos draw a brain 'cause we had talked about the brain.  So I said, "The cerebellum I want the medulla, I want the (unclear) I want the whole thing.  I want you to draw it just like it's in that book on the board," and it was so perfect, and I called the professor and I said, "You see that kid that you always talking about that he should be in jail, that you don't like?"  I said, "Look what he did."  "He did not do that."  I said he, I said, "He, he drew that."  "He don't know nothing about that."  I said, "He's knows all about it" 'cause as he was drawing it when we were talking about it.  I said, "You gotta watch what you say to these kids, 'cause there's a genius inside of these kids."  I said, "You're not giving it a shot, not giving it a chance." I said, "He's trying to be a good kid."  He says, "Ahh," (laughter).  He didn't want to hear it, but I proved my point, 'cause it was outstanding.
Story_ID: 364580
Speaker 1: Talk to me about The Last Poets' reunion remember it died off, then you, you know became pop- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Last Poets reunion came out, came by because of Gregory J. Reed, I think I mentioned the fact that he brought us back together.  But that was a short-lived reunion because Kain [Gylan Kain] wasn't moving from Amsterdam [the Netherlands].  David [David Nelson] he's here, a Black Hebrew, he's cool, he was down but you know he, that wasn't, he wasn't much of a problem.  Even though he did argue a lot about percentages of monies that we had not even made yet.  And Felipe [Felipe Luciano] was really becoming a problem with that because he was arguing about money, he said we had made also.  And I'm, my whole thing is I'm real practical I, we ain't made no money, why yall talking about money you know.  I mean everything is like ooh we going to just make money all of a sudden now because we're The Last Poets.  And there's this call to, to arms and we're gonna come back and just collect, I don't, I really didn't see, see it happening like that.  But I'm, I was still the youngest so I'm listening you know I'm going along with thing.  And MTV did a nice little bio and stuff you know there was a lot of stuff that was done that was nice.  And then we did our last gig together as original members of the group, and it's not even on that first album ['The Last Poets'], cause that's not the original members.  We did our last real big gig together at Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] for the twenty year anniversary of the killing of the National Guard, killing the student at Kent State.  And that was a hot gig, it was packed, we had a good time, we had a lot of fun.  But it was not cost effective to keep that group up because Kain was not gonna Amsterdam and so forth.  And then there was, and then we recorded, we have some cat from Motown [Motown Records Company, Detroit, Michigan] give us some tracks, it went to American Thread Company, Deodato's [ph.] studio down on American Thread Company.  And we recorded, and we had a bunch of headache throughout that recording because we argued on the phone with, with Gregory Reed about percentages.  And I didn't argue, but they did, they had it on speakerphone, they argued back and forth.  I'm talking about like for an hour, two hours, it was sick, so I just realized that this is not gonna work there's too many, too much, too much water has gone underneath the bridge for this you know to work.  So I, I decided that that, you know the effort was fine and dandy, but I got my life, I got jazz group, I got my theater company if I wanna revive it.  And I got, I got a lot of things going on, I don't have to, I don't need this.
Story_ID: 364581
Speaker 1: And then the bell rang and it was Umar Bin Hassan, and he knew that I'd been together with Kain [Gylan Kain], David [David Nelson] and Felipe [Felipe Luciano] in Detroit [Michigan].  He had heard all about it, the word had gotten out, and he felt slighted because he was in the second wave and he was from that hot album.  And, but he had gone on the drug binge and Jalal [Jalal Mansur Nuriddin] was over in France trying to be The Last Poet and so he wasn't actually in the mix.  But Umar felt really slighted and then he came here to the door, he run the bell and he says yo man.  I said damn I ain't seen you twenty years (laughter) where you been, so he said, and I, first I said I thought I heard you were in a shootout. Well a comedic guy that used to be an opening act for Diana Ross, a comedian.   He from, he's from the same town as Umar; he had heard that Umar was in a shootout and got killed.  So, but told the guy we he told me this, I said I don't believe Umar is dead, I said I don't feel that.  You know we were close enough for me to feel his, feel his departure, I just don't feel it.  But anyway when I saw him I wasn't totally surprised, but I was still wondering why he was at my door.  He said man we need to start The Last Poets up like it was in the beginning, you know just simple man, for the people, on the street with the drums, and I.  And I said well brother I work with the people all day, every day I'm a, I teach all over the place.  I said, and I'm writing and I said I don't know what, what we've done lately and you come miles talking about what, what have you done?  He kicked 'Bum Rush,' which one of his new poems and a poem called '42nd Street' [ph.], off the chain, off the chart.  I mean it was, they was so, it was the development of this brother that I help get started writing 'Niggers are Scared of Revolution' and watching that, seeing now that he is truly mastered his craft, mastered it, I was, I was knocked out.  I said wow, I said that's impressive, I said that's very good stuff, I had to give it to him, I gave, I got up, gave him some love, said yeah.  So I said well listen man I said I, I have a drummer in mind, he said I got one in mind too.  I said old boy we gone start out with conflict right away, just so happen we had the same drummer in mind, the same drummer, it was classics.  The brother who taught my son who's a lawyer now how to play, when Babatunde [Babatunde Olatunji] first saw me with my, when at Oba [Obadele Davis] was five.
Story_ID: 364582
Speaker 1: Babatunde [Babatunde Olatunji], I took him up to the dance city in Harlem [New York, New York] to go up there.  Because his mother and I were trying to get him into stuff you know we wanted our kid to play some instrument or something.  And Babatunde saw me he says you're, you're Abiodun [HistoryMaker Abiodun Oyewole], The Last Poets man, I quote your stuff, I know all your stuff.  I said man, I ain't got nothing to do with their right now, I want you to teach my son how to play the drums.  I said I don't want to hear that Last Poets stuff, and he and whenever he's interviewed with us he always says, "Yeah man I was telling Dun man when I first him with his kid.  He's we kept man you guys were the best and I know all of your work and," he didn't want to hear none of that.  All he wanted me to do say I was gonna teach his son how to play the drums.  And he said I taught him how to play, and that was true because he was in a big concert and he'd stand up there in five years old but the kalive [ph.] keeping the rhythm.  And if you play kalive, you, you better know what you're doing because that's the rhythm piece and I said so, and he and Babatunde very friends, very good friends.  And then when my son went to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], he started an African dance troupe.  And I had no idea he had done such a thing like that, 'cause I thought he was in pre-law and he was in Pennsylvania, which I thought would take up all his time.  And it was all stuff that he had learned when he was a little kid, he was passing it on.  And they were these six little beautiful girls come and say, "Your son, you, are you Obadele's [Obadele Davis] daddy?"  I said, "Ah yes."  "Well he taught us African drumming and dancing."  I said, "Naw you got the wrong Obadele."  I said, "My son's a pre-law student at Pennsylvania."  So I came home I said, "These girls come running talking about Obadele, I asked them if I was Obadele's daddy," and he taught.  And he said, "That's my group pops, those are my girls."  I said, "What?" I said, "You ain't told me this."  He said, "Yeah but I mean you know you, you took me to this school, you taught me, I learned all this stuff, I mean I used it."  I said, "You didn't tell me.  I didn't know you had a dance troupe," so he does things on the down-low he doesn't ask for a bunch of, he's an Aries, he's a quiet Aries, he just does stuff (laughter) he just gets stuff done.
Story_ID: 364583
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So do you still perform now, just the you--
Speaker 2: No, now, now since Umar [Umar Bin Hassan] came back into my life (laughter) and we hooked up with Babatunde [Babatunde Olatunji] this has been without question the greatest period of The Last Poets.  There is no two ways about it, the only thing that we can't capture is the spirit and the energy and the electricity.  We can't capture the electricity of the moment that we created when we first--I can't be who I was on that first album ['The Last Poets'].  I, and no my even if I tried, it would be silly for me to even try, because the energy was so raw, it was like, it was like taking a, a blade out of the fire and just you know using it right there.  With the flame being on the blade you, and, and it's so hot you can't stand it, and whatever it touches, it's gonna cut through without any problem.  That's how we were, that's how we were with the voice, my voice was cutting like that, we got the energy was like that.  Our, our desires were, were very powerful in terms of our desire to make our message heard and, and the clarity of all that.  It was that zone that you were in without any distraction, you, we were focused on the mission of revolution and through the poetry.  And it came across when you heard us, and now we have become mature and wise, we're fathers, we've grown.  We still got the passion we still got the ability, the skills may even be better, but that electricity of that moment can't recaptured, and that's the only thing.  If I have anything to be jealous of it's myself.  Because when we sell stuff the people will get on line and tell you I want the first album right away.  So we know when we go places we gotta have a lot of stock of the very first CD.  'Cause that shit is still hot.
Speaker 1: What are you talking about now that you were not talking about?  Well how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What are we talking about--
Speaker 1: Becoming wise and a man and a father, what do you talk about now?
Speaker 2: As opposed to seeing our movement strictly as a black nationalist poetry ensemble, we see us as, we see ourselves as the, last vestige of humanity.  And we see our movement as humanity versus inhumanity. And I make it clear from the stage that we got some black inhumane people that need to down into the incinerator along with them white folks.  I said you got some white folks who are angels who work with you, I said so we have come to that understanding, we have met angels in all shades and sizes.  And we're here to endorse that, our concern always starts with family, so when we our poetry, do our poetry, it's coming from a black place.  And anytime, and if you're coming from a black place, you have no, there's no reason to feel ashamed that this is coming 'cause that's where you're from.  And then you really start to share it, and start to travel, you realize that everytime you cover a black place, it's universal.  It's, all universal, so we, we have, we have increased our audience tremendously, we've been all over the world and plans to take us further places is in the works.  We're doing outrageous, outrageous stuff in terms of making connections with young people, and the poetry is the only salvation in the world right now for most of the young people, especially.
