Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I left, I left Ann Arbor [Michigan] in 1991-- Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: --I think it was. And then I finished my dissertation while I was living here in Chicago [Illinois]. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: So, but I moved here in 1991, and that was the moment that Clarence Thomas was being nominated for the [U.S.] Supreme Court. And I was involved in another national mobilization called African American Women in Defense of Ourselves, which really tried to add a different voice to the debate around Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. Anita Hill, of course, was the person that accused him of sexual harassment and almost derailed his appointment to the Supreme Court, and she was vilified as someone, you know, who was not trustworthy--she was making this up, she was trying to bring a black man down--and it was a very simplified formula because, of course, Clarence Thomas had, in many ways betrayed the interests of most black people long before Anita Hill's accusations, which I think were quite credible, came to the fore. Speaker 1: What voices in the black media were putting this case together, that she was dragging down--? Speaker 2: I don't remember all the names. I do remember Orlando Patterson from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] wrote a piece in The New York Times which was pretty troubling, describing his take on black male/female relations and framing this alleged sexual harassment in that context. And what his position was, was essentially that this was, that what Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of was a kind of flirtation that was common, and that she should have known that this was harmless flirtation, and not kind of outed him.

People are hurting today and they don't necessarily want you to solve their problems. They just want a place to go to be heard sometimes. I think women are gonna bring an uncommon compassion that comes out of their own rejection in a society that's not prepared for women, that's gonna make a difference in--it's gonna make ministry, ministries of compassion a lot more readily available in churches that are filled with people who have drug and alcohol or problems, problems of spousal abuse, of child abuse and many other issues, the women are gonna enrich these ministries. Not that the men cannot do those things. Don't get me wrong. I have benefited from male leadership, both in the church--my own pastor, Dr. H. Beecher Hicks has been, is still my spiritual mentor.
