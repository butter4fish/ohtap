I mean, nobody really realized that the State job [Secretary of the Illinois Department of Human Services] was the first time I ever had one; and that me and the governor [Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich] weren't exactly hanging out, you know. But they get two people who have had these kinds of jobs-[HM] Wayne [Watson] from the city, me from the state. They said, ""Hey, what happened to all the other candidates, and why didn't we have a role?"" You know, and then it turned into just a massive mud-slinging about both candidates and about the process, and about there being a process that wasn't open--that didn't allow them to have a voice. And I think for some, it wouldn't have mattered who the candidates were at the end of the day--they didn't have a voice. Then they also said, ""How did you get applications from all over the world and end up with two people right from our backyard, you know?"" So folks characterized them, and both of us, in a very negative way. For me, I had had a situation at the Department of Human Services where I fired someone who subsequently brought a sexual harassment suit against my chief of staff. I did not fire the chief of staff; I placed them on leave pending the outcome of the investigation. It went to trial, they won. In other words, the chief of staff was upheld that there was no sexual harassment and all that, and she was allowed to come back to her job. But the person, one of the people associated with this, was also associated with a group of people at Chicago State. So, when this thing came up, all of this came back. They said, ""Hey, here's this woman who let somebody who was accused of sexual harassment stay on her job. And she didn't fire them and she didn't do this, and she had drivers... and she did this and that."" And all of that came up, and so there was a big whole negative thing. Subsequently I didn't get it, and not necessarily because of that, but you know... I didn't get it. Because both candidates were equally castigated, so I can't say I didn't get it because of castigation. But I didn't get the appointment. So, I still worked for Human Services, because unlike what a lot of people said, I wasn't fired, I wasn't looking for a job. I was approached, and I was interested in the job and decided to go for it. So-- Speaker 1: Was this the first time that you had been subject to-- Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: --public castigation?

Speaker 2: Yeah, I, you know, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is different and unique. I think he has done a lot of good things, and people just don't know because they can't hear it because they see and hear other things that he says. And I think it is important for him to really get people to understand who he really is and about. It might not be important to him as it is for us or for me in particular, but I think he has some things that he can let our community know so they just don't always hear that hard line. That, that's one thing and that's one thing that I've shared with him because I think that's important. I think Condi Rice [Condoleeza Rice] is absolutely fabulous. I think that people respect her for who she is. She is brilliant, knows what she's doing, and I don't think she always follows that hard line. Again, and if she does, it's the way it's presented and I think that some of our black Republicans that are hard lines that people may know like Clarence Thomas or whatever, it's all how we present, you know, and all how we carry our self and all how we give to the community or don't, and people don't see him giving to the community. They see him following that hard line just so he can be a token or whatever people might want to call him because I'm sure you've heard those names that they call him. But, I think there's more to him than that if he just would reach out a little bit more I think that would help. Story_ID: 70034 Speaker 1: What, what would you--do you have maybe an example of something that maybe he [Clarence Thomas] has done. I, I don't what to make this just about him, but you mentioned that he's done some things that pe--people don't know about. Are those in the context of being a Supreme Court Justice? Speaker 2: I think there, there's a couple of things. I think some of his decisions are right on time. You know looking at them and stuff like that and I try to keep up with it 'cause I like history and, and things like that that go on. I think one thing is like a personal thing or family thing where he's, you know, adopted or taken in one of his relative's child because they just couldn't do it. Because we always as black folks tend to take care of each other and our families or we used to a lot, but that's something that people may not know, and this kid loves Clarence Thomas. He's gotten to do things that he said that he would never do or would have a chance to do as far as getting a good educa--better education, you know, doing some social things, going away, travelling, you know, with the Justice, those type of things. But, actually to adopt one of your relative's children I think that's, that's something special. And that's something real important that people just don't know because it's not shared out there, and it might be 'cause it is personal and I understand that. But, on the other hand, that's a different side of Clarence Thomas that people just don't know. I think the other thing is that he tends to outreach, but maybe not in our community per se because he goes to a lot of schools and does a lot of speaking you know. He mentors a lot of people you know, and again I think that that's the side that people don't see. Speaker 1: Okay, people--I think he's mainly criticized for his performance as a Supreme Court Justice-- Speaker 2: Right. Speaker 1: --which has drawn critique of him--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: Exactly. Oh yeah, absolutely. Speaker 1: --and other civil rights--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: And I think too the whole Anita Hill thing did not help. Correct me if I'm wrong. I think that people took issue to that, that he was really downing a black women, you know, those type of things and, and they just had a real hard time with that. And I don't think people even knew Clarence Thomas as much after, until that really happened. Speaker 1: Right--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: And that was a negative issue. Speaker 1: Yeah, and that, that happened as he was being introduced to the--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: Exactly. Speaker 1: He wasn't a well-known figure.

Again, and if she does, it's the way it's presented and I think that some of our black Republicans that are hard lines that people may know like Clarence Thomas or whatever, it's all how we present, you know, and all how we carry our self and all how we give to the community or don't, and people don't see him giving to the community. They see him following that hard line just so he can be a token or whatever people might want to call him because I'm sure you've heard those names that they call him. But, I think there's more to him than that if he just would reach out a little bit more I think that would help. Story_ID: 70034 Speaker 1: What, what would you--do you have maybe an example of something that maybe he [Clarence Thomas] has done. I, I don't what to make this just about him, but you mentioned that he's done some things that pe--people don't know about. Are those in the context of being a Supreme Court Justice? Speaker 2: I think there, there's a couple of things. I think some of his decisions are right on time. You know looking at them and stuff like that and I try to keep up with it 'cause I like history and, and things like that that go on. I think one thing is like a personal thing or family thing where he's, you know, adopted or taken in one of his relative's child because they just couldn't do it. Because we always as black folks tend to take care of each other and our families or we used to a lot, but that's something that people may not know, and this kid loves Clarence Thomas. He's gotten to do things that he said that he would never do or would have a chance to do as far as getting a good educa--better education, you know, doing some social things, going away, travelling, you know, with the Justice, those type of things. But, actually to adopt one of your relative's children I think that's, that's something special. And that's something real important that people just don't know because it's not shared out there, and it might be 'cause it is personal and I understand that. But, on the other hand, that's a different side of Clarence Thomas that people just don't know. I think the other thing is that he tends to outreach, but maybe not in our community per se because he goes to a lot of schools and does a lot of speaking you know. He mentors a lot of people you know, and again I think that that's the side that people don't see. Speaker 1: Okay, people--I think he's mainly criticized for his performance as a Supreme Court Justice-- Speaker 2: Right. Speaker 1: --which has drawn critique of him--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: Exactly. Oh yeah, absolutely. Speaker 1: --and other civil rights--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: And I think too the whole Anita Hill thing did not help. Correct me if I'm wrong. I think that people took issue to that, that he was really downing a black women, you know, those type of things and, and they just had a real hard time with that. And I don't think people even knew Clarence Thomas as much after, until that really happened. Speaker 1: Right--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: And that was a negative issue. Speaker 1: Yeah, and that, that happened as he was being introduced to the--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: Exactly. Speaker 1: He wasn't a well-known figure. Speaker 2: No, he had been a lot of things that, you know, as far as judge, you know, he had been a judge. He ran the EEOC, you know, those type of things. So, he had a lot of other policies out there too that people just were not aware of. But, I think that whole hearing thing brought things to a head. Speaker 1: And I think some of his stances against affirmative action. Speaker 2: Oh absolutely, absolutely. And when people said that he benefitted from affirmative action and then he turned against affirmative action. Speaker 1: Yeah, was that--do you see that as pretty much true? Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think that's true to a certain extent, but I also think that we need to really, you know, do some things on our own too, that we don't always have to beg and, and get, you know, people giving us stuff constantly, you...",Anita Hill,,,1/1/2000,,,USA,N,,yes,"Amoore, Renee HM0",,,,,,,,,,Black or African American,,,

And so, we, we saw large numbers of investigations, of the cases in which the media would, would participate as judge, jury, prosecutor of African American elected officials and numbers disproportionate to their white counter parts, as their numbers were swelling, all types of things, the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] was involved, but patterns of singling out African Americans, Afri- African American elected officials for harassment that would either deter them, side track them, in some instances cause them to go out of office.

But my husband was just quoting a statistic for me that in this century there are more girls who have been terminated either prenatally or in infanticide in society. And there have been men who have been killed in wars. So we're still living in an age where people prefer to give birth to males, so much so that in China, you know, the population is--it is not normally balanced in males and females. And someone has to stop and realize this is not--this doesn't make sense for the long-term health of a society. So as long as we're still living in a world in which there's infanticide of girls and women, we know that we're not educating our population well enough, and we know that it's still a danger to be a female in this and in many societies. All you have to do is look at some of the recent incidents in India and the rapes that occurred there. People have to stand up and realize that this is not a healthy and productive way to move forward in society. And that's contrasted in elite institutions, such as Tufts University, where more than 50 percent, generally, now it's moving more towards 60 percent, of the people accepted are women.

And I noticed there was a man on the elevator, but I got on anyway. And he was in back of me and he walked over and he pressed the ninth floor. And I again, intuitively, cause that's unusual. Why would he be pushing nine? If he wanted to go to nine, he would have gotten off before it got to thirteen. But anyway, when it got to nine, he grabbed me and took me off of the elevator and was carrying me towards the stairwell when I decided that I had to fight, I had to break away because I, I knew that if he took me in the stairwell, nobody was going to be walking down, if the elevators were working. It might be days before somebody found their way to the stairwells on the ninth floor. So, I started to fight, and I was able to break away from him. But the, the tragedy of that story is, is not as much what happened to me with the attack, but what happened to me in the aftermath, and that is how I was treated by policemen afterwards. I ran into someone's apartment, and then they got my parents and they started to look for this guy, and, and of course, my father started to look for this guy. And I was afraid that he (little laughter) would find him. But I went on to work that day, and later the police detectives came by my job to question me about this attack. And they showed you mug shots of people that had done things in the community. And it could have been anything. It could have been robbery or anything but they were just showing me pictures of men who had, who had crime in the neighborhood. And I knew a lot of them because I had lived in this community all of my life. And so I'd say, ""Oh, is that Larry? What did he do?"" You know, just very naively, and this apparently made them think that, that I was an unsavory character. And so they started to imply that somehow it was my fault that I had been attacked. And what kinds of promises had I made to boys in school and all these sorts of things.

And then as Anita Hill's testimony went on, the women, as you know, became more and more enraged really about not just what had happened to her, not just the sexual harassment that she had experienced, but the fact that the members of the committee just didn't seem to get it that this was a major economic issue for women. And at the time, I remember having conversation after conversation that most professional women who have worked in the workplace had had some incident of sexual harassment. Everybody had a story of, you know, the boss who, you know, touched their breasts or their back or their legs or something, or who, you know, asked them out for dates or whatever. So this was something that resonated with women across the board. And the fact that there were no women in the Senate. Well, there were two at the time: we had Nancy Kassebaum on the Republican side, Barbara Mikulski on the Democratic side and that was really it.

And the reason is that when you have people in positions of power that come from different constituencies that make up the polity, make up the community as a whole, what you wind up doing is, if you are stirring the pot a little bit, you get the benefit of different experiences, different perspective, and different points of view. And once you get the benefit of everybody's perspective and points of view, you make better policy, because the policy then is more reality-based.

So it wound up being a year-long hiatus between the time that I lost reelection and the time I actually got off to New Zealand and was confirmed by the Senate. It was about a year, with machinations back and forth, this guy trying to stay in place, and this, that, and the other. But the real thing came with Jesse Helms, and this is my, you know, Jesse Helms, my worst enemy, my best friend, right, because he didn't want to call my nomination. So this kid reporter from Roll Call wanted to talk to me. I wouldn't talk to him. He then went over to the Senate to speak with Jesse Helms. Helms, in addition to running over the kid's foot with his wheelchair, told the kid, ""I'm not going to call her nomination 'til she apologizes for what she did on the Confederate flag."" Well, that was like the best thing he could have said because the whole country went, ""Gasp."" The sense of outrage in Washington was so overwhelming about the Confederate flag thing that Jesse Helms was forced to call my nomination. Then when he called it, he said, ""She's not going to get confirmed because she's got all these ethical clouds hanging over her, all this stuff that had been written about in the papers,"" that you referenced a little bit. And so, he called the hearing, with like a two week period of time and then sent out subpoenas to every entity in Washington that would have had any dealings with me whatsoever. So the Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Election Commission, the White House, the Senate Ethics Board, everybody got subpoenas from Jesse Helms about their dealings with me. But it turned out to be a really good thing because his subpoenas exonerated me more than I ever knew, than I would have ever been able to do on my own. I have never been fined or anything, had any sanction for any of my conduct at any level of government. But I was particularly pleased to find that with the FEC, Federal Election Commission, they had dismissed my case.

And so when my grandmother, I guess, started to show, she was spirited away and gave birth in New Jersey and it wasn't until seven years later that my mom moved in with her mother and became a part of her family, because she had been--she was raised in a boarding house in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] with a woman who wasn't very warm and wasn't very loving, but who took care of her.

Story_ID: 3880 Speaker 1: It was during that time that--I think it was before [Colonel] Queen left, but I'm not quite sure, I was asked to head up a band of Italian partisans to reconnaissance and intelligence work. We were to go behind the German lines, try to find out where troop concentration and mine fields, artillery units were located; try to find out what their patro--petrol situation was, how much gasoline and oil they had to move their tanks and etc; find out how much food they had, what their morale was and to send that information back and (unclear) entry to Division Headquarters. It was gruesome, scary assignment, important assignment. And I gained a great respect for the Italian partisans who were made up mainly of, of men who opposed [Benito] Mussolini, who was the head of the Italian, who was the head of Italy really, and who worked in conjunction with Adolf Hitler during World War II. And they were men whose villages had been ransacked by the Germans, their women raped, their mothers abused, their children taken away for work, and nothing left in the town but old men because all the horses and cows and any livestock were taken by the Germans. So when we came to a town that was completely ravaged, and these men were men who were fighting and who were bitter and had, full of hatred for the Germans. They were cutting and they were shrewd. They knew the terrain because it was their country, and they lived there. And they were very courageous and brave. Working with them was quite an experience. I had one unfortunate experience, however, because they never wanted to take prisoners. They felt so strongly and hated them so much. And we came across--they came across one young German and they captured him. And they frisked him and they found a picture, as I'm told, of his girlfriend, and they did obscene with it and what not. And I was further told that he tried to run away. I seriously doubt that. No way for him to run away. They had stripped him of everything. And anyway, they killed him. They put a bayonet in him.

I said, ""Well, if we could do it, I would. "" That was the end of the conversation. I then went to Lieutenant Jung, a fellow by the name of Jung, big strapping, strong, muscle-bound man. I can't remember his first name. His name was Jung, sort of reddish hair, short cropped. And I asked him to, to lead the patrol. He was a second lieutenant at that time. I was a first lieutenant. I had been promoted to first lieutenant. And we went through with it in a patrol. He took the troops over, very bravely, very courageously and went down the hill, just as we'd planned it. And we had our machine guns and everything on this, on this hill. And his mission was to go over to this hill and catch them by patrol, which they did. They were sleeping, caught them by surprise, and they started firing. And they pulled back, but they pulled back on a wide front cause they thought it was a major attack, which, of course, it wasn't. By that time, he had, had called back to us and we then sent our troops in and secured the land. That was called Mal Faeto. Colonel Ferguson recommended me for the Silver Star, and I think Jung for either the Silver Star or Bronze Star or something, never got it. Never, never got it. That's, that's not the important part of the story. The important part of the story is that it saved a lot of lives because they had been doing this, not only where we were, but in other sectors in which they were involved, that they'd send their troops wave after wave after wave to almost certain death. Well, that's a horrible thing to say, but that's what happened, almost certain death. And it sent their calling card in advance, so it was an old strategy which, if it ever worked, never worked well for us. That's Mal Faeto, still there. Speaker 1: And how do you spell that?

When I first got on the bench, there would be these lawyers who would come in and say, ""Well, you know, my client grew up without a father. He was poor."" And I would just lose it. I'd say, ""You know what? Being poor, growing up without a father is no excuse for shooting somebody. I was poor. I didn't have a dad. I never once hurt anybody or stole from them."" So, my philosophy is what my [maternal] grandmother [Eunice Bailey Banks] taught me. You have to be accountable for your choices. You make a bad choice, you got to deal with the consequence of it. That doesn't mean that you can't move forward from that, but there's not going to be any of this patting on your back, saying, oh, sorry, you know, you get another chance.

The second time I ran, they did not run anybody against me, so people were shocked that I was stepping down. But I'd al- I've always been one of those people guided by, where can I make the biggest difference? And, quite honestly, I was just getting burned out on the court. It was, it, the depravity that I was seeing every day, it just, I wasn't able to leave it at the office. And I'd always promised myself that when I reached the point where I couldn't see the humanity in the person across the bench from me, it was time for me to go. My youngest [David Brown] was four, my middle daughter [Laura Brown] was fourteen. It was time for me to go. And I started having quiet conversations with people, imagining I would just transition to a law firm. And Nationwide Children's, one of my friends was on the board and Nationwide Children's asked me to come and talk to them. And they wanted to create a one stop child abuse center because they had children who were sexually abused, spending hours in the emergency room, sometimes eight, ten, twelve hours waiting on detectives to get there, waiting on children's services to get there. So, they basically said, ""This is kind of what we're thinking, but we'd like you with your experience to come in and design it."" And so, I literally got the opportunity to plan, program, and build a center from the ground up. They had originally told me I had $3 million. I, I ultimately got $10 million, and we built a forty-two thousand square foot facility that, now in Franklin County [Ohio], we've been open now for, since 2005 for seven years. So, we have literally changed the paradigm on how you treat abused children. What we did is we moved all of the systems that deal with seriously abused children into one location. This beautiful building looks like you're walking into somebody's living room. It doesn't look like a hospital. It doesn't look institutional. We moved our five child abuse physicians, nurse practitioners, eight trauma treatment therapists, seventeen detectives from our special victims bureau at the Columbus police department [Columbus Division of Police], ten children services investigators, two Franklin County prosecutors, a domestic violence therapist, a child psychiatrist, and the Columbus Coalition Against Family Violence [The Center for Family Safety and Healing, Columbus, Ohio] all in one location, all working together. It took us two years just to get the memorandums of understanding completed. But what--it's amazing what happens when you take six organizations that are used to pointing the finger at each other, which is what they used to do when I was on the bench; the police would blame children's services. Children's services would blame the prosecutor as to why nothing happened. But now, instead of being this anonymous name on a phone message, it's the person you see in the parking lot. It's the person you get coffee with in the morning. So, the beauty of this is that when a child is raped, they come to the center, and everybody they need to see is at the center: the detective's there, the children's services worker is here, the physician is there. We immediately get them into trauma treatment with a therapist. And so, oftentimes, the police detective is able to go and interview the alleged perpetrator before the mom can get home and say, oh, my god, this is what they found. So, it's a wonderful system. It was the work of my life. It's what I thought I was going to end my career doing. And then, Governor Strickland [Ted Strickland] called in 2010 (laughter). Speaker 1: Yeah.

Well you know in some ways Derek Bell's wife, whose first name I'm not remembering and Doris, whose name I'm not remembering who was in the admissions office at Radcliffe [College, now merged with Harvard University], were probably more of a personal influence. I mean, I think that Martin Kilson had a much bigger impact on the boys than on the young women. And it was interesting. I took his course and--the Political Science course, and he--he had all of us write about politics in our home town. So I went--I went back home [Indianapolis, Indiana], I guess over Christmas break, and I interviewed a lot of the older black politicians and, you know, wrote my paper for him. And that was a very smart thing for him because he was looking at black agency and power in cities all over the country. But he really was much more of a mentor to the young men and I hear them even now talk about their conversations with him. But, you know, he was a little--he was a little bit problematic for the girls. And you know later he had this sexual harassment suit and there were some of my, you know, some of my friends who were a little bit traumatized by him.

And then my contract was up and ABC had been pursuing me, I'd been having conversations with them. At that point, NBC cable was really just starting. I mean, CNN was around but the networks didn't have cable operations and at that point ABC had more news programing, more successful news programing. And so I made the decision to go to ABC in 1989 as a producer with ""World News Tonight with Peter Jennings"".

It was very hard to keep going to these homes and ask families for photographs of their loved ones who had been killed in a drive-by shooting or who had been molested by their teacher or who had been hit by a car. That, I have a very compassionate spirit, so I take that with me at home. And it was very hard, and it began chip away at who I was.

You know, I would go, and I would go into some of the projects in some of the most dangerous neighborhoods. And I'd be climbing up stairs in dark and hoping I wouldn't get shot or attacked with a cameraman, going to get pictures and talk to people, and hoping I wasn't gonna get beat up, coming to a crime scene very soon after, and it does happen to reporters and cameramen, things do happen like that.

Mississippi passed a lot of rules that they called the blue codes and they were against interracial marriage and so forth. They, they took away the power of Reconstruction they nullified it and so all of the accomplishments that had been given to blacks or freedoms or rights that came with emancipation got vitiated you know.

Speaker 2: Not particularly. Um, I, my mother [Georgia Ann Jones] felt like education was the way out. I rebelled quite a bit. For reasons unknown to me, you know, I would sometimes get very bored in school and was a little bit disruptive. It wasn't until about the eighth grade that, you know, I was trying to mimic some of the protests that I would see on television, and I recall at the time at Knoxville Junior High that girls were only allowed to wear slacks on snow days. And I decided to hold a protest at the cafeteria, with signs, with my girlfriends saying that we ought to be able to wear pants too. And I was so dismayed that our school newspaper didn't cover it. So I marched into the English teacher and told her, I said, ""How could you not put this in the newspaper? This is the biggest thing to happen at the school since pizza in the cafeteria."" So, I just displayed my outrage. And she said, ""Well, if you're so smart, why don't you work on the paper?"" And so I started working on the school newspaper, and I found my passion, I found my voice. I was actually able to write about things, the school, that I thought all the kids cared about.

For example, when I got to this market, still in the early '80s [1980s], you had a woman on the air and they had a promo calling her 'Girl on the Go', showing her legs running up City Hall. It was ridiculous the way women were viewed and treated by management at the time. Speaker 1: Yeah. It's since been, what is it, the Mary Tyler Moore show, and it's been parodied in the movies a lot, you know, the 'Anchorman' movie (unclear). Speaker 2: Exactly. Speaker 1: But a lot of those--I've heard stories from news people that really, I've heard some horrendous stories. Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I mean George Borzan [ph.] who was the anchor man at KZAZ at the time would actually--there were three women in the newsroom, and we were all sort of at this, it looked like a bar with typewriters. We were on stools typing, and he would go down the line and snap our bra straps, you know, just to intimidate us. During those days, we didn't even know about sexual harassment. You just knew if you wanted to keep your job, you would shut up and put up with it. And he would say things like ""I don't understand why there's so many women in this newsroom."" He said, ""News coming from a woman's mouth sounds like gossip."" That's what he said to us, bold to our faces.

I really could not wait, you know, to see the look on his face when I was eventually promoted to news director before leaving. But it was interesting, because over a two year period, I was working all kinds of jobs. It was a small newsroom where you would shoot and edit, you know, your own tape.

And I'm like, where the hell did I come to? I mean, why did I choose this place where there's so much racial, you know, tension. And this old guy in the back of the room got up and started screaming, ""The niggers just need to leave, they just need to leave."" And I'm stunned. I mean, first of all, I've gone my whole colored career in Arizona without ever hearing anybody say the 'N' word. And I'd come to Virginia and I was just stunned stupid. I thought, oh my gosh. There was Doug Wilder, who was a state senator at the time, who would later become governor. Every year he was going before the general assembly trying to get them to ratify MLK [Martin Luther King] Day, and every year they're saying no, but they wanted to celebrate Lee Jackson Day. Eventually this state, which is the seat of the confederacy in Richmond [Virginia], married the confederate soldier and MLK Day into one big day, Lee Jackson King Day. It was an insult to the African Americans in this state, but that was the only way that they could get the legislation through, to put the confederate general and MLK on the same day, and then they celebrated Lee Jackson King Day for years, until the holidays were eventually separated. So now MLK Day is on a Monday and Lee Jackson Day is on a Friday in the state of Virginia. Speaker 1: That's incredible. I didn't know that and--Lee Jackson King Day.

Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Story_ID: 38960 Speaker 1: Now what were the highlights of your stay there [WVEC, Norfolk, Virginia]? Speaker 2: Oh gosh. Again, it has to do with military and politics, because at the beginning of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, I went to Saudi Arabia, to Dhahran to cover the beginning of the war. It was also a time of politics, with Chuck Robb. You might remember that there was the infamous story of him sharing a glass of champagne in a bathrobe with then Miss Virginia, and he was married to Linda, ah-- Speaker 1: Johnson? Speaker 2: Yeah, Robb. And so there was a lot of brouhaha about that, especially since she posed in Playboy Magazine after that incident and came to Norfolk, and about a thousand people lined up to have her sign their magazine. So there was an editorial debate in our newsroom at the time about whether or not we should cover a story because of a woman who claimed to have shared a hotel room with then senator Robb, or was it Governor Robb at the time? So anyway, there was this scandal surrounding politics. I think that happened a lot during that era. And of course Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, and then I went back after Desert Storm and stayed in the same barracks, or quarters, that were later blown up in Dhahran, the Towers. So, politics, military--that would certainly be the highlight of some of the coverage. And then I decided to focus on the civil rights movement here in Virginia. Until I came to Virginia, I didn't know a lot about the Norfolk 17 and I didn't know a lot about, you know, massive resistance that occurred in this state, and how they actually shut down all the schools rather than integrate them.

They just couldn't be together. That twisted into something else when I found out that my birth father was white and a whole realm of possibilities that I hadn't considered came into view for me. And, and you know I, I know that speaks to my own stuff you know. I, I had never thought my birth mother could possibly have been raped or taken advantage of even when I thought my father was black. When I found out he was white I thought about those things. What I didn't think was that they could have just been in love so that speaks to my own upbringing I guess. But as it turns out you know when I met Cookie [Clarke's biological mother, Carole Cole], I think she, she, she was in love. She had a huge crush on Stanley Goldberg.

And she was you know in becoming president of Smith she was lauded as the first black woman to you know, to head a school of that caliber near Ivy [Ivy League] caliber. And, and I was just incredibly proud of Smith in bringing her in because to be quite honest, I was not a huge fan of the Smith College experience at the time I was there.

But African American students or black students, including international students, we probably represented hovering around 10 percent, maybe it was like eight, which wasn't a bad number as paltry as it is for the time.

Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts], one of the things I loved about it and, and that drew me was that we didn't have these cold dorms.

They grow all kinds of other things, particularly corn and you know, the dirt is not the black dirt or the red dirt of Greenville [Mississippi] and Benoit [Mississippi].

And Daddy--you know, neither one of them wanted to stay down in the country. So Daddy had gone up to Detroit [Michigan] when they started opening up the ironworkers' union. And Daddy wanted to be a welder. But, you know, in those days if you recall history, the leadership of an organization would say, ""I want to integrate."" And they would put African Americans down with this--the floor supervisor. The foreman or whatever. And those men generally harassed you terribly. And Daddy was harassed. And he tried to hold his temper but he's a man who does not suffer fools gladly. So he decked a supervisor. And of course that's an absolute--that was an absolute no-no. We're talking about in the '40s [1940s]. And he wound up being blacklisted. So that meant he could not get a job in any kind of blue collar profession in Detroit. So he and Mother went up to Minnesota where the railroad jobs were open. But he's--and there my mother tells the story that he came home one day and said he'd been fired. And Mother said, ""Why?"" And, in essence, because he didn't pay. He stopped paying for his job. The black men who were working then had to pay the union boss, the union supervisor to keep their jobs. And Daddy had gotten mad and decided he wasn't gonna pay 'em any more. So he got fired. So he came home and told mother the story and my mother was incensed. She made him go back, pay the man, apologize so he could get his job back. And you know, in hindsight you'd say, ""Oh Ma, that was so awful.

And he didn't believe me but I made it real clear. I said to him, I said, ""How will you explain to the folks downstairs how you got all those scratches on your face? 'Cause I will hurt you."" You know, sometimes I could be more bravado than there really is. But I was serious. But the point is that that happens. And some women can handle it and some can't. I didn't need a lawsuit. I didn't need a newspaper story. I just needed this turkey to get it straight. That he was not gonna hurt me. 'Cause I was gonna hurt him. But the sexism in the Urban League was rampant. When I was in the Washington Bureau [starting in 1991] one of the things that I did start talking about to our execs was sex harassment. And what that meant, and what that could mean to them. They used to make jokes. ""How you know how that feels? How do you describe sexism?"" I said, ""I--let's put it this way. If that person next to you had done that or said that to your mother, how would you have felt? If it was wrong for your mother, then it's wrong. If you can't accept the explanation, put your mother, your wife or your daughter in the category. And if they--you would be offended if this happened to them, then it's wrong."" And then it was shortly after that, we had a male exec sued. Several male execs were sued subsequently. But right after that conversation. And then we had a female exec sued. And I began to talk about the fact that, ""Ladies it's coming to you too."" And you know, they were sitting back there so few in numbers, they didn't believe this. But one of our female execs was sued for a sex harassment. And unfortunately I would say to them that, ""You know, it's not what you're doing, but it looks like you're doing."" And she would always take these nice young looking guys out for a drink after work. She thought that was nice. That was fun. ""Don't do that lady. You've got to be careful. Don't do that man. You've got to be careful."" We had one person, his story hit the newspapers right after that. He was dating some woman on staff. And he didn't show the night before because the wife had priority. And the woman had fixed his favorite food, which was spaghetti. She came the next morning with a pot of spaghetti and dumped it on his head. And that was the beginning.

I mean, I did well at it, but then when I got to the senior level and I'd look up in the higher ranks, and I said, you know, I had this feeling of, you know, doing deals and, and being this power player in some corporate setting, but it didn't feel like finance and that wasn't it. But I--it was what I knew. So I stayed in it for a while, did a stint in HR [Human Resources], got recruited out for the people skill stuff.

Finance is black and white, so either your product is wrong or it's right, it makes sense, or it doesn't, it's logical or it's not. In say merchandising, which is a different part of the company, a lot of your development is placed on social skills, and if you as a young black woman can't come in and socialize effectively with the young, your younger white counterparts, the upper management sees that as a--as a click, you know, a check that you can't really function out--because they wanna be able to see you as buyers. Merchandising, they're training you to be a buyer, and if they don't feel like you can get along with all sorts of people and, you know, so on and so forth, that's sort of a ding on your development.

And as executive vice president in provost we did some wonderful things. Speaker 1: Now what was the biggest challenge I guess at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] when you were there? Speaker 2: The biggest challenge. I guess the biggest challenge was probably changing the image in that people thought basically as a black school and not necessarily as a very good educational institution. So, you know, there always would be little snippets in the papers. Little negatives about, you know, that would it occur at [College of] William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia] that would never even hit the papers. But always if it was something related to Hampton, the negatives got in, and very few of the positives. You know if say somebody raped someone. Well even though the student might not have--or the person may not have ever graduated from Hampton, if they ever went there, in their lifetime, then, you know, it was mentioned as, ""Hampton somebody some--,"" you know. And so getting rid of the negatives related to the fact that this is a black institution and it's mediocre. To the fact that it's a great college education. It's a great university education. Changing really the image. The papers now give the positive things that are happening. The entire perception of Hampton over the last twenty years has changed significantly.

The story that struck me most about his growing up in St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands] is that he was a kid when the United States purchased the Virgin Islands [Danish West Indies; U.S. Virgin Islands] from Denmark. That happened in 1917, so he was about ten. And he said the American soldiers came in and ran amuck. He said they were getting drunk, and raping women, and just carrying on.

He remembers the meeting and remembers the purpose of the meeting, which was to address these, you know, guys who were running amuck. He said well, the next day, an American soldier was found with his throat cut. And the day after that another was found. And he said this went on for two weeks. And he said that stopped. He said soldiers running amuck stopped. So my father to me--and again, this is through the eyes of a kid was the complete opposite of my mother.

Because once you can get in Guam, you don't have to go through customs anymore.

And I also iden- identified some of the places where they were getting this material--got the statistics about how many of them were being shipped out to San Diego [California] drug rehab program. And, so I did a whole series of stories about it. And the U.S. military started harassing me. Being that I was a civilian, they couldn't come into my apartment. But they would sit their U.S. military car out in front of my house, and, oh, and see who was coming in and out. So, I had started getting word from some of my guys in the military.

Speaker 2: No, not as a child. I didn't--I really, really wanted to be a writer and the only way that I knew to make a living as a writer was a journalist. I think if I had to do it again, I would be a creative writer, write novels and so forth, but back then, that didn't seem available to me. I knew nothing of it, and the Harlem Renaissance was happening, but it wasn't happening in Oklahoma [City, Oklahoma], so I didn't really understand that creative writing can be such a powerful tool for our people. So I went into journalism, and, of course, it has boundaries and constraints. You are constrained by the truth. You are constrained by the facts that you can prove. So when I think of people like Janet Cooke, who made up a story for the Washington Post, I understand even though it was a terrible breach and insult to our community and a violation to all black journalists, and on, and on, but what I understand about that she should have been writing fiction all along. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: She's creative and that journalism--when I meet children now who say that they love to write, and they love to write poetry, and they like to make things up from whole cloth, I do not steer them towards journalism because making stuff up is the easiest way to get into big trouble as a journalist. Speaker 1: It's probably more enjoyable to create your own, perhaps? Speaker 2: For me, it's much more enjoyable to create my own, but what journalism has given me is enough amazing experiences so that now when I sit down to write creatively, I really have something to say, and something that I can show people. My whole philosophy about journalism, though, is that I really want to show people something they haven't seen, take people somewhere they haven't been, tell them something they haven't heard, and you can also do that with fiction successfully.

The women at the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District [of Greater Chicago], for example, talked about being sexually harassed, there were bomb threats. There were all kinds of issues with them when they spoke out with me, but change occurred somewhat. And there was education that occurred, and women tell me that their working conditions are there are better. We went undercover there to prove that this was going on, and that there was a hostile work environment. We went undercover at Ford Motor Company [in Chicago, Illinois] when the women there came to me to complain that they were being treated in a hostile way, and we found evidence of quite a hostile work environment.

Legally, the investigators, the police are looking and hoping that through DNA, after the baby is born, they will find the person who sexually assaulted this girl. She can't speak.

The women at the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District [of Greater Chicago], for example, talked about being sexually harassed, there were bomb threats. There were all kinds of issues with them when they spoke out with me, but change occurred somewhat. And there was education that occurred, and women tell me that their working conditions are there are better. We went undercover there to prove that this was going on, and that there was a hostile work environment. We went undercover at Ford Motor Company [in Chicago, Illinois] when the women there came to me to complain that they were being treated in a hostile way, and we found evidence of quite a hostile work environment. Lawsuits were filed. The women recovered money. You know, so again working conditions hopefully are better as a result of the work that we did. And I get thirty calls a day from people who have real, serious problems or from whistle-blowers who want to tell about issues that are going on, and want to tell about how government isn't doing what it is supposed to do, or how they are being defrauded by the private sector.

Speaker 2: Well, you know, basically when someone calls me, I check them out and there's not very much that I haven't heard of or seen and so I just know how to track things down very quickly, and I sometimes do not have any evidence. For example, the story that I just told you about happened at a place called the Alden Village Nursing Home in Bloomingdale, Illinois. Actually, three years ago, someone called me with a similar complaint of sexual abuse, but I couldn't prove it. It never was proven, so I put it in my files, and when I got this call this time, I went straight to that file and I said, ""Now, this is call is pregnant. That's real evidence."" So the story I wasn't able to do back then, now I can go and pick that up, and do it. In addition, I know how to gather the records from the Department of Public Aid, the Department of Public Health, and to find out what investigations have occurred from Medicare and Medicaid.

Speaker 1: -- because of-- Speaker 2: Because that's where the passion was, that's where the call was. Although the work I did was also passion. I think by '85 [1985]--oh, I know, between '81 [1981] and '85 [1985], I worked for the Child Abuse Prevention Program [sic., Child Assault Prevention Project]. Sally Cooper was the director, CAP, that's right, Child Abuse Prevention. And actually, I found the job in the Call and Post. They were looking for a part-time writer to develop a curriculum for special needs kids on child abuse prevention. And they hired me because my--you know, I have a undergraduate degree from Norfolk State [College, later, Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] in special ed [special education] and a master's from Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] in learning disabilities and behavioral disorders. So it looked like I was good. Speaker 1: But you were hired basically as a publicist for them, I mean to write content (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: No, I actually wrote the curriculum. Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so you wrote, okay. Speaker 2: Yeah, I actually wrote the curriculum. Speaker 1: So you wrote a curriculum, okay. Speaker 2: Right, and then we tested it out on special needs kids and, what's the word--refined it. And then I think it was used around the country for quite some time. But Sally Cooper was, is, still, an incredible women, but she was well, she was politically connected. And she was good friends with the governor's wife at that time. The governor was Richard Celeste, Democrat, and his wife, Dagmar Celeste, who was an incredible feminist. And so Sally was always doing stuff with Dagmar.

So, she was just early starting out. But one of the things that happened maybe that first four or five days, even if you couldn't speak each other's language--'cause there were like fifteen thousand women from around the world, I mean literally around the world. No matter where you were from, there were certain things about you being a woman that you could share with a woman from anywhere, from Bangladesh, from Sweden, from Canada, from a small village, from Ghana, I mean just everywhere, small island off the, off the coast of South America. No matter where you were from, it was like--it was like all the men of the world had gone some place, agreed how they were gonna treat women, and then went back home because no matter where this woman was from, we all had the same stories about childbirth. We all had the same menstruation stories. We had all the same horrible stories about how we were treated in every place. You know, women were raped in every place, they were beat up in every place; they, they, women talked about their stories of misogyny, they talked about their rights of passage stories that were awful, just--and then somehow this gloriousness of being a woman and finding your own voice, and your own sense of agency, and not wanting to lose that. It was, it was miraculous. I came back home, and I was, I was so fired up. And what I said to my friends is, ""When these--when I meet with these white women and we start talking about policy--"" because at that time in Columbus [Ohio], the white women were starting to galvanize around women's health issues. And I was right there at the table, sometimes one of maybe two black women or sometimes the only black woman. And so one of the things that I said was-- Story_ID: 174798 Speaker 1: Okay, you said in Columbus [Ohio] white women were organizing around health issues (simultaneous).

I, and I said, ""Just, you know, how to be, how to get rid of that inner garbage that gets in the way of limiting who you are, finding out that you really do have power to create the kind of world that you want, that you don't have to be a victim of anything""--'cause I, you know, when we talked earlier, I told you about all my victimizations. So it, that, that was scaring people, the fact that women were literally changing their own lens of how they saw themselves. That was scaring people more than anything, I think. Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: But there was nothing I could do about that, but it was scaring me. Story_ID: 174807 Speaker 1: Okay, so back to this incident where this little girl is beaten up by these two boys (simultaneous). Speaker 2: Yes, so I wrote an article in the Call and Post about the fact that I did not hear one black man say anything to these boys or to have a community discussion about their own outrage of what two boys would do to a girl who looked like them. And I was hot, and you could tell I was really angry in the article. And I had men stopping me everywhere. And a really good friend who said that he was coming to me on behalf of other men to tell me that I could not write angry articles. Now, my thing is if Amos Lynch didn't care and it was his newspaper that I didn't care what other men thought. And I told him, I said, ""I can't believe you're coming to me and saying this."" ""Well, Fran, you know that women really, you know, they follow you, and we can't be having no angry, black women in our city."" Can you believe that? So that's when I decided that I needed to have a national conference on awakened women.

And it was during the time--I had indicated as I said my interests in civil rights had continued during all of that time. So I had then--especially during my senior year, I had indicated an interest in participating in it with some of the students in addition to the constitution and law and all that. When Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] lawyers would come to Washington [D.C.] to argue cases before the [U.S.] Supreme Court there were a group of us that would come and argue their cases before or try it, try it out on us before they went (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So kind of sharpened themselves up.

I was invited to become active with the National Council on Aging and I became active with the National Council on Aging. And so therefore with that we would hold hearings and I became actually I was a former chairman of that. Then we invited, when we would hold hearings--when we would hold meetings we invited Clintons in and so therefore we still had that connection.

I, I did not--Margaret I think went in and gave testimony for him or something, but I didn't do that but I just did not oppose him. And so of course they knew that I didn't oppose him because I was asked to do a petition or something opposing him but I did not oppose him. So he was then confirmed there was, and whatever his first opinion was I got a call, I don't know who the black reporter was who called me and said, ""Well what do you think"" and I said, ""All I can say is I'm disappointed,"" and that's all, that's all I could say. (Laughter) So I have not--I haven't seen Thomas since that time and, and I just haven't, you know, but anyway-so I did not oppose him, I did not oppose him, because he convinced me that he was not against affirmative action and he showed me all this stuff.

Speaker 1: Harold Washington was elected here in Chicago in 1983. Did the atmosphere change any when Harold Washington was elected? Or did you see, did you notice any difference in-- Speaker 2: Not in terms of the crime rate or the police department. Because remember, the city of Chicago is one city within the County of Cook. And so, the State's Attorney represents the County of Cook. And so, you're talking about crime across... over a hundred municipalities. So, the State's Attorney was always very strict in terms of the way the State's Attorney's Office was laid out. Only the first chair in a courtroom--meaning the most senior State's Attorney in a courtroom--could determine the level of plea bargains in certain kinds of cases--crimes of violence, murder, rape, home invasion. That was when the law changed as well, to make it a Class X, so those crimes got greater penalties and no probation, which meant those cases had to be tried. So, that whole law and order mentality made for a more tense time, because you had cases that suddenly--where maybe you could have plea-bargained for something less than prison time--now automatically carried a prison sentence. So, unless the State's Attorney was willing to reduce the charge, you were going to be going to trial on these cases, because there was really no alternative. So, you didn't sense a change, in terms of the way the police or the State's Attorney dealt with crime. You simply saw under Harold Washington a greater awareness about how it was impacting minorities.

But I was on the inside saying this is how the criminal justice system can be made better and fairer. On the governor's Death Penalty Commission, I was there to say, this is what happens when poor people are represented in these death penalty cases. This is, these are the resources that are necessary. This is the way the case is being handled. You should not only look at it from the prosecutor's perspective. So, these are areas where I think my legacy will be--that the Public Defender's Office has stature, it has a voice, and it has greater respect than it's ever had. Story_ID: 179382 Speaker 1: Some of the things that you mentioned, I want to talk about. For the past, I guess, ten years in Cook County [Illinois], the prosecution--I mean the number of young black men and young Hispanic men that are going to prison have been astronomical. Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Speaker 1: It keeps accelerating. And the crimes that were once juvenile crimes are now--I mean the juvenile code is under constant attack, you know. It's almost like there's no juvenile court anymore to some, you know-- Speaker 2: Sure, sure. Speaker 1: There's no recognition that a juvenile is innocent--is not the same as an adult--when they commit a violent crime. Speaker 2: Exactly. And, and, but, you know, that's changing. Under the Juvenile Code, a child from technically ten years old to the age of sixteen--their cases will all be heard in Juvenile Court, whatever the offense. Then through a series of legislative changes, certain violent offenses were to be tried as adults automatically. Story_ID: 179383 Speaker 1: One of the problems that has come about in this country is we allowed a few people to dictate to the system how it would operate.

In my research I was struck by a couple of slave, ex-slave narratives, and I really do not remember, I really need to look this up. I don't remember if these were two separate narratives or the same narrative. I think there were two separate narratives. But one narrative--in one narrative the slave--ex-slave was talking about the devotional life of the slave--of the mistress of the plantation. And she noted that the mistress would, every day at a certain time, she would sit in the parlor and read the Bible, do her Bible reading, devotional reading for the day. And then there's another slave narrative, I think the second slave narrative that I read where the slave or ex-slave was talking about having been beaten, having been ordered beaten by the foreman because the mistress had ordered the foreman to beat the slave, because the mistress had just discovered that the master of the plantation had sexually abused--had raped the slave woman. I call it rape; the text may not have used for the word rape, but it referenced sexual relation with the slave woman. Speaker 1: Who was she? Speaker 2: I call it rape because if you don't got freedom then you don't have the freedom to say no, you know, so it's rape. Well I couldn't reconcile those two narratives. One narrative talking about a woman sitting--a mistress sitting in the parlor reading the Bible as her regular devotional life, and the other narrative talking about the mistress on the plantation ordering the woman to be beaten because she got angry and upset and I guess in her disempowered state, she couldn't do anything to her husband, so she wanted the slave woman beaten.

So that sent me to slave and ex-slave narratives to look at African American women's contributions in the area of defining African American women's reality and African American women's reality in our understanding of religion. In my research I was struck by a couple of slave, ex-slave narratives, and I really do not remember, I really need to look this up. I don't remember if these were two separate narratives or the same narrative. I think there were two separate narratives. But one narrative--in one narrative the slave--ex-slave was talking about the devotional life of the slave--of the mistress of the plantation. And she noted that the mistress would, every day at a certain time, she would sit in the parlor and read the Bible, do her Bible reading, devotional reading for the day. And then there's another slave narrative, I think the second slave narrative that I read where the slave or ex-slave was talking about having been beaten, having been ordered beaten by the foreman because the mistress had ordered the foreman to beat the slave, because the mistress had just discovered that the master of the plantation had sexually abused--had raped the slave woman. I call it rape; the text may not have used for the word rape, but it referenced sexual relation with the slave woman. Speaker 1: Who was she? Speaker 2: I call it rape because if you don't got freedom then you don't have the freedom to say no, you know, so it's rape. Well I couldn't reconcile those two narratives. One narrative talking about a woman sitting--a mistress sitting in the parlor reading the Bible as her regular devotional life, and the other narrative talking about the mistress on the plantation ordering the woman to be beaten because she got angry and upset and I guess in her disempowered state, she couldn't do anything to her husband, so she wanted the slave woman beaten. Story_ID: 187180 Speaker 1: And I kept asking myself, what was that woman reading in that Bible? What was that Bible telling her about what goes on outside that parlor that she was sitting--that parlor window that she was sitting in front of? What was that Bible telling her about how slave women, black are being treated on her plantation, even if this is a different (unclear), that's not the point.

Then he found out that I could keep secrets, and you see what he did? Gave me the Key to the City [Bradenton, Florida]. I didn't tell it, I wasn't gon' tell it.

If you were doing something on that street, if you were sitting in church and you did something wrong, all your mother had to do was to glance in your direction.

Now, now they would call that child abuse; they would call that beating people. That was not the case, because they didn't have to threaten you but once with that switch, and you knew that certain things were off limit. When you did that--we certain have a generation of people that grew up respecting other adults. And now, they don't do that.

Instead, they'll farm the child out to a suburban community, which makes reunification with the family almost impossible. Speaker 1: Okay.

Being the public relations director for them, to get people out of some of these projects and to get them out of these projects that are eight and ten floors high where girls are raped and can be pushed down elevators, we were the ones that decided that HUD [United States Department of Housing and Urban Development] would have to--if you're going to build a project now, it cannot be over two or three floors high.

She is a historian, actually a dean at North Carolina State [University in Raleigh, North Carolina] right now, so, as a historian she would push back against some of the kind of ahistorical, racial things I would say and so some of it was my identity, some of it was my friendship, some of it was what I was reading, but, you know, by the time five years of graduate school passed, I had a very, very different world view.

So it really, it was this kind of personal moment of changing my identity from, like pan-Africanist, nationalist, black girl, to pan-African nationalist black girl rape survivor, to ""Oh-wait a minute, that is going to have to change my whole analysis,"" and so by the time, and, I'm also by the way encountered Wahneema Lubiano, who made me read a whole bunch of other things and also just made me stop saying certain kinds of things and I met my very best girlfriend [Blair Kelley], who is the second half of my brain and she has never been anybody's nationalist nothing, and so she critiqued and she challenged. She is a historian, actually a dean at North Carolina State [University in Raleigh, North Carolina] right now, so, as a historian she would push back against some of the kind of ahistorical, racial things I would say and so some of it was my identity, some of it was my friendship, some of it was what I was reading, but, you know, by the time five years of graduate school passed, I had a very, very different world view.

Speaker 2: He was our neighbor, which is why I did not tell, so this was after we had moved and my mother had gone through a lot to buy the home, so this is the first time we lived in a single family home.

A nice little, you know, neighborhood, still two, my two best friends in high school [Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Virginia] lived in that same neighborhood.

End up in court and telling the judge who this person is to me, what he had done to me, and the judge, (unclear) judge says, ""well, I mean, I don't know anything about that, if there is any report of anything like that; this just sounds like neighbors and so go home and be nice to each other."" And, basically you know my mom's enjoyment of that neighborhood ended from the time that she knew, so she had enjoyed and loved her neighborhood, she is a gardener, she always loved to garden, but like her garden was the line of their property and so it really, so, part of the reason I never told was because sure enough, once I did and once that happened, it just made the whole experience for everyone there very, very ugly and awful, and it wasn't long after that, after the court thing happened, because even though the judge did nothing, his wife heard me say what I said and people who rape teenagers, grown men who do that, are not single-time perpetrators. It's never true, and I suspect that as the wife she also understood that he had probably perpetrated in other circumstances, whatever those were, because very shortly thereafter their marriage broke up and the family moved, but yeah, and again, I talk about being a survivor on air, but I have never had a conversation with my father about it.

And the U.S. attorney vehemently opposed this application--that mail fraud was a very serious crime, that people had to learn a lesson, and that he might flee because he didn't have real strong roots in the community. And so this just went on and on. So finally the judge, who had been listening to all this patiently, said--well, she had the young man come forward, she admonished him that he'd better show up if she let him out.

The violence, the brutality that had been inflicted, the beatings of the inmates. And we divvyed up the work. So the first lawsuit I ever filed on my own was a case involving conditions of confinement of four hundred inmates who, in the aftermath of Attica, given the destruction of the prison, had been transferred to Green Haven Prison [Green Haven Correctional Facility, Stormville, New York].

While working on prison and jail cases and inmates of Green Haven versus [John L.] Zelker was a real eye opener.

My lead plaintiff was a man, they had taken his artificial limb, thrown it into a bonfire, I mean, they were just being cruel and harassing. And I did win that case. But meanwhile, the Sostre case is going forward on another track [United States ex rel. Sostre v. Festa, 1975]. And I don't really have any relationship with it, but I'm interested in it. So I volunteered to work on that case with a man named Herman Schwartz and Paul [G.] Chevigny. And the upshot of it was that there was a hearing held in Buffalo, New York, before a federal judge, on whether or not this inmate, who is now recanting his testimony, was telling the truth such that Sostre should be retried. And I participated in that hearing. And it was really a tragic thing because this brother got up, and he testified what he had done, and why he had done it and he was an addict at the time. And the judge ruled that he didn't know whether the inmate was telling the truth the first time or the second time, and therefore he couldn't say that Sostre was in prison wrongly, and therefore he could not be released.

And the classification system by type of crime, violent, those kinds of characteristics. The Georgia State Prison had a policy of placing the young inmates, the first offenders, in with the homosexuals, because they said they didn't fight as hard as the older prisoners, and it was a way of pacifying the population. So I got, this is outrageous, I got a letter one time, an anonymous letter from someone who said there was a young inmate who had been viciously gang raped in the dormitory and that this inmate was writing to say couldn't we help to try to get this kid out. So I called for the--an opportunity to meet this young man, and he came out, and he was not as big as I am, he looked like he didn't shave yet, little young, in for car theft, first offender. He was obviously, mentally, completely out of it. I mean he couldn't, he was having hallucinations because every time I talked to him he was doing this, looking around, he was hearing voices.

That's not normal behavior for a ten or eleven-year-old girl, and thought nothing of it. This child was raised in this very middle class, protected household. By the time she was twelve or thirteen, she was thinking of killing herself. She was having suicidal ideation and, at some point, had attempted to stab a teacher. She began to attack her mother. She began to engage in behaviors that were dangerous and risky. So, there was an unfolding and unraveling over the years of symptoms we associate with bipolar disorder. She was not diagnosed until she was around fifteen or so, and even then she was on her way to jail because of some infraction that she had incurred at school and when someone thought, well wait a minute, maybe we need to have a doctor see her. Maybe this is a mental problem and not a ""bad kid"" problem, and she was diagnosed on a psychiatric inpatient unit as bipolar, and from that point forward, she was treated with complexities and varieties of treatments that exist for bipolar illness that include some medication; however, again because of our gene makeup, we are more responsive to some medicines than to others so she's twenty-one now and has just had a medication combination that seems to be maintaining her over some time, so that she was able to finish high school. She is now able to work, I think, twenty-three hours a week. She has dropped her use of drugs.

The minority always follows the majority eventually. You know, the incidents of women incarcerated has been skyrocketing in the last ten years. There used to be very few women in jail. That is changing dramatically. Many more women now are being arrested for felony-level offenses and the same theme, I think, in any other kind of behavior. We sometimes think that behaviors are restricted to one or the other group. That's a huge fallacy. It's mythology. Speaker 1: So, you're saying that as women become more like men, they get in trouble more, or is that-- Speaker 2: Well, somehow, again it's a complex, it's a complexity of human nature, I think. Somehow gaining parity also means gaining the ability to engage in the vicissitudes of the majority. Lung cancer used to be way more common in men, because only men smoked, but once women got the right [social permission] to smoke, now we're seeing more and more and more and more lung cancer among women, you know. In terms of the inmate situation, women incarcerated has typically been associated with sexual abuse of these women in early life. Now, does it mean that more women are being sexually abused? I'm not sure, exactly. Are more women being abused in general? Again, I'm not quite sure about that, but there has certainly been a surge. It used to be when I talked to a teenager about selling drugs it was always a guy; not so any more. There are more and more women; girls are out here selling drugs, okay? The social order shifts, I think, for a lot of reasons; you know, racially, socioeconomically, gender-wise, there is a lot of reason for this transition and this flow that's way beyond our discussion today.

And then MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] had an undergraduate research kind of program. They hadn't formalized it as such, but you could take, you could work in the lab and get paid in the summer, which is what I did or work for academic credit during the academic year.

So that was what I did the summer after my freshman year. Story_ID: 29431 Speaker 1: The summer after my sophomore year, I thought well, gee, I hadn't gone home.

And they offered me a job at their facility outside of Baltimore [Maryland]. And so I took that job. I only worked there for, I don't know, maybe three weeks, a month because there was a supervisor there who kept harassing me about what I was doing and so on. And I never got the job that I wanted to work in a lab, and I had worked in a lab at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. And by that time, I had finished two years at MIT. And there were two other, two guys who were at MIT with me who also had scholarships, and they got jobs in labs. And so because of some things that happened, I quit. Now, my parents [George Hiter Jackson and Beatrice Cosby Jackson] were pretty upset because they thought I might lose my scholarship, but here I was driving all the way from D.C., past Baltimore to go to work, and it wasn't fun.

And there was a lot of concern about nuclear programs in the former states, the former Soviet states, both in terms of securing material and the safety of the nuclear operations and the attempts to shut down certain types of reactors, so called RBMK's which are the type, is the type of reactor that blew up in the, that had, it was a steam explosion in Chernobyl [Chernobyl disaster, 1986]. And then there were issues domestically related to nuclear waste, you know, what, how would one deal with spent nuclear fuel. There were issues related to the possible license extension, called license renewal of existing nuclear power plants. There were issues of design certification, final design approval and design certification of new reactor designs. And then I, there was some problems in a particular plant in Connecticut called Millstone [Nuclear Power Plant, Waterford, Connecticut], having to do with some safety issues with respect to offloading fuel when they went to refuel the reactor. And it unveiled a number of problems across the board, and there were some issues of harassment and intimidation of employees. So I ended up actually having the plant, we had the plant shut down for two, two and a half years. But then that opened up a whole Pandora's box about what was called the design basis documentation, meaning, you know, the plant is designed. There is documentation of that design, but then if there are ever changes made to the plant, you know, physical changes, things redesigned or new parts put in, one had to think about what that did to the overall design and safety envelope of the plant and it needed to be well documented. And so there were some questions that arose as a consequence of the Millstone situation, that, where I then pushed to have the whole industry focus on the whole design basis documentation issue. It was not happily received in the nuclear industry. Speaker 1: Now, why is that?

I did have to walk three miles to school [Woodville Elementary School, Richmond, Virginia] and, and to church [Mount Tabor Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia] and I did it when I was six and seven and eight years old; which was unfortunate, because at eight years old I was molested once when I was coming from school, walking alone. But there was no transportation, you know, to, we had no school buses and the city buses didn't run so the only way you got to school was to walk.

Story_ID: 521626 Speaker 1: The other part is this resilience. So that's sort of one piece that I really care about. But another piece is resilience as a whole. And so the next book that we have coming out is called 'Micro-Resilience' ['Micro-Resilience: Minor Shifts for Major Boosts in Focus, Drive, and Energy,' Bonnie St. John and Allen P. Haines]. And Allen [Allen P. Haines] is co-authoring it with me. He's actually gonna get his name on the cover this time. Not just to do all the work, but actually get his name on the cover. And it's taking many of the things I learned, coping with healing from sexual abuse, staying motivated, being an athlete. There's a lot of science, there's a lot of things that I read along the way about that. We went back and scoured the literature, the current literature, and found even more things. And micro-resilience is a set of tools. There is five frameworks and twenty-one tools that give you minor shifts you can make in your life each day that give you big boosts in energy and focus, and drive. So it's, this is the culmination of my work in many ways. Is to take the things I've learned, turn it into easy tools, and give it to people so that everybody can have more resilience. Wherever you're starting, everybody can have more resilience. And so our vision is really to take that book out, that teaching. And we've been teaching that in corporations for years, but really packaging it as a book and taking it out. We really want to create a community of people who are teaching these methods and sharing these methods and pulling other people along. Because ultimately, what I realized it's about, as I went through writing the book and really digging into the science behind each of these...",sexual abuse,,,1/1/2000,,,USA,N,,yes,"John, Bonnie HM0",,,,,,,,,,Black or African American,,,

So he has a lot of stories about that and the people trying to, there were cattlemen who didn't want the homesteaders out there so there were these kind of conflicts between the, not exactly violence but they would cut the barbed wire fence to let their cattle come in and graze on the homesteaders land and my grandfather had a dog that would, you know, attack the cattle. So (laughter) there was all this stuff going on but I think it was, it was a pretty unusual and it was kind of like what a boy's dream, I guess, growing up like that, you know. Speaker 2: My heavens.

He had too much sense for that. So a couple of times he got accused and the union was able to deal with it you know, and it didn't affect him. He was able to move on.

So my father's experience I think shaped me in that 'cause he would come home and the union had to go to bat and blah, blah, blah, blah.

I said, ""Ms. Phillips, how did you come to the Legal Defense Fund?"" See, I was selected, I was a new lawyer on the staff, selected to meet actually the client. And she looked at me, she said ""Oh,"" she said, ""this was civil rights issues and I knew Negroes understood civil rights and so--and I knew this was a Negra organization."" We're all at dinner, some restaurant in New York. All at--and, ""I knew this is a Negra organization and I came here."" Now she said Negra twice, and I sat back and everybody else, and I sat back and I said to myself, ""See that's why you have to think."" I said, ""We're here celebrating a victory for Ms. Phillips. Ms. Phillips is tickled, she's happy, she's pleased."" I said, ""The last thing she wants to do is insult us. She doesn't want to insult us."" So when people say things, you don't just take it at face value, you have to think about it in context. I said, ""So now why is she saying this?"" She's saying this because where she's from in Georgia, they use the lazy a, it slurs off their tongues, Negra. It's not Negro 'cause then it was Neg- wasn't black, wasn't African American, it was Negro, so Negra, you see. So I--when that--it didn't take long for that to drop and then I leaned forward. And I said, ""Now Ms. Phillips,"" I said ""Negra is an insult to black people."" She said ""Oh."" I said, ""Yes."" I said--I played that southern card again. I said, ""I'm from the South like you, and I've heard--now practice with me, watch it, 'Negro, Negro.'"" I said, ""Take your time and say, Negro."" So she leaned forward. She said, ""Negro."" So we were practicing Negro. And so Negro is what--I said, ""Think of knee and think of grow,"" and I said, ""just say the two words, Negro,"" and she practiced. But you see you could--I could--we all could have gotten insulted, dinner, blow up in a huff 'cause she insulted, blah, blah, blah, blah you know, but that's where the Peace Corps experience taught me different cultures, different backgrounds, take time to think where a person is coming from, and to try to listen to their meaning, 'cause many times they do not mean to insult. They do not mean to insult. That's why again, diversity is so important you know. Joe Biden talking about clean. Clean! I mean he didn't mean to insult, you know. So that's an important lesson.

So, I wasn't very comfortable, in that environment, so I requested to go do all of my time, full-time, with the children, and it was during that time, I was counseling with children who had been sent to the state hospital, and we would go to court with them, as a social work intern.

Speaker 2: Well, I don't know about remarkable. But while I was there in the District Attorney's office, I prosecuted a man; I somehow or another ended up developing a specialty in sex offenses. Usually the victims were kids, and, so I prosecuted a whole lot of, incest cases, and child abuse neglect, that were, had many aspects of sexual abuse involved with them. And the largest verdict at that time in that county, I received, in a case where a man received approximately 233 years in prison, as a result of the case, so I vividly remember that case. There were several others, but that one was by far, because the verdict was so big, that, one that stands out in my mind. Another one was a young man, who, couldn't seem to stay out of trouble, and I'd prosecuted him, he would go, and he would come back, and he'd get out, and revolving door, and finally he went to prison. I think the last time he got like twenty years, and then he went to prison and started writing me these love letters, about how how he really loved me, and that was why he was committing all these crimes, so he could come back and see me.

Story_ID: 65300 Speaker 1: And I was also experiencing some difficulties, as an attorney in juvenile court here in Wichita [Kansas], because juvenile court is the bottom of the rung, or it was, at that time. And I'm sure not a whole lot has changed here in Wichita since then. But it was on a rotation basis, the judges would come to juvenile court, rotate out there, for a year, and then rotate out and go back downtown to the court house and do other civil or criminal work. So it was a very unpopular court, it was a very difficult court, you know you dealt with those emotional issues of families and child abuse, and neglect, and things of that nature, termination of parental rights. So, it wasn't an easy court to be in, and I really felt like you needed judges who wanted to be in that kind of environment, and so I was tired of the flip flop with the judges, because, at that time the focus was work with family until you can put them back together. And it may take three or four years, to undo generations of dysfunction, or substance abuse, or whatever the issue was. So, we would have one judge on a case for a year, and that judge would make all the rulings and the case would move in this direction, and then at the end of that year, that judge would leave, we'd get a new judge, and we would start cases all over again. And families were not going anywhere, and the system was really, bogged down in my opinion.

Story_ID: 638665 Speaker 1: I'd like to go back and talk about--just get a little more clarification and your thoughts on a couple of things that we talked about earlier, and one was King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]. Can you give me more insight into your analysis of, of what you said about King? Speaker 2: Martin Luther King came along during the Eisenhower [President Dwight David ""Ike"" Eisenhower] years. And the nation was, was fairly conservative at that time. The nation was also unaware that there was a great deal of anger. Because when the veterans came back from World War II [WWII], the black veterans and perhaps this is true also of, of Hispanic, but the veterans when they came back were thrown back in--into the same economic situation that they left. They had risked their lives for their country, but there were no new jobs opening up for them, no new income levels opening up for them. And so they felt raped. They felt that their lives had been risked and, and the country did not appreciate them very much, so there was a good deal of, of anger, there was a climate of anger in the late '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s]. Then when Emmett Till was killed that simply led, led to the explosion. Now Martin King came into--came into the mix almost accidentally. This woman, Rosa Parks, sat in in Montgomery, Alabama. King was from Atlanta, Georgia but he'd just been called to a church in, in Montgomery to, to the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church [Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church] in Montgomery. It was in Montgomery's inner city close to downtown, and, and Rosa Parks got on this bus close to downtown. She had literally been, been programmed to be put on the bus by the--by the Montgomery NAACP [Metro Montgomery Branch of the NAACP, Montgomery, Alabama]. So just as soon as, as she was arrested, then--then--then the NAACP was mobilized to start a movement. And they would boycott the buses in Montgomery.

My mother [Velma Lawson] was a--my mother was a very kind hearted person and that from her, she was the neighborhood, informally the neighborhood social worker, psychologist and so from her front porch she helped young people in need. She would you know, had an open door for somebody who needed help. For example, there was a young woman who--we had sadly a Catholic priest who was molesting kids and molesting young women. And this young girl came to my mother and talked to her about the fact that she was sure that she was pregnant. And thought that the priest was the father and that she was in a panic because she just felt that that was something she couldn't tell her family.

When those slaves were captured in what's today present day Ghana and were taken across the Atlantic and were taken to Jamaica in order to be broken in, the word they used was seasoned; they would season them. The slave owners would break their spirits and teach them how to be subservient or that was the goal, submissive. It didn't work so well in Jamaica. The Ashanti are actually the group that is the majority of the Jamaican population; more than 90% of Jamaicans are of Ocond or Ashanti descent. So you have a built in culture of warrior mentality; going to fight back. I am independent; you can't tell me what to do, which in many ways has played out even today in Jamaica. Now some of those Ocond warriors escaped and they escaped to the mountains and hills in Jamaica in a parish that today is Trelawny Parish. It's towards the interior of the island.

By now my grandfather had moved from St. Ann's Bay which is where he was born to Kingston which became the capitol of Jamaica. My grandfather at the age of around thirty was married to a woman her name was Mae [Williams]. They were not able to have children and my grandfather was at that point reasonably prosperous for a black Jamaican and Mae it turns out that it was Mae who could not have children because when my grandmother, Sarah [Lloyd] who was thirteen was sent from the country to work in their household, Sarah became pregnant by Jack. I am sure the scandal was significant although I will say in that era thirteen year olds were getting married, having babies all the above. But still scandalous, this is--I don't, I'm sure they were not first cousins, they probably were like third or fourth cousins but it's still unseemly and in today's world it certainly would have been statutory rape. So my father was born to Jack Williams and Sarah Lloyd who when he was born she was fourteen years old. I found my father's birth certificate, in fact, there are two birth certificates. The first birth certificate that reflects his original date of birth indicates that Mae was present at his birth. I went to the address where that's listed on my father's birth certificate at 9 Hannah Street in Hannah Town, Kingston [Jamaica] and we believe that's where the midwife was. My grandmother, of course, was sent out of that house when she was pregnant and she probably lived with relatives in Kingston until the baby--my father was born. When he was born Mae took possession of him. Story_ID: 54515 Speaker 1: My father [Elrick Williams] did not grow up with his mother. Mae [Williams], the stepmother, took possession of Elrick and she took him home to Jack [Williams] and they raised Elrick as their son.

My other brother--my oldest brother is worse. My middle brother Howard is a charmer, he likes to be liked. He likes to be social, he likes to be around people, he likes--and what we now concluded is that when he was a kid, he must have had ADD [Attention Deficit Disorder] and he learned differently than we learned which led to what the nuns refer to as him being lazy and he wasn't lazy at all. But ultimately a certain amount of harassment by the teachers went on towards him. And when I was a little kid growing up like that with three of us being three different shades of brown going from yellow to chocolate and our mother [Nell Williams] looking the way she did and our father [Elrick Williams] looking the way he did and growing up in Harlem [New York City] and nuns who were overwhelmingly Irish--white Irish and I was very aware of race and color at an early age. I've always looked at it and studied it and been fascinated. And I interpreted the treatment of my older brother Howard because I'd heard some of the teachers and nuns, when they were speaking to him in a reprimanding tone they would refer to his color. And I concluded that he had a harder time than all three of us because he was the dark brown skinned one of us. Although he was the most charming, I don't care.

There's one of a family member, I don't remember his name, who was a slave who would constantly or consistently I should say, consistently try to run away from plantation, and did have, was blinded so that he would not be able to run away again. We do have that story, but he was not going to stop trying to get his freedom. He had to be stopped physically be stopped. His spirit was not going to be broken. So, that's a story that circulates and pops up around the family from time to time. There's stories about Mamoo [Malveaux's great-grandmother, Attie McElroy (ph.)]. Those are probably the stories we've heard more of, that's our great-grandmother. Mamoo was very fair complected [ph.], had a very fair complexion and even fairer than I. Right now I have a summer tan, but she, she and my great-grandfather often times in order to make sure that they weren't harassed on the streets when they were driving through either late at night or whatever by hostile whites, Mamoo would get in the back seat of the car that Papoo [ph.] drove for the white family. I don't remember their name. My mom knows their names. And, and he would pretend that he was driving this white lady, like 'Driving Miss Daisy,' where they needed to go so that they wouldn't be harassed. So, that was one that we often would hear about how the fair complexion helped Mamoo and Papoo get out of dangerous, potentially dangerous situations at a time when there was quite a bit of danger about, for African Americans time when lynchings were happening on a regular basis the way in which they grew and lived.

But because she was a heroin addict, she hadn't naturally delivered. So, I was with this doctor, Dr. Lawer was his name. And we came in together with our scrubs, and I was just his little assistant. And she was there, and she was very angry, very upset. I think she might have still been high, and she was cursing at him because she was one of the only white people in the hospital because D.C. General mostly is predominantly black. So she was cursing at him, accusing him of, you know, undermining what was going on, you know, her baby and all that stuff. So it was really strange and disturbing to see. There was another young, young woman, a teenager. It was like her second or third child. Nobody was there with her. Nothing was happening on time, so she didn't have time for any medications. So she's screaming and crying and everything is just very traumatic. Another woman who came in had been raped. And so it was all these different types of deliveries and experiences within that weekend. And it did not discourage me at all. I loved it even more. I mean, I was not deterred by seeing all of that. It was pretty gross and disturbing, but I still was on that path. At the same time I also loved storytelling, drawing. I loved the visual as opposed to the print.

You know, you've got a woman with three kids; two boys and a daughter, a girl who's one and a half or two years old. It was really an interesting adventure because this was in--part of another wave of migration I guess out West from people from the South. So there were a lot of other people on the train and there was a lot of other kids on the train. So we actually had all these kids you can kind of hang out with. And we met a bunch of kids who we'd stay up late at night telling jokes with and stuff while we were on the train. And then there were kids who would tell you these stories about, ""Well, when you go to Texas--when you go through Texas in the middle of the night there were these giant lizards out there.

What other dreams and aspirations did you have as an elementary school student? Speaker 2: When you talk about that, it makes me think about something I wanted to do. They started talking about air raid shelters when I was a little girl in grammar school and where would people go. When you see on TV people talking about, ""Oh well I'm gonna build an air raid shelter and we're gonna put food there so that if we have a, a bomb or what have you or nuclear attack or something I'll have some place to take my family."" I said, ""Well where are we gonna go?"" You know there's no place in the projects for people in the projects to go? And I said, ""Okay well there's that incinerator room."" I think I even went to the management office [at Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois] at about ten or eleven years old and talked to the people there about the possibility of them taking those incinerator rooms and cleaning them out enough, not where the garbage, but the area around that and putting supplies down there so the people in the projects will have some place to go in the case of a nuclear attack. It never happened. But that was my first commitment to wanting to do something for my community. Speaker 1: What was the purpose, the original purpose of the incinerator rooms?

It doesn't sound like it came from a CPS [child protective services] worker. I said well you know what?

Share with us some of the things you are doing and some of the issues involved. Speaker 2: Well, right now I'm writing training for case managers and child protective services, and I was recently assigned to write the family violence training. So it's come full circle because I understand the relationship between family violence and child abuse. Recently there was legislation passed in Georgia, as well as other states, that said if a child witnesses family violence, that's a form of child abuse. And it is because it psychologically damages that child. Well there needs to be made that connection to where people understand that when you help a woman whose being abused, you are helping her children. Speaker 1: Yes. Speaker 2: And in many states most child protective services organizations have joined forces with the coalitions in that state against domestic violence. We've not done that in Georgia yet, and I'd like to see that collaboration and I'm working with our family violence unit for the state and the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence [GCADV] to hopefully make that collaboration before I leave this position.

So the shelters include them in their statistics. The domestic violence programs include them in their statistics because they intend to use those services, whereas people who are wealthier, don't have to go into a shelter. They can go off to a resort until the bad guys go away; tell the doctor to give them some Valiums so they can help deal with the situation.

But when a plane goes down because someone's aboard, that's a kind of a terrorist attack that we know about, and so I felt that our response was ill-advised. I thought so at the time.

There's a wonderful story about my grandfather that my great-grandmother used to take in wash and, and that's how she supported herself in addition to these medical things that she did which--for which I'm sure she didn't get paid very much, and that my grandfather, as the youngest child, used to deliver this laundry for her, and that there was some white woman up in the hills to whom he delivered the laundry on a regular basis, and the woman sent the message to my great-grandmother that she was interested in my grandfather, and that my grandmother would have to--my great-grandmother would have to agree to that, or she would accuse him of rape, so she would have him one way or the other, and the story is that they then shipped my grandfather out of Rural Retreat, out of a situation that was threatening to be very dangerous. Now, I never discussed that with my grandfather; I heard it said about him by many family members on the Richardson family, and there's a lot of history written about the Richardsons by the way--the county has done--there's a, there's a history project in Virginia where the Richardsons are--that their family history has been traced; there were a lot of them (laughter).

So we're having these conversations with these guys but they had--you know, he was a, a white man, an older man, you know, clearly from the North; they were not liking him very much. For some reason, once they hemmed us in on three sides, our leaders told us to disperse because they could see the situation was dangerous. There we were hemmed in in a white neighborhood. And when we tried to disperse, somebody called for the troopers to attack, and they came on these horses. And the thing that I remember that was most difficult was these big horses 'cause I was afraid that a horse was going to rear up and come down on my head; I mean they were huge beasts charging into a crowd. As soon as the cops started coming toward us, the same one that Galway had been talking to took a night stick and tried to gouge his eye out; they just came at him like that. Speaker 2: Just poked him right in his eye? Speaker 1: Yeah, and they missed--they missed his eye and hit his cheek and his cheek split open.

And I didn't want to spend the night because they had rats, or they had lice in the bed. So, certainly, where I lived was much better than where they were living. In terms of how other black people were living in the city, I had no clue as to where they were living or what their neighborhoods were like, because everyone I knew lived in a housing project. What I did know for sure is that, you know, I didn't like the violence. You know, I didn't like the fact that you had to protect yourself so much, and you had to be tough. And I didn't like the fact that there was so much sexual abuse and things like that, simply because, you know, people were vulnerable. I knew at an early age, I didn't like that. I knew at twelve and thirteen and fourteen, and certainly going into the teen years, that this is something that I would not want to bring my child--an environment that I would not want to bring my child up in. Now, on the other side of that, did my parents [Carrie Williams Duncan and Joseph Duncan] do their best to make sure that we were taken of? They certainly did. You know, we had Christmas and we had holidays, and we had, you know, the nicest things they could buy. We had full meals. We went to the parks, and we went to the lakefront, and we went to Riverview [Riverview Amusement Park, Chicago, Illinois] when it was open.

With--but if you refocus and you say you know the amount of money that we're spending on prisons, that we're spending on protection, and police protection, if we put a third of that into creating a topnotch educational system, we wouldn't have to export, excuse me, we wouldn't have to import the majority of our scientists. We wouldn't have to import so many people who do the technical things, because our, our educational system is so broken that the majority of people just wanna use a product. They don't know--they don't want to build a product. They don't want to invent a product. So, we've gone from being inventors to be consumers, because we have forgotten that education shouldn't be a privilege it should be a right, and we don't put that money into it and then the black community is impacted even more. When it comes to the churches, I don't see where most of the pastors are doing any more than some of these businesspeople are doing, which is basically raping and pillaging, making as much money as possible and leaving dodge with the money, meaning not living in the communities that they're servicing. And when you don't live in the community that you're servicing, then you don't feel the need to put back in to that community.

A region because of this dense, thick, dense rain forest and was exploited by King Leopold [Leopold II of Belgium] in the most atrocious kind of way, you know, the kind of atrocities that he, he committed there. But out of that, you have this legacy of repression that's continues to perpetuate itself. And even now you have a war that's going on that has claimed 3 million people since 1997 and yet receives relatively little coverage. But the real victims of this war are the women and children who were pretty much helpless and who didn't start this war, who don't fight the war but find themselves bearing the brunt of it. And one of the things that I went to look at in the Congo are the kind of gender specific human rights abuses that women suffer. And what we're seeing is that rape has become one of the primary tools of war used against both men and women but because rape is a tool, a tool of war, there are certain kind of medical problems that arise, a lot of the women end up gang raped and being ""ruined,"" which is going to be the title of my play. And once they're ruined, they're driven out from their villages and they're forced to wander. So now you have this class of women who are homeless.

Yeah, I mean the--you think about the history of the Congo and, and it's one it began as a geographically isolated country or if you can call it a country. A region because of this dense, thick, dense rain forest and was exploited by King Leopold [Leopold II of Belgium] in the most atrocious kind of way, you know, the kind of atrocities that he, he committed there. But out of that, you have this legacy of repression that's continues to perpetuate itself. And even now you have a war that's going on that has claimed 3 million people since 1997 and yet receives relatively little coverage. But the real victims of this war are the women and children who were pretty much helpless and who didn't start this war, who don't fight the war but find themselves bearing the brunt of it. And one of the things that I went to look at in the Congo are the kind of gender specific human rights abuses that women suffer. And what we're seeing is that rape has become one of the primary tools of war used against both men and women but because rape is a tool, a tool of war, there are certain kind of medical problems that arise, a lot of the women end up gang raped and being ""ruined,"" which is going to be the title of my play. And once they're ruined, they're driven out from their villages and they're forced to wander. So now you have this class of women who are homeless. And, and because you have these wandering women you lose a generation of mothers who are not raising sons, those sons get sucked back into the war so the cycle continues. And so I, I've been spending (laughter) a lot of time contemplating this and trying to figure out a way of dramatizing it but I don't wanna dramatize it in the typical way, in which you, you its documentary style in which these women become talking heads.

Speaker 1: Okay. Did you have any particular mentors or teachers that really were special to you when--during that grad period? Speaker 2: Not really, unh-uh, no. Story_ID: 481855 Speaker 1: When you got your degree [from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I mean, did you--did you go immediately back to Columbia [South Carolina] or did you-- Speaker 2: Unh-uh. I had a job when I got out of school here working for the department--it was then called the Department of Public Welfare [Wisconsin Department of Public Welfare; Wisconsin Department of Health Services], and I was hired before I graduated. So I had a job and it made sense to stay here since I had a job. And that's when I met--my first day at work, I met Lydia Brown [ph.] and I came in to work the same day together, and we were hired to investigate child abuse. Speaker 1: Okay. Now-- Speaker 2: We were child abuse investigators. Speaker 1: Lydia Brown, she was at one time a coordinator of the Midwest African American Theatre Alliance [sic.] and did a lot of cultural things and-- Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: --now living in Chicago [Illinois]. Speaker 2: Lives in Chicago, uh-huh. Speaker 1: But, so you all started the same day, that right? Speaker 2: Um-hm, yep. We were friends, have been friends since. Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Speaker 2: And the investigating child abuse was very--I never really knew about child abuse or about, you know, how children were hurt and killed as a result of abuse and neglect, so that was a rude awakening to me. And one of my first experiences was because we would go all over the city. We would get a complaint and, you know, if it landed with you, you had to go out to the home to investigate. And I remember Lydia and I going into a trailer park on the South Side of Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and this was going to obviously be a white family. And I remember the woman opening the door and saying, ""I'm not letting any jungle bunnies in my house. What are you all doing here?"" (Laughter) I looked at Lydia, I said, ""What's a jungle bunny?"" (Laughter) 'Cause I had never heard that before. She said I'll--she said, ""I'll tell you when we get in the car, but I'm not going in there either."" So, we were clear with our supervisors that we did not want to go into the white community to try to investigate child abuse, you know. Speaker 1: Because another issue pops up.

Speaker 1: And was kind of disgusted with how some things worked out. Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Milwaukee is tough. It was--I mean, just the way the city is divided by housing. It's only been in the last I think ten or fifteen years where black people have started going to the South Side [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] to live because it was just like--I don't even know the streets over there. I don't go over there. You know, you don't cross the viaduct. That was just the way it was. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 2: That was my first job, was investigating child abuse, yeah, and mostly in the central city and the North Side. But, again, that was a very rude awakening to me of poverty, very different than in the South, I think. The things that I saw, I had never seen before. Speaker 1: Like what, for instance? Speaker 2: The level of poverty, how people lived, homes where there was no food, where, you know, people were living in actual squalor and kids were neglected, didn't have food to eat, you know. I--there are poor people in the South, but I never saw that level of poverty and mistreatment of children before, so that was a rude awakening to me of kind of a difference. And I was thinking, some friends and I were talking about growing up. In the South, everybody lived in a house and had a yard--a yard. People didn't live in high-rise apartments or--the projects were one level, you know, maybe three or four units joined together. But, I think the difference was people were more independent but connected.

And that was really kind of the motivation for starting the agency [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin]. Speaker 1: Now, what was your analysis of I guess the child abuse problem? Speaker 2: Yeah, it was before crack cocaine, so it was some drugs, but not real prevalent. It was poverty and it was frustration, not having--people were most often referred for child neglect, children who came to school with, you know, very dirty clothes or who--the abuse was I would say maybe 20 percent of the time, but neglect because of poverty was more prevalent. Story_ID: 481858 Speaker 1: So how many years did you deal with the child abuse issue? Speaker 2: I did that for two years and then went into management after that, into-- Speaker 1: Now, how do you deal with the depression of that? I mean, it seemed like that to see a lot of that first hand would just-- Speaker 2: Well, the--what we would try to do for--when it related to poverty was to get the resources in, to get clothes and food. And when there was abuse, we had to take some children away from their parents. You know, you can't have this child because you have hurt him. And put children in foster care or receiving homes. Those are decisions that had to be made. And it was always whatever you need to do in the best interest of the child. That was the driving principle. This child is vulnerable, and you have to make your decision in the best interest of the child. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: That was it. Speaker 1: So, you, you went into administration around--this was about 1973, I guess? Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: Into my--you, you can't do the child abuse thing too long in my opinion. Two years was enough. And people would come in and out of there every two or three years 'cause you can't do that forever. So, I went into quality assurance for contracts that the department [Wisconsin Department of Public Welfare; Wisconsin Department of Health Services] had and then I went into family counseling, and then left to start New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] in 1975. Story_ID: 481859 Speaker 1: What prompted the beginning of New Concept [New Concept Self Development Center, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well-- Speaker 1: This is New Concept Self Development Center. Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: Part of it was some of the things that I realized that were happening with the child abuse was parents who were beating their children to punish them and--out of frustration and they didn't know how to parent their children. Now, I got whippings when I was growing up with a little switch, you know, on my legs, but I never got a beating. But, people were beating their children with extension cords, and it was out of frustration. So, there was an opportunity to start--also as a mental health, part of my social work training was in mental health. That was my secondary major [at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], so I was a licensed therapist as well as community organizer. So, you could get Title XIX [Title XIX of the Social Security Act] reimbursement during that time. It had just started that social workers could be reimbursed for providing counseling to families who were on medical assistance with Title XIX. So, you could set up a private practice, and anybody who had Title XIX on medical assistance, you could provide counseling to them.

I think that the hospital looked at my [maternal] grandmother [Loula Lewis] and that wasn't the time when men would go in for the birth, so they didn't see the husband [Presley Lewis] and grandmother looked white to them, and so they would just given them a white birth certificate. My mother [Mildred Lewis Pindell] didn't change it until she was in her sixties because she was going to retire and she wouldn't of been able to get her social security if she had a passport that said she was black and you know the records didn't correspond, so before my grandmother died, she had to go to court to testify that her daughter was black. So it's kind of complicated, but my mother was, I think my mother put up with a lot of taunting and harassment when she was in school, so she you know just had a lot of turmoil and it led to turmoil within the family when they would just do simple things like go to the movies, and the whites would sit downstairs and the blacks would sit upstairs. Part of the family would sit downstairs, the part that could pass and the other part of the family would sit upstairs. So I mean there was a lot of bitterness, you know about that. In fact one of the relatives by marriage, Coremenia [Coremenia Lewis], the one that's the oldest now, she's ninety-five, married a man, I can't remember what his name was, I think maybe she had two husbands, but he committed suicide in the arms of his daughter because he couldn't pass. He was light skinned but he had very crinkly hair and his daughter, that you know he died in her arms, she was blonde and blue-eyed, and she eventually passed.

And I, I won't give his name, but I do remember having--when I went to him about reconfirming that because I, you know, that, that's what Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] said.

There was clear pressure presented in, in both his physical conduct and his verbal statements that there was--this was a quid pro quo.

I just think that there was, there wasn't the respect for women in this profession. There wasn't--no one took women seriously. And there was a view that why should I waste a limited opportunity to get people placed, African Americans placed? Why would I waste that on, you know, these women? And so, I think they thought they had a very reasoned position of the notion, the notion of sexual harassment. And I don't even think they thought it was, was that.

And they had said a plane--and I could only hear a little bit, 'cause it wasn't very loud--and they said a plane had flown into one of the towers. Well I was thinking about the story of that Russian [sic, German] kid, Mathias Rust, who was in a little plane, and he flew into a building in Moscow [Russia]. And I thought it--and I thought, well, maybe it's--it was something like that. And even at that moment, I didn't realize the magnitude and the significance of really what was happening, that it was, indeed, a terrorist attack. And so I called the newsroom, and they're very busy. And they still don't have very many questions answered. And I told the news director, ""Okay. Yeah, I know you're busy. Let me get settled. I call you back later."" And I go and I get into a cab. Power of radio. And the cab is taking me to the hotel. And the top of the hour newscast comes on and it's a CBS Radio newscast. And the news anchor lays it all out. And I thought, oh, my--you know, oh, my God. America has been attacked. And I realized that I haven't talked to anybody other than the news director at the radio station. So I immediately thought I need to call my family. And I called my mom's [Mary Bates Pressley] office and the lady answers the phone, and I asked to speak to my mother, and she's like, ""Connie, is that you? Are you okay?"" And I said, ""Yeah. I'm fine."" She said, ""Do you know what's happened?"" I said, ""Yes. That's--I'd just real--I'd just found out what happened. I need to let you guys know that I'm okay.""

Speaker 2: So, but I moved here in 1991, and that was the moment that Clarence Thomas was being nominated for the [U.S.] Supreme Court. And I was involved in another national mobilization called African American Women in Defense of Ourselves, which really tried to add a different voice to the debate around Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. Anita Hill, of course, was the person that accused him of sexual harassment and almost derailed his appointment to the Supreme Court, and she was vilified as someone, you know, who was not trustworthy--she was making this up, she was trying to bring a black man down--and it was a very simplified formula because, of course, Clarence Thomas had, in many ways betrayed the interests of most black people long before Anita Hill's accusations, which I think were quite credible, came to the fore. Speaker 1: What voices in the black media were putting this case together, that she was dragging down--? Speaker 2: I don't remember all the names. I do remember Orlando Patterson from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] wrote a piece in The New York Times which was pretty troubling, describing his take on black male/female relations and framing this alleged sexual harassment in that context. And what his position was, was essentially that this was, that what Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of was a kind of flirtation that was common, and that she should have known that this was harmless flirtation, and not kind of outed him. So, you know, I can't even muster the words to express the extent of my disagreement with that, but that was one pretty vile interpretation. But even people like [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, for example, supported Clarence Thomas initially, and said, ""Look, he comes from a poor black background and if he's in there, if he's in the Supreme Court, his experience as a black man growing up in the South under adverse circumstances, that has got to kick in at some point. That has to have an effect on his judgment."" And certainly with all due respect to Maya Angelou, that has not proven to be the case. So, anyway, African American Women in Defense of Ourselves was a group of black women. We mobilized people to raise quite a lot of money in a short amount of time for a national newspaper ad campaign which was, it put an ad in The New York Times and a number of African American papers. We raised about fifty thousand dollars, which was a lot for us at the time. I realize it's probably not now. And sixteen hundred women signed a statement that basically said we felt that black women's voices were not being heard, that Anita Hill was being distorted, and it really was not about supporting Anita Hill in a sort of narrow sense as it was confronting all the misrepresentations of race and gender in the discussion around Clarence Thomas. And it was also indicting, you know, his conservative views as not being in the interest of black folks or poor folks. So that was a major mobilization, it took a lot of time and energy, and it was, you know, it was a success, a limited success. But we made a statement and there was an attempt to organize the women who had signed that ad into an organization after that. And there were networks that emerged and sustained themselves, but not for, you know, very long. Story_ID: 635911 Speaker 1: Would you say that what happened to Anita Hill was--kind of tapped a sore spot for the lot of black women that they hadn't really talked about before? Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't say that, actually. I think we had been talking about some of the issues that came out with Anita Hill. I mean, one of the issues was also the way in which race and gender get dichotomized. Sometimes in the press they were saying there are people who support Anita Hill as a woman and there are people who support Clarence Thomas as a man, you know, as a black man, I'm sorry. So there was the idea that there were black issues and then women's issues--and that sort--where does that leave black women? And part of our statement was of course--there's an intersection, as Kimberle Crenshaw [Kimberle Williams Crenshaw] and others have said, there's an intersection between race and gender and class and sexuality, and that we need to understand the relationship of all these things to each other rather than pitting them, you know, against each other, or falsely dividing the categories.

Anita Hill, of course, was the person that accused him of sexual harassment and almost derailed his appointment to the Supreme Court, and she was vilified as someone, you know, who was not trustworthy--she was making this up, she was trying to bring a black man down--and it was a very simplified formula because, of course, Clarence Thomas had, in many ways betrayed the interests of most black people long before Anita Hill's accusations, which I think were quite credible, came to the fore. Speaker 1: What voices in the black media were putting this case together, that she was dragging down--? Speaker 2: I don't remember all the names. I do remember Orlando Patterson from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] wrote a piece in The New York Times which was pretty troubling, describing his take on black male/female relations and framing this alleged sexual harassment in that context. And what his position was, was essentially that this was, that what Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of was a kind of flirtation that was common, and that she should have known that this was harmless flirtation, and not kind of outed him. So, you know, I can't even muster the words to express the extent of my disagreement with that, but that was one pretty vile interpretation. But even people like [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, for example, supported Clarence Thomas initially, and said, ""Look, he comes from a poor black background and if he's in there, if he's in the Supreme Court, his experience as a black man growing up in the South under adverse circumstances, that has got to kick in at some point. That has to have an effect on his judgment."" And certainly with all due respect to Maya Angelou, that has not proven to be the case. So, anyway, African American Women in Defense of Ourselves was a group of black women. We mobilized people to raise quite a lot of money in a short amount of time for a national newspaper ad campaign which was, it put an ad in The New York Times and a number of African American papers. We raised about fifty thousand dollars, which was a lot for us at the time. I realize it's probably not now. And sixteen hundred women signed a statement that basically said we felt that black women's voices were not being heard, that Anita Hill was being distorted, and it really was not about supporting Anita Hill in a sort of narrow sense as it was confronting all the misrepresentations of race and gender in the discussion around Clarence Thomas. And it was also indicting, you know, his conservative views as not being in the interest of black folks or poor folks. So that was a major mobilization, it took a lot of time and energy, and it was, you know, it was a success, a limited success. But we made a statement and there was an attempt to organize the women who had signed that ad into an organization after that. And there were networks that emerged and sustained themselves, but not for, you know, very long. Story_ID: 635911 Speaker 1: Would you say that what happened to Anita Hill was--kind of tapped a sore spot for the lot of black women that they hadn't really talked about before? Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't say that, actually. I think we had been talking about some of the issues that came out with Anita Hill. I mean, one of the issues was also the way in which race and gender get dichotomized. Sometimes in the press they were saying there are people who support Anita Hill as a woman and there are people who support Clarence Thomas as a man, you know, as a black man, I'm sorry. So there was the idea that there were black issues and then women's issues--and that sort--where does that leave black women? And part of our statement was of course--there's an intersection, as Kimberle Crenshaw [Kimberle Williams Crenshaw] and others have said, there's an intersection between race and gender and class and sexuality, and that we need to understand the relationship of all these things to each other rather than pitting them, you know, against each other, or falsely dividing the categories. Speaker 1: Okay. So, is the organization [African American Women in Defense of Ourselves] still in existence? Speaker 2: No, no. And this is another lesson from Ella Baker, because sometimes, you know, you work hard to get an organization, like going around meeting with people, please come to a meeting, I know you're busy, where are we going to meet, when are we going to meet, who's going to lead it, what's the issue we should focus on, how should we word something? It's a lot of work to move groups of people in rhythm with each other, right in an organization.

My family not only did it have the advantages of being the Sally Hemings in the slave world the bastard children of the owners--slave owners but also a number of Native American relatives in there so for people who had that kind of background and did not have to toil number one in the big farms in Mississippi the huge plantations which were Haitian style. They had the Haitian style of slavery which meant that they didn't care whether you lived or died. You can tell how brutal the farm was by how far away the master lived and most of the farms in Mississippi and Louisiana for example, the master's mansion is not like 'Gone With the Wind' [Margaret Mitchell] with your plantation right there with Scarlett [Scarlett O'Hara] waving happily at her happy slaves. Those slave mansions had to be--slave owner mansions had to be five, six, seven miles away because the farms were so brutal and you had to have black overseers because people were so--people enslaved on those plantations were so brutalized that it didn't even make economic sense to have them breed--to have them reproduce. So the Haitian model which was the most brutal model they simply worked you to death. It was actually worse than how animals were treated. The Virginia model of slavery which is what my family went through mainly especially for half-white slaves they were housed with a lot of indentured servants. Virginia had a huge number of white indentured servants and so the slave shack where my [maternal] great-grandfather [George Wigenton] lived and I think I said this before is actually in Amissville [Virginia]. So we had a completely different experience. Speaker 1: I think you said it was luxurious by comparison (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it had wood floors, it had a fireplace; that's where whites lived and so it couldn't be like the normal slave shack. So anyway from Orlando Patterson I learned the different systems of slavery. How the African--the different tribal systems for catching slaves because slavery was a joint enterprise. It was a capitalist enterprise between Africans and Africa and the different countries in Africa and from Arabs--Arab slavers.

That they should be punished for having children if they're receiving welfare and the--also the racialized images around welfare that these are black women who are irresponsible about having children and that they don't deserve assistance. That they--they're having children just to get a welfare check, this is a very common myth about welfare that was promoted especially during the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] administration. But I think it still exists today. And so I've tried to dispel those myths and also point out that policies that punish women for receiving--for having children while they're receiving public assistance are basically a form of eugenics.

And some of them would lose their lives. You could not expose them to that kind of threat and intimidation in the 1950s. There was no way that the NAACP was going to do that.

Come to the aid of this cause. And this cause was to represent the good and welfare and the interests of the black citizens in this country who had been so brutalized. As I said, this was immediately following the Springfield riots. And that gave birth to the NAACP. It was organized here in New York City [New York, New York] in 1909. Speaker 1: Do you know where that apartment--what the address of that apartment was? Speaker 2: It would have been--no, but it was midtown Manhattan. It was about located about 40th Street in midtown, West 40th Street in midtown Manhattan at an apartment. The--at the home of a couple who hosted the meeting. It was a small meeting with about five people, I think. And that marked the beginning. After the organization was established, and it was incorporated here in New York in 1910, nineteen--I think the articles was signed in 1911. You've had, let's see, Mary White Ovington served as executive secretary from 1916, I'm sorry, from 1911 to 1912. And then again, in 1916, for the year 1916.

I mean not say I'm gonna kill you or something like that, but give them some opportunity to, associate with the group, the organizations that are trying to help. Another thing is we, the educational system has to be such that a child is able to learn how to compete in this world with all the other people for jobs. If you can't read and write when you finish high school, nobody's going to employ you. It's bad enough because of racial prejudice when they don't employ you anyway, but when you know you have the equipment, and you have the resources, you have a way, of fighting back better.

You couldn't marry white, you couldn't marry each other. But it was that man who was spiritually connected to his mother who raised him, taught him his skills as a carpenter, cabinet maker, who loved and educated him. And I often, when I speak to young men of African ancestry, I said, to have children by women for whom you have no affection and have children that you do not expect to educate and nurture, that's not the African thing. The only person who did that was the slave owner. But black men raised the children born of the rape of their wives. And they did, many black men raised those mulatto children as their own.

Speaker 2: Sonny Perdue, everything, and I survived. And it was an amazing thing. I thought I was all alone in the beginning of the campaign. By the time it was--by the middle of the campaign, ministers were walking off the bench to bring me up into the pulpit. I mean, it had become that kind of--you ain't going down and we're not go--and I knew this may be tough, but I'm not alone and that was a good lesson to know. I mean folks were putting up signs all over the place. You know, hey baby, we ain't gonna let you go down. We ain't gonna do it. And that was a good feeling.

But I got an A minus on it anyway, so I just threw it up to the air and said thank you to the creator for my grade, even though I didn't think I deserved it.

He tore my show apart and added some kind of bizarre rendition of Christianity and put it in there. He invented a character who didn't exist, the Woman in White [sic. Lady in White], who [HistoryMaker] Whoopi Goldberg played. And he made the rape scene just bizarre. And, and so the woman couldn't accomplish what the poem accomplishes, which is to reaffirm her strength at the end of the rape scene.

And they had not ever had a black woman working in that production line that they had there. So they hired her to be a maid, something she had done in their houses. So she was a maid. She joined the union though, and she didn't let that be widely known because that was a bit controversial if you joined the union. She joined the union, and she was convinced at a certain point that she should apply for one of those jobs on the floor in the production line because she could make more money on an hourly salary. She did, and because she had seniority built up as a maid, she was able to get ahead of some others who had applied for that job. She got the job, and there was resistance to her having the job because she was black, and she was a woman. And it got so bad that white men would spread feces all over the men's restroom, knowing that she had to clean it up. They did all kinds of things to harass her. So she complained, and her union rep and also the person that was the supervisor took my mother's side and told the men that if they continued doing that, they were gonna lose their job. Anyway, it was a big thing for mama to go from being a maid to being a person working in production in this Ace Hardware factory. So that was the kind of thing they were doing. It was very quiet kinds of things, the things that don't make headlines. But in their own quiet ways, they were challenging the conditions under which they were living and working.

A violinist in the orchestra at the opera disappeared during intermission. And there was a big search, and ultimately, her body was found thrown off the roof and sandwiched between two buildings, kind of thing. In any case, it was a big mystery. And a lot of people who attend the opera are people who either own or edit The New York Times (laughter) or have friends who were there. So it was a big story from the jump because it affected that part of society in New York [New York City, New York]. And it was my story. So I did a lot of interesting stories related to that trial, and my greatest achievement, I think, was when the--we knew when the trial was opening, we knew at that point that the defendant had supposedly confessed. The defendant was a stage hand. And apparently, he had accosted the violinist, and tried to engage her in a romantic liaison. Of course, she was having none of that. And he ended up raping and killing her. Well, we knew that the prosecution said that it had confession, a confession from him, but we didn't know the content of the confession. So jump ahead, we're there at the beginning of the trial, opening statements by the prosecution and the defense. And the prosecutor gets up and tells us what he's going to prove. And he gives a narration of what happened from the time Helen Hagnes Muntiks, I think was the name, from the time she left the orchestra pit to the time her body was found. And as I'm listening to that, I'm thinking, he's telling us the confession. Who else knew this stuff except whoever confessed? So I wrote a story, rushed and wrote a story that said, we finally heard the details of the confession in the opening blah, blah, blah. So I go home, all proud of myself that I'd done this wonderful story, and late at night I get a call from the copy desk. You never want a call from the copy desk late at night. And they said are you sure that was the confession? And I said, yeah, I'm sure. They said, well, no one else...",raping,,,1/1/2000,,,USA,N,,yes,"Shipp, E. HM0",,,,,,,,,,Black or African American,,,

You had to write the story, just the facts kind of thing. Thankfully, I did because it turns out that the stage hand did do it, and the mother was kind of playing me. And the mother was doing what a mother is supposed to do, help her son (laughter). Another reporter got the same treatment from the mother, and she was a television reporter. She actually reported the story, very sympathetic, based on what the mom was saying. But I went straight down the middle, and later on, the detectives on the case actually thanked me for giving them the fairest coverage. And I had to say, you don't know how close I came (laughter) to questioning everything you guys were doing up there on the stand, but I was forced--and I think I learned that valuable lesson there, ""Don't let your feelings get in the way. Try to stick to the story."" And that helped me in other big cases that I covered over the years, including Mike Tyson's rape trial, many years later, where I had to hold my emotions in check because I felt very strongly there that the black establishment was siding with Mike Tyson because he was a celebrity and were ignoring the charges that a black woman, Sunday school teacher, no less, had brought against him. But I had to hold the emotions in check and focus on the facts. And the facts did make a better argument for his guilt than I ever could if I'd gone off the deep end. Speaker 2: Okay, and that's like the Mike Tyson case was in the early '90's [1990s], right? Speaker 1: It was about '91' [1991], '92' [1992], something like that. Speaker 2: That's right.

Speaker 2: Yes, she would play music all of the time if she could, but then she had to make some money because she and my father [Claude Groves] were separated, and he did send money but it certainly wasn't sufficient. You know, we're talking about the '30s [1930s] and that's right after the Depression [Great Depression]. So she then became a nanny to a member of the Rockefeller family and then she later worked for the Rockefellers herself, and something with housekeeping. She was never--my mother never was a cleaning woman, never, but her hands were beautiful 'til the day she died. But she had a lot of pep and interests in things and knew music and all that stuff, so she could fit in pretty well. So she did that until, I guess she retired, because the children had grown up a bit so she wasn't nanny anymore. And she had periods of time where she did stop, come to think about it, 'cause she had a severe arthritic attack, and I think then she didn't work for the Rockefellers, she worked for another family in Huntington [New York] and then--as a cook.

The father of the man was bothering her, making advances, and she wrote her sister up here who was working here in Huntington.

HM_Simmons_Debra.txt,,HM,"...and cronyism, and to get that broken down and to come up with a new structure that has, you know, leadership, you know, for the people by the people, where everyone has a seat at the table, really is significant. Speaker 1: Okay. So 2010, I guess, was a landmark year for those investigations? Speaker 2: Yes. That's when the sort of chickens came home to roost so to speak (laughter). Speaker 1: Yeah, I heard--well, this morning, [HistoryMaker] Harry Boomer again; he was saying another, you know, corruption scandal (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right. Speaker 1: --and he was talking about some other layer has been peeled back. Speaker 2: I mean that's the thing. What we really helped to do is unveil this whole culture of corruption and, you know, what has sprung from that is a whole series of investigations and a whole series of, you know, identifying pockets of mismanagement and misbehavior, and so, you know, when you think about journalism as a public trust, I mean I think that we most effectively fulfilled that role in the kinds of content that we're talking about here; but we're also doing it now around rape. As you know, 2013 was the year that three women [Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight] were found, you know, to have been locked in a house for a decade. Well, for the last three years, we have been pushing the state to do a better job of examining rape kits and, you know, I think our content, as well as, you know, other developments, have sort of moved the state to a place where it's more effectively and efficiently testing rape kits, and thousands of rapes are being resolved as a result of much of the work that we're doing. And so, you know, we are continuing to push to--particularly, you know, for poor women whose credibility is questionable, they've never--you know, they rarely have been able to get anybody to listen to their cries. And now the state attorney general [Mike DeWine] has made a commitment to testing every untested rape kit that's out there, and there are about four thousand, and they're about a third of the way through. And in some cases, the offenders are in custody; you know, they're right there but no one's ever tested and no one's ever asked, and so for many families, including families who've had people not just rape but murder, some of those murders have been resolved in the past year. In one case, a woman's daughter was killed thirty years ago and just gotten to a place where she knows what happened. But as it relates to the rape kits specifically, there's a twenty year statute of limitations, and so there's this race to get those tested before that statute runs out. Story_ID: 653800 Speaker 1: One of the reasons the whole discussion of the rape kits is important is, if you recall, in 2008, the bodies of eleven dead women were found either in the house or in the yard of a serial killer in Cleveland [Ohio]; his name was Anthony Sowell-- Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous). Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so if you look on our front page the day that Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was elected, when you get to the second front page [of The Plain Dealer], you see the developments around the Anthony Sowell murders. And so we had Anthony Sowell and, you know, that's discovered in 2008, and then in (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is an African American man-- Speaker 1: African American man-- Speaker 2: --living in--on the-- Speaker 1: --living on the east side of Cleveland who, you know, murdered women who were, you know, largely drug addicts who didn't necessarily have a lot of credibility with law enforcement. Since that time, other women have come forward to say, ""Yes, I reported being raped by him and the police didn't do anything."" So that really was the catalyst for this work. And then when you fast forward to 2013 and you see the Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight developments, it just makes the case for why this work is so critically important. So we're--you know, if we have to look at what was our signature content in 2013, in addition to covering the live story of the escape of these women who lived this decade of captivity, it's really the impact of our journalism on the potential to reduce this from continuing to happen; so, you know, we think that's, we think that's important. Even as we change the way that we're distributing content, we think that deep investigative commitment is our competitive advantage--it's what we can do that nobody else can do in this town.

But, they, they decided they actually needed to create a staff position for someone to deal with the allegations and things coming in 'cause generally how universities handled this was they would, you know, just try to handle it quietly through university channels and separate the two students, maybe move the guy to another dorm across campus so that they wouldn't be living in the same dorm or whatever. Speaker 2: You mean a guy who is guilty of sexual assault? Speaker 1: Well, I mean, keep in mind, universities are not courts of law. They are not judges and juries and often in cases of campus sexual assault, we see that it's his word against hers and there's alcohol involved or other drugs and the credibility of the woman is challenged and, you know, it's, it's a very--as we're--as we still see today, it's an extremely difficult, difficult issue.

That's an insult to the previous ownership (laughter).

If you're gonna say bad things about him, say bad things about the other four. Don't single him out and that's the only one you talk about. You know, maybe that's the one that the black community thinks should be different because we expect different things from black people, okay. But talk about the others too. Story_ID: 115137 Speaker 1: How did you feel, I mean about [President] George H. W. Bush, who seemed to be fairly moderate-- Speaker 2: Mm-hmm. Speaker 1: --appointing [U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice] Clarence Thomas to fulfill a seat vacated by [U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice] Thurgood Marshall? Now, people will say that's not so, necessarily the black seat but it is-- Speaker 2: Right, right. No, it isn't. Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, that's the only one we got. Speaker 2: No, it isn't. But it wasn't the black seat. And it was filled by a black person but we don't have a seat that says ""black"" and they have white and there's no Hispanic seat. I mean that, he should not have been expected to live up to the high, lofty standards of Thurgood Marshall. He was appointed by a Republican. Did we really think that this President was gonna replace this job with somebody who had those beliefs? And if you did, something is wrong with your thinking because he was gonna put somebody in the job that held to the same beliefs that he held. Speaker 1: Do, do, do you think that he really had the same beliefs or 'cause some would think that Clarence Thomas is to the right of George H. W. Bush? Speaker 2: Could be. Speaker 1: But I, I don't know. What do you think? Speaker 2: Could be. But he certainly wasn't gonna put another Thurgood Marshall in there. I mean that was not gonna happen. One of the things that I've said often, Clarence's beliefs are Clarence's belief. He's not mimicking [U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin] Scalia. He's not, he, he has his own mind. So to suggest that he is listening and he's being persuaded by someone else, really is not true. You know, if you don't like his beliefs, give him the credit for having 'em himself. But to try to say he's somebody else's puppet is wrong, you know. If you don't like the decisions, it's his bad decisions that you don't like. But it's not Scalia's bad decisions that he's mimicking. But if you don't like him and you don't like what he does because of what he does, add the other four in there but don't target him by himself.

But the [USS] Will Rogers is a ballistic missile submarine. That was, back in those days we had the nuclear triad, as far as the three areas of which the United States can launch missiles. And the ballistic submarine was part of the triad. To this date, the ballistic missile submarine is still--if you ask me, I will tell you it's the most important piece of nuclear deterrents because you know where the nuclear sites are if you're the enemy. Well, I don't care where you are, Russia, today, England, anybody. They know where our nuclear sites are in the United States. So, they can send an aircraft over here or a missile themselves, and wipe them out. You don't know where the submarine is. So that's why I say it's the most important piece of nuclear deterrent, because you have our nuclear weapons at sea submerged, and can't be detected. Speaker 1: So that triad is sea, land, and-- Speaker 2: Air. Speaker 1: Air. Thank you. So, the Cavalla was a-- Speaker 2: It was fast attack. Speaker 1: Fast attack. And you were the executive officer? Speaker 2: Yep. Speaker 1: And a ballistic missile sub--. I mean for other folks who don't know the nomenclature--ballistic missile, you're talking about what type of missiles? Speaker 2: You're talking about long-range missiles that can carry nuclear warheads. Speaker 1: Alright. Speaker 2: Okay. Now, I'm glad you brought that up, because on my command tour, we could shoot Tomahawk missiles. And most fast attack submarines now can shoot Tomahawk cruise missiles. And you launch cruise missiles against surface ships, and you launch them against close end targets on land. Speaker 1: Right. Speaker 2: Whereas a ballistic missile submarine--the ballistic missile can go, you know, a thousand miles, maybe even more in the air. Speaker 1: And when was the assignment for the USS Cavalla?

Speaker 1: Very good. Speaker 2: I always make it the point that I didn't stay in the Navy to become the first black commanding officer. I knew that if I went through and did my job, and completed all my qualifications and certs [certifications], I would eventually be assigned as a commanding officer. But my driver was to be a commanding officer, especially in the fast attack submarine. Because we did a lot of, a lot of fun, dangerous stuff. And I used to be very vocal, because this was back in the Cold War--that if we ever had to go to war against the Russians, the submarine force is the only portion of the military currently prepared to do what we need to do to take out the Russians. So, other than that, I won't tell you much more, okay. So, that stuff was fun, and only fast attacks could do it. And so, that was my driver. My driver was I want to be a commanding officer. I want to take one of these things and be responsible for monitoring the bad guys on the Spec Op, and I like this. And if I succeed, I will end up being the first black commanding officer. So, that's the driver. The driver was me liking Spec Ops. The driver wasn't me wanting to be the first.

And so typically, back in those days about 90 percent of the officers were successfully screened for submarine command. It's not a given, okay. But they do--and now it's even worse. It's extremely hard to screen for command nowadays. For example--are we going to get around to talking about the Centennial 7? Speaker 1: Yes. Speaker 2: Okay. So, when we talk about the Centennial 7, I need to, to give you an appreciation for how long it's been since we got a black in command.

That's not the way to talk about that."" But I also knew that black women who didn't talk about abortion knew more about it than they were willing to talk about because, don't forget, I had eavesdropped on my mother's [Velma Lee Moore] conversations with her girlfriends and I knew that there were women in our communities who had all of these homemade remedies for how to abort. I heard women talk about falling down steps, about women taking, douching in lye, about women taking turpentine--I heard all those conversations when I was a young girl, and I knew about midwives who performed abortions by dilating the uterus in St. Louis [Missouri] and in East St. Louis [Illinois]. So I knew that black women had abortions, but I also knew it was a very private thing. It was nothing that they talked about, but I knew that they knew how to do it and much of it was learned during slavery when black women aborted white babies that were the result of basically rapes by white. So I knew that, but I also knew that white women wanted to raise the level of discussion about abortions because they were talking about your right to determine whether or not you could do that. Black women already knew that if they wanted to do it, they were going to do it. It was nobody's business. White women were trying to get it accepted in the medical world. We didn't have the medical world. We didn't have the luxury of fighting for our doctors to do it. We had the ways to get it done and didn't get it done through doctors. This was done through midwives and other kinds of things that women learned how to do. So we were both talking about freedom of choice and the ability to make the decision if you had to, but we were talking about it in different ways, and so I learned early on not to take the language of the white women back to the black community. It didn't work.

And they said that it came from Africa, but it came from a monkey bite, and probably they carried it to Europe whatever came, you know, as a result of that monkey bite. And then it spread because men out in the bush and so on, they would come back to their villages, and maybe being bitten or something, and have sex with their partners, and that's how it spread. And it spread most rapidly on the continent of Africa because, A, they didn't have the technical understanding about how it spread, and they didn't have the resources to stop it.

Our gene pool wasn't in Asia, it wasn't in Korea, it wasn't in South America, it was in Africa and I wanted that known. So, and you know, I carried legislation, in Exposition Park [Los Angeles, California] we have the African American Museum [California African American Museum, Los Angeles, California], it's a state museum. And it was first called the Afro-American Museum [California Afro-American Museum]. Well, the African embassies here put up a big protest because on the whole continent there is not a word for Afro, the word is African. So I had to carry legislation to change the designation of that museum to African American not Afro. It's an insult, it's like calling you Neg. Speaker 1: Without the gro (laughter).

There was a right and a wrong about what people who had class did and did not do. And a cabdriver was one step above being, you know, somebody who was engaged in, in quasi-legal endeavors, or, or works. So cabdrivers were really not people that you wanted to associate with. But I didn't know anything about class and, and about what, what were the, what were the class limitations, the, the boundaries of class associations and communications. They were just guys that would talk to me when I would get on my tricycle and go around and talk to them and I'm sure they were as amused by, by my gregariousness and my exuberance as a child and, and I was not--and my extroversion, I guess was the word I was looking for, so I enjoyed it. I remember having a lot of fun going around talking to the guys at the cabstand. My mother [Ozie Garrett Wattleton], I'm sure she was worried that they were going to rape me or kidnap me or some such, such other, other heinous crime, but no one ever conducted himself in any way other than just a friendly cabdriver; just like the friendly Chinese restaurant owner on the corner.

I loved it. And when I went there recently I felt like I was in a sense going home. I knew all the subway stops and I, it's just I loved Madrid and I think part of it was that it was, color did not have, because of the Moorish influence in Madrid, they didn't have the same kind of issues that they did. Only America has the kind of issues that we had. I mean they're variations of racism certainly but the kind of deep seated racial or white supremacy racists that we have in this country is unique to America because of slavery, American slavery.

Brown High School, Charleston, South Carolina], and we would do testing, there was a whole lot of testing. I think that's when I first met the congressman. Then he moved to the farm commission, and the farm commission worked with high schools in getting students to college. Somehow or another the farm commission had a connection with Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and a lot of students were sent to Wilberforce. So, I started working with Jim Clyburn when he was director of the farm commission working with getting students into college, and then when I served in the legislature I worked with the Human Affairs Commission of the state when he was director, and we are now working on establishing an international African American museum in Charleston [South Carolina], the City of Charleston along with the mayor.

I was so affected by that, that trip to South Africa, not Johannesburg [South Africa], Durban [South Africa], Cape Town [South Africa], they just like being at home. Cape Town remind me of Charleston [South Carolina], but when you went out into the village, the villages where the schools were and when we visited the island [Robben Island, South Africa] where Mandela [Nelson Mandela] was imprisoned, you come back not with the feeling of legacy as far as your inheritance, but because of the struggle. That's how we connected to South Africa because of the struggle. But, to go in the village where there's no electricity, no running water it was unbelievable that people live that way today, and then South Africa is a developed country. It's not an underdeveloped country, but everything is centered on the city. And the whites there, you got the true meaning of no middle class. You're either upper class or you were lower class.

If you don't have a goal, as my colleague, Bernard Emerson [ph.] would say, ""If you don't' know where you're going, any road will get you there."" We need targets and goals for these affirmative programs and policies. He wanted to get rid of that because that's something the administration had wanted to do, changing the regulations or whatever. Now an executive order is simply that and it can be changed by a president at any time.

And, why, I mean you would think would be their interest of these big businesses and so forth, but it doesn't seem to be. I mean, what's your analysis of that? Speaker 2: My view was, this is clearly ideologically-based. We had, and we continue to have, a segment on what we call the right, that honestly believes that discrimination is, I mean, that affirmative action or taking an effort to inculcate and to include people of color in the workplace this way is an act of discrimination. I honestly believe that. I believe, with all due respect, that Mr. Thomas [Clarence Thomas], who was again at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC] at that time, for instance, shares that view.

They're the victims of discrimination if you visit some of the web sites, the Center for Individual Rights [Washington, D.C.], the Center for Equal Opportunity [Falls Church, Virginia].

In where the company had to pay thirty thousand dollars to clean up the walls, it was a small company, I walked through the headquarters and, and, like, you know, in fifteen minutes. If I could, if it was that small, then clearly, surely the CEO should have seen that, and affirmative action rules that you make an effort, an affirmative step to prevent discrimination. He should have had that stuff off the walls. The women shoudn't have been harassed the way they were, and the ""N"" word certainly shouldn't have been used. One guy was officially fired.

Obviously, they could always have a choice, but it is in their interest. Now, but we'll always have the push-back, you know. I have said before what we, we see in terms of these lawsuits, I think there's a fear, clearly fear and they see the handwriting on the wall, they see the demographics. I think there is a fear of losing one's control, and, as I've said in speeches, I learned how to share in kindergarten, and its coming, it's coming a time when their gonna have to, or we'll have a South Africa situation, where the small minority, racial minority, will be in control.

I work with colleagues that, for example, do sexual harassment prevention training in the [Washington] D.C. Department of Corrections. There was a major sexual harassment case brought by women, mostly black women, correctional officers, okay? And so again, these are African Americans and I, to the court's credit, they require this sexual harassment training of managers and staff and refresher training, and I think some companies need to take a look at that because not only for sexual harassment purposes, but racial harassment, as we talked about with the [Ku Klux] Klan raffle case in North Carolina.

When I saw that, I knew the Panther Party was not long in being. I loved their feeding program, their children's feeding program: the breakfast program. I thought their social action message was very powerful, but I think the character of the leaders, many of the leaders, the more visible leaders, the moral character had a lot to be desired. Speaker 1: Yeah, there have been stories written about various members of the Panther Party being involved in drugs and prostitution and a lot of different things. So, if not when they formed it, along the way somewhere, and other things. There's also been--as a black woman whose close to that movement, there's also been a strong critique about the way black women were treated in the Panther movement. Speaker 2: Exactly. Well, that's--I think that's not inconsistent with the way the Civil Rights Movement dealt with women. When Stokely Carmichael said the position of women in the movement is prone, I mean that was just an insult to all women of all races, and not different from the way women are treated in the church, where many churches today will not ordain a woman no matter how much formal theological education she has. So it's not--I think it is part of the African American culture. Speaker 1: That's a good point. The Panthers came out of popular culture. It is just a reflected of the culture they came out of.

Speaker 2: Well, the Caucus was formed during the time that [U.S. President] Richard Nixon waged an all-out assault on the war on poverty. I mean he waged a war on the war (laughs) on poverty. His attitude was there were no poor people in America, you know. And he actually--with the exception of Head Start [early childhood development program] targeted every program, every community development program, every program to be ended. And that's--those were the days when people like Gus--Augustus Hawkins, who was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, decided to rally the nation and African American people against that. So that was very important. We were able to save many programs from his ax, his budget ax. I would say that was probably one of the biggest victories of the Congressional Black Caucus during those days. And, of course, the Congressional Black Caucus dealt with other issues, women's rights, other social justice issues. Affirmative action was right around that time. Remember the Bakke case in 1972 [ref. to Alan Bakke's pivotal U.S. Supreme Court 'reverse discrimination' case against the University of California Davis Medical School] when there was an all-out attack on affirmative action, which was, actually evolved under Nixon with Art Fletcher, an African American who was involved with the [U.S.] Labor Department. That was [Assistant Secretary of Labor] Art Fletcher's baby, the concept of affirmative action. And Richard Nixon was President during that time. Well, by 1972, he was ready to put that, you know, an ax to that even. And so there was a lot of battles the Congressional Black Caucus had to wage around maintaining affirmative action.

It's just like African Americans, you know, when we enter certain leadership positions, because we've come out of a tradition where there's been some real challenges, sometimes that creates a real strength when African Americans, male or female, enter certain professions, whether it's medicine or law or business or computer science or whatever, we just bring that struggle. We don't collapse at the first sign of trouble. We don't just jump out windows if the business goes sour. We'll try it again, we're used to starting over. Women bring that commitment to details. Women are very detailed and are good listeners. People are hurting today and they don't necessarily want you to solve their problems. They just want a place to go to be heard sometimes. I think women are gonna bring an uncommon compassion that comes out of their own rejection in a society that's not prepared for women, that's gonna make a difference in--it's gonna make ministry, ministries of compassion a lot more readily available in churches that are filled with people who have drug and alcohol or problems, problems of spousal abuse, of child abuse and many other issues, the women are gonna enrich these ministries.

She had the same feelings about ETS [Educational Testing Service] as I did. And so we would get together and talk about how crazy these people were, these educated people were. And she would come to my house, I would go to her house. She'd been married before, she had a little girl. And, oh, I'll never forget, she gave me a birthday party. And she told me to come at a certain time, which I did. And the woman who was helping her said, ""I'm glad you didn't come early, because Alice had a fit."" And I said, ""About what?"" She said, ""Because the bakery had sent them chocolate muffins."" She was serving muffins, you know, to the guests. And I said, ""Well, what's wrong with chocolate muffins?"" She said, ""She thought it would insult you."" I said, ""That's my favorite dish,"" (laughter) you know, ""if I'm going to be eating chocolate. A chocolate muffin is fine."" But that, that was Alice.

I mean the question was an, almost an insult. You know, why would I do that? Why wouldn't you go with your husband wherever he's going, if he is the, if he is the, if he is considered the head of the household? Of course, some women nowadays are considered head of the household, and they expect the husbands to follow them. But it wasn't that way then. He was considered head of the household, and we have, in '67 [1967] we have, we have, we have five children. Our child together was not born until 1969, but we've got five children.

Speaker 1: Yes. Speaker 2: All right. Speaker 1: So that was probably my, one of my greatest accomplishments, at least on paper. I think that my greatest accomplishment though, was to serve as the mentor of African American youngsters who went to Old Dominion. There were very few of us on faculty, and so whether they were--of course, I was not teaching for a long while, as I was the associate vice president for student services. So I was available to them for whatever their problems were; whether they were not making the right grades, whether they were being harassed by a teacher, or they thought they were being harassed by a teacher. But I also did it for white students as well. They came with similar problems. The major, one of the major functions of that position was to decide who would be considered in state and out of state. Because there is an immense difference in the, in the tuition of in state students and out of state students. And I developed a criteria for determining who was in state and who was out of state, and applied that--saw that that criteria was applied to every student about whom there was a question.

No one to help her, no one to guide her, no one to help her through all that pain and I wanted to let people know, you know that she had been dealt that hand. So, I think I have done a lot of that.

Now, I've, I've told this story--I was not traumatized by the event. Speaker 2: So this is an older boy that did this to you? Speaker 1: He was about fifteen, and I was four. And I wasn't traumatized because my mother had prepared me. And I think much of the trauma that children experience from any kind of sexual molestation is that they're afraid to tell anybody because the person says nobody's gonna believe you, you're just a kid, or they make some threats. But my--I, I knew when my mama was telling me when I was three and four years that she didn't expect I would need this information that early, but I knew what to do, and I knew I was gonna be believed.
