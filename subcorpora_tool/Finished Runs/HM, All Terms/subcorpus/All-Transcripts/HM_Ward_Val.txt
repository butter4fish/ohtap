 Story_ID: 72645 Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to slate it. My name is Julieanna Richardson. I'm the interviewer and Paul Bieschke is the videographer and I'd like you to start out by stating your name and spelling it for us. And give us your birthdate. Speaker 2: Now I don't know if I'm tellin' you all that. My name is Val Ward. I'm known as Val Gray Ward. I was born, and this is really something I don't usually tell too much of anymore--Queenola Valeria Ward. So I married a Ward and I was born a Ward but not related, eight, twenty-one, thirty two [08/21/32] [August, 21, 1932]. Speaker 1: I want you to spell Val Gray Ward and I want you to spell Queenola. Speaker 2: Okay. It's really Valeria but Val, V-A-L, capital G-R-A-Y, capital D--I mean W-A-R-D, Ward. And my maiden [sic, birth] name was Queenola, Q-U-E-E-N-O-L-A, Valeria, V-A-L-E-R-I-A, Ward, W-A-R-D. Speaker 1: Okay, and you gave your date of birth, right? Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: And let's have today's date? Speaker 2: I don't know what today's date is. Speaker 1: June 2nd. Speaker 2: Okay, thank you, June 2nd- Speaker 1: Two thousand and two [2002] Speaker 2: Two thousand and two [2002]. Speaker 1: And the location, we're at the HistoryMakers. I need you to say it. Speaker 2: Okay, we're at the HistoryMakers at 1900 South Michigan [Avenue] in Chicago [Illinois]. Speaker 1: And I'd like to have your profession. Speaker 2: Actress, director and producer or mother or--let me start again--wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, actress, director and producer. Story_ID: 72646 Speaker 1: And I ask five questions of everyone, they're a little "People" magazine-ish, short answers. I'd like to know what your favorite food is. Speaker 2: Oh, just one or two? Just one, two--fish and greens. Speaker 1: Your favorite color? Speaker 2: Black and/or earth tones. Speaker 1: Favorite time of year? Speaker 2: Every season. Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination? Speaker 2: I don't know because I like to travel and fortunately I've traveled throughout the world and because I like our culture--"our" meaning black culture--but I like to find out about other cultures and other foods. I like all other parts of the word that I've been. Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying? Speaker 2: I once wrote a saying myself that says, "As we go into ourselves, we come to ourselves naturally." Story_ID: 72647 Speaker 1: That's nice, it's true. That's what happened with the HistoryMakers. We're gonna get started. I want to start out by asking you first about your father. Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: I would like to have his name and what you know about his background growing up. Speaker 2: Okay. My father's name was Henry Yarborough Ward but he just used H-Y. My father was a minister. An incredible man not just because he was my father--I described him upon his death, I guess, as a rock, a mountain of a rock. He was a wonderful man. He provided for his family. He loved to fish and what I know of him and what I was told that prior to him being a minister, he was a dancer and a baseball player. Right. And he was my mother's, I guess, only marriage but my father had children prior to my mother and father marrying. A funny thing happened when we were very small. My father was very light complexion and he didn't allow us to play with our shoes off. He just didn't believe in children going in their bare feet, right? And we would take our shoes off--born and reared in the South--in the oldest all black town in America. By the way, I want to get that in--M-O-U-N-D, B-A-Y-A-O-U, Mississippi. The ex-slaves of Jefferson Davis founded this town and I wanted to certainly put that in because it's something that you'll want--the HistoryMakers is going to want to do and find out more about but anyway, my father didn't allow us to play in our bare feet and when I was very young, the insurance man was always white, right? And that was before integration but because my town was all black, black mayor, black everything, judge, everything, the only people that would come in the town and that--or sales people were sales people and/or insurance man. So somebody would say, "Here come daddy," and we would think it was daddy and it was the white insurance man. So he was very, very light complexioned but--and I never found out until later--until--just before my mother died, why did my father, you know, we were born and reared in the South. Why couldn't we play bare feet? She said, no (unclear), your father saw too many children that didn't have shoes and he provided really, really, really well for us. I didn't realize how well we were off until, you know, I guess, I grew up in--to learn about all the things that people didn't have. I could discuss--I always had questions about religion and the Bible even as a small child. Speaker 1: Can we hold- Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: I want to go back a little bit Val- Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: --to see what you know more about his background? Do you know much--was he talkative (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: I know where he was born. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: No, he was very quiet. Speaker 1: Can you look at me too when you talk? Speaker 2: Yes. Yes. Speaker 1: 'Cause I do the same thing, looking at everything. Speaker 2: Okay. Okay. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: Yes, my father was born in Port Gibson, Gulfport, Mississippi. That's down near the coast in Mississippi. And, I really wish I knew more about his family. The Ward family was very small. I remember my father's mother, my father's father. He had one sister and one brother. And, I learned of a cousin when I was--two cousins maybe--growing up--or three cousins because Bessie Smith died at one cousin's house. But, I really didn't know too much historically. I really have wanted to find out more but my father was not loquacious as I am, yet he was a minister. Story_ID: 72648 Speaker 1: The one thing he provided for me always--people say how young did you start--when did you want to become an actress? As far back as I can remember and not until I was grown--and my children were, I guess, almost grown--did he pastor a church in my town. I will always say my town, Mound Bayou, Mississippi but from all the conventions very early he used to bring me the Chicago Defender, the Pittsburgh Courier. We got the Crisis magazine. We had a paper in our town called the Mound Bayou Advocate--man by the name of Isaac Peterson, our own newspaper, our own press and everything. But my father always brought me these poetry books and because I've always liked reading and making up stories and characters and so forth. And that's one of the things he, more than anybody, I think understood me and answered my questions. My mother, whom I'm sure we'll talk about later--very religious woman but you couldn't ask any questions or you couldn't disagree or you couldn't ask--that's just the way it is--you knew about the bible or what have you. But my father--we talked of so many things and then about twenty years or thirty years, maybe before--twenty years before he died, I got a chance to fish with him. When I was a child, he never took girls or any of us--one brother had gone fishing with him. But--in my later years--in my adult years, I got a chance to just be out on the back of the Mississippi with him on his boat, you know. He was really afraid of snakes but he fished and he would take me fishing and we would go out there and sometimes--yuck--I would--I loved to fish, as you know, and I would get so filled up--just being--it was so serene and so wonderful, just being out on the water. He would say, "Girl, what kind"--he would say "Girl--what kind of fish do you want to catch, right?" And I said, "A cat fish or-they had crappy or different"--and he say, "Well, get that mess"--talking 'bout my reels, my fish and I got these expensive reels, right? He said no, 'cause bamboo poles at different length but he knew what kind of fish, you know, and I would sit out there with him and I would have tears streaming. And he would say, "Why are you crying, is something wrong?" And they were like tear of joy because as a child, he pastored these churches either in Memphis [Tennessee] or in Arkansas and he provided all the material things for us but never did I get a chance to spend time and, you know, with him, growing up, he would, you know, never whip me but one time and I almost died that time, you know, he was having a meeting and my sister was playing, go down in the well. I don't know if you--no, you are not old enough to know that but it's the way they rear the chair back and say, how deep? And you'd say, "How deep?" And my father came from the living room to where we were and said, please stop the noise, I'm having a meeting. And my sister carried the chair back and dropped the chair and my father, for the only time in my life, took off his belt. I think I was about fourteen and whipped me and that hurt me so bad. And not the licks hurt so--but just the idea of him whipping me but a wonderful man, a wonderful father. And he really provided for us. Story_ID: 72649 Speaker 1: Do you know how he got from--you said he was originally from- Speaker 2: Gulfport--Port Gibson, Port Gibson, that's where he was born, Mississippi. Speaker 1: Okay, do you know he got from Port Gibson- Speaker 2: To the Delta [Mound Bayou, Mississippi]? Speaker 1: Yes. Speaker 2: I don't know because his mother, who was a Miller, his father was a Ward. And it's really ironic because my husband and I have relatives by the same name and probably--a lot of the older people but he's from Georgia and I'm from Mississippi. I think the Millers maybe already lived in the [Mississippi] Delta. They might have been some of the earlier people who came from like Vicksburg [Mississippi] and that's where these quote ex-slaves of Jefferson Davis and his brother, Joseph [Davis] migrated up to the Delta and Illinois Central, which was just--used to be at 12th Street, right here [Chicago, Illinois]. They needed this land cleared and these people founded this black town and they would give these people so much land if they would clear so much for the railroad. And so I don't know--I have not been able to find out, but I plan to go back to Mound Bayou [Mississippi] because a friend of mine, this historian, Milbourn [J.] Crowe, you might want to write his name down, for the town. And the Millers might have come earlier--that's my grandmother's side of the family--but I really don't know much about the Ward--where they were prior to that. My mother's side of the family, I do know about when one side of her family is very historical so I know more about that. Story_ID: 72650 Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about your mother. Can you give her name and- Speaker 2: Yes, her maiden name was Iola (sp?) Williams but when she married my father, she became Iola Ward. She was born in a place called Shubuta, Mississippi. And I think that's an Indian word and it's near the Alabama and Mississippi border. Speaker 1: Do you know how to spell it? Speaker 2: Shabutu [sic, Shubuta], I think is spelled like it sounds phonetically, S-H-A-B-U-T-U [sic, S-H-U-B-U-T-A]. I know it's an Indian word, Shabutu [sic, Shubuta], Mississippi. And they owned a lot of land--these relatives did but I don't know about the Williams' side but her mother's side were--the name was Pruitt, P-R-U-I-T-T. And they could go all the way back to their African ancestry, right? And they were some of the first people to attend and tu-tu-tu (ph.) gave birth--to help give birth to the Piney Woods College in Piney Woods, Mississippi and you probably have talked to some people already--and that's another place that you really should find out more about, Piney Wood College in Piney Wood, Mississippi. Anyway I'm told that the Pruitts, my great uncle just died in Berkley, California--and he lived there for about maybe like seventy something years, right? But he was part of the original Cotton Jubilee Singers. The Cotton Jubilee Singers--and I've got one of those photographs--why didn't I bring that--of the original Cotton Jubilee Singers and they were like the Fisk Jubilee Singers. They went about throughout the country and foreign countries to raise money for the schools, right? Well, he was one of those people and some of the same things I do today, James Weldon Johnson and all that. My uncle did that--that reciting--another aunt--so that--there's a continuity--to my--I though, you know, like I'm big deal doing--now--and then I understand his grandmother taught them some--I don't know if it was Yoruba--what--Hausa or what, but songs that were in that language and his--either grandmother- I guess taught with Booker T. Washington and so they were like really proud, almost arrogant black people. Story_ID: 72651 Speaker 1: My mother's mother, had she been alive in the '80s [1980] and '90s [1990], she'd be a multi-millionaire, you know, her name was Anna Mae. She was Williams when she was married to my mother's father but after that she became Anna Mae Moten (ph.). And she used to have these big picnics, that, you know, I'm doing this cookbook and I'm gonna name it "Anna Mae's Kitchen", like the Fourth of July and she would have what they called--I thought it was trust but now I found out that it was a truck patch, right? And she raised all the various foods, everything. She sold to--it was A & P and Kroger--I don't know if those stores--Kroger still exist but she sold vegetables and things to them and on holidays like the Fourth of July or whenever they had--I think they used to sell--I don't know why they celebrate it May Day or whatever. She used to have these big platforms made and she would have this man named Skeeter and I don't know how he was my cousin who blow--blew the harmonica--she'd have a dance floor. She was a producer, right? And she would have people bar-b-cueing goat, entire pigs, homemade ice cream. She must have employed, at that time, when I was a child, twenty-five or thirty people. They would be all week getting ready for the Fourth of July because--and people would come by the hundreds. [HM] Francis [Ward] just told me--since I been here--since I came in from this--that I don't know if it was PBS or somebody did a story on someone, I guess, I don't know, maybe the young man that's doing the documentary doing picnics and he said, "It just reminded me of the stories that you've told about your grandmother." And she did these wonderful--that was my mother's mother. And she was the most arrogant, wonderful woman. She always drove Chrysler cars and when I was really, really small, she had two cars--a fishing car and a maybe, I don't know, a Ford or something. You had to come in her back clothes, if you had on--we had a--back door--if you had on regular clothes 'cause anytime you sit down to her table, she would set the table with everything--the water, the glasses and everything and they had three meals--breakfast, dinner, lunch and each time she would completely set and you had to eat everything put in front of you. And she had--I don't know where she got all of her money 'cause I never knew of her working since--in my childhood but these people worked for her and people called her Ms. Annie Mae, right? And when Dr. Howard, T. R. M. Howard, I'm sure you've heard of him. He came to Mound Bayou [Mississippi] from Arkansas, to work at the hospital and then my grandmother helped him to build a clinic and he had his own clinic and he had his own everything. We had our little zoo, swimming pool and everything. He then became president of a bank in Memphis [Tennessee]. My grandmother, at this time, loaned him over twelve thousand cash. She was incredible. She was an incredible woman and I didn't know, because we were so protected in living in this small all black town, you know, it had its own library, its own school, own hospital, everything--that I didn't know about a lot of the prejudices and stuff that went on in the South until Emmett Till was killed well, by that time, I was in Chicago [Illinois] and--but my grandmother became ill and she died very young--now I know is young--younger than I am now. And, people would say--they'd bring her money when she was sick 'cause she had diabetes. And she'd say, no, put it there for the Civil Rights or the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] people--had two cups. And she was--she never--she wouldn't take money, you know, from people for her, you know, I know, I'm well taken care of. And, so that's the kind of background, I guess that I came from, my mother. My mother had a lot of her mother's ways but even more religious though. My grandmother, my mother came from a Methodist, my father was Baptist and they thought that was marrying down, you know, to marry--people have all these crazy things. My mother was totally different. My mother liked things and stuff and, and I loved her and she loved me but, you know, she would tell you, that's a so-and-so sheet you're lying on or these are so-and-so shoes, whatever. Matter of fact, she willed me a fur length coat that she bought from Nordstrom's furs. And I said, "Momma, I don't wear fur." She said, "You don't wear fur 'cause you can't afford fur," but I stole, she's dead now and I gave it to my daughter, but very protective parents. Story_ID: 72652 Speaker 1: Let me ask you, did she talk any about her growing up and do you know how--her family got to Mound Bayou [Mississippi] also? Speaker 2: People call it the hills and the [Mississippi] Delta. You've probably heard that from someone else. And the--Shubuta is--in the hills, by Jackson [Mississippi], by Alabama (unclear). And, so her father--it's crazy because my grandfather, on my mother's side was a Methodist--what--presiding elder of whatever. But I think he was kind of a nomad. I think that they just moved from place to place and I don't know, now in my grandmother, who was a Moten later, Anna Mae--I don't know when they were separated, I don't know what age my mother and--I gotta really find all that out now. But I don't know when they came from the [Mississippi] Delta--I mean from the hills to the Delta, yeah, but I'm sure my sisters and brother, not my sisters and brothers but my sisters and brothers that still live in the South. Story_ID: 72653 Speaker 1: Now give me your, your siblings' name in order. Speaker 2: Starting, my oldest brother is named Henry Ward, after my father and he's now a minister. I'm next, that's Queenola or Val. And my sister, Anne or Annie Christine who lives in Romeoville, Illinois is next. By the way, my brother still lives in Mound Bayou [Mississippi] and didn't know anything about farming but now he's raising potatoes, sweet potatoes with all--Alcorn College [Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi], this--you know how the colleges have the farms and they test the foods and so forth, so he's doing that now to help--to help the farmers and so forth. But he didn't know anything about any of that so that's what he's doing now. So I've a sister and Anne that lives in Romeoville [Illinois]. I have the next sister is--Doris Seller. She was Doris Ward and she owns Precious Beauty Salon here in Chicago [Illinois]. Then I have a sister, Sarah, who lives in--not south Harland--whatever that's next to South Holland [Illinois] and I have--next is my sister who lives nine miles from Mound Bayou [Mississippi] in Cleveland, Mississippi, that's Marva. And then I have a brother, Tyrone Ward, who's in Houston, Texas. And then Harold Ward, my youngest brother, who is--what is he a circuit court judge or whatever, he was just a judge in Mound Bayou [Mississippi] for like twenty or thirty something years. And now he's recently been appointed judge of the county or something. Speaker 1: So that's a total of (coughing, unclear) Speaker 2: Eight. Speaker 1: Eight kids? Speaker 2: Hmm hmm. Speaker 1: Now Val, let's, you know don't refer to me, don't refer to me (simultaneous). Speaker 2: Okay. Story_ID: 72654 Speaker 1: I would like to have you--do you have an earliest memory of growing up? Speaker 2: Do I have--oh yes, oh yes. Speaker 1: Your earliest one though. Speaker 2: My earliest--I don't know--I have tried because--I've tried to Gwendolyn Brooks, as you know, I mean, you don't know. Well anyway, Gwendolyn Brooks tried to get me to write my autobiography, matter of fact, she bought me a book and instead--I've been doing it in a quilt and she still tells me, "Yeah, Val but you still have to write." So I don't know what my earliest memory--I've tried to think but it always has something to do with--I can remember very, very early, maybe my first photograph and I don't know why this stays with me, someone had, I guess, men might still have long rubber boots and there's a small girl--I was at my father's mother's house, Sarah Ward and I--they put my foot in this boot so the boot is so--almost as tall as I am and that picture, I can remember. And people say, well, when did you start reciting or doing drama? I don't know because it's as early as I can remember being in church and I had to learn all of these parts and then we used to call the big school--prior to--we have private schools in Mound Bayou [Mississippi], and this was before Headstart and all that 'cause that's way after my time. And there was a woman named Alice Morris, I used to go to her--attend her school, prior to going to the big school and she taught me--you had to take piano and very early drama, and she used to also play for Sunday school and I can remember very clearly, I can remember all of that. I can remember the kids I--I mean people that are now really older adults, that I grew up with and the things that we used to do. Whenever I do my autobiography, it will be named 'Piece The Way Home' because I had a girlfriend who now is a retired teacher and Lois and I, her father was the postmaster. And she lived about as far from me as maybe to--this is 19th Street, maybe 16th Street, directly in front of me, and the only thing that separated the two, maybe a couple of streets but the Illinois Central Railroad. And we used to walk each other with what is called, 'Piece the Way Home,' and you had to be in your yard before sundown. Now you could see from her house to my house, but we would just walk from place to place. I remember that very vividly and that has stayed with me. I can remember other teachers from this Alice Morris to my first teachers in grammar school. I can remember poetry from my grammar school years, all those kind of things I can remember. Speaker 1: Well, tell me- Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Gotta stop the tape. Speaker 1: Okay. Story_ID: 72655 Speaker 1: Just have you take yourself back to Mound Bayou [Mississippi], you know, in the early--in your early years- Speaker 2: Hmm hmm. Speaker 1: And I'd like you to tell me what sights, smells or sounds remind you of growing up. Speaker 2: Hmmmmm, I wrote a play once and it's ironic that you would ask me that because those are some of the things that I--that the play came out. Some of the sounds were the Illinois Central Railroad which was like half a block from my house and the train that the people called the Pevine [Pevine Creek] or the nine o'clock train, you could tell what time it was because of the various trains. Also, in my early childhood, the--they would sometimes stop the freight train to block where you would go across to go to school, right? And so the freight trains would go "boom-a-loom-a-loom-a-loom" and would stop and I was always afraid. Boys would go across--crawl up and go over that thing but the girls would go through it. I'd just stand there and be crying because I was afraid. That will stay with me all of my life. It doesn't run--the train doesn't run there anymore. Chinaberry trees--I don't know if you know what a chinaberry tree is--it's a tree with yellow-like berries and we used to put 'em in our mouth. It has a seed, a gorgeous seed and we'd put a lot of it in our mouth and chew it up--I don't know--but that--when it was--it was greenish when it was young and it was--afterwards it would turn--when it was ripe, it was yellow. We used to chew that up. We had a lot of mint around my house--mint, just mint that grows. It would just grow wild, I guess. Also, wild onions and I remember my mother would just put--I think it's garlic now--but people said it was wild onion--and she would say when she was making spaghetti--she would say go and break me some of this stuff, you know, whatever. And, but that just grew wild. That sound. Also, even today, I'm afraid of storms. My father was really, really afraid of storms, storms and snakes, those two things. And he made us afraid of snakes and storms. And they--we didn't have storms like they have tornadoes and things now. I don't remember them but outside of our house--we have a big--I hope maybe I brought some of the pictures--but, my house had a big front yard and a big quote backyard. And there was a--I don't know--transformer--I think they call 'em, a light pole with a big [electric] transformer out--that's on the side within the lights, right? And when the storms would come, a ball of fire would come off of that transformer, "puuuuge" (ph.) and fall into our yard. And my father would say, first of all, you had to cut off everything, lights and everything, no listening to--we can listen to radio, I used to put the radio in the bed. I'll tell you about that later on--talkin' 'bout sounds. But my father would make us get up and put on all our clothes and my mother would say, "Reverend Ward, if the storm is gonna blow them away, what good are clothes gonna do?" He would say, "Iola be quiet. Put on your clothes, put on your shoes and socks," and you--we'd have to get up and be waitin' in our clothes. And so were afraid of the storms but you would hear--and if the wind would blow, right? Story_ID: 72656 Speaker 1: Another thing--and I wrote about this in this play, we very seldom had snow but, at that time, when it did snow, people used to catch the snow off of the top of the house and we made snow ice cream. Matter of fact, I had--you probably remember that play that I did. And I talked about--that's just so wonderful and I put a lot of things that I remember that did not, you know, happen to me but people used to take a big dish pan and they would take the snow--'cause the snow was clean and pretty, right, if it would really snow and then mix it with Pet milk and vanilla flavor and sugar and stir this up and everybody would have a bowl of snow ice cream. So that was wonderful and I remember that that tasted so good. And so people would be--that sound--if it--is it snowing, you didn't hear it but if it was sleet, oh it's sleeting 'cause it would sleet over and you would get the ice storms. So those are some of the sounds that I remember. Also, in the town, now I realize that there wasn't a lot to do. But because we were kind of contained--everybody went to the basketball or football game, planting the maypole, whatever. We had operettas. We had concerts. They did Negro spirituals and I recited things like 'Thanatopsis' and [by] William Cullen Bryant and Edgar Allen Poe. I didn't realize then how fortunate--that I thought all schools and everybody did this. But those are the things and those are the sounds that, you know, everybody and the little--the bands would go through the town, you know. The town now is so small, it's not as far as I walk (laughter), you know, but I thought it was big and, at that time, and please let me tell you this and--I don't know if Milbourn [J. Crowe] is gonna tell you this but some of the people were so well off and they had--either gone to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] or, at that time, Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]--sent their children and other people's--had sent their kids off to Virginia State [University] or different state schools so far, but when I was a child, there were a couple of black people that had black servants that had to come in their back door. And people have never--that's something else--southern middle-class--and some of them weren't even middle-class but their relatives were the founders which were-they were ex-slaves, Jefferson [Davis] and Joseph Davis. But that gives you a special honor in my town if you're the child of a--and some of these people were really, you know, well off, they had gone to Oberlin [College, Ohio], you know, 'cause some of the papers of these people's or--and their daughters are at Oberlin [College], so forth. And--but they've had black servants and they had to wear white uniforms and the black servants had to go in the back door. And I remember all those things. Story_ID: 72657 Speaker 1: Yeah, I wanna go just to the, you know, the history of Mound Bayou [Mississippi]- Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: --What you know about it--what is its history? Speaker 2: You know, I don't know if I brought that, but I can send a book back to The HistoryMakers or Milbourn [J. Crowe] can give you a lot of--'cause he's one of the people that you should interview that has a lot of the history, when it was founded, a lot about Isaac T. Montgomery and Benjamin Green. I know- Speaker 1: Can you just tell me what you know? Speaker 2: Oh my God, Julie[anna Richardson], ggggrrrrr, I shouldn't have said that but, well you can edit that out. Speaker 1: We're not editing though. Speaker 2: You're not? Speaker 1: hmmmm mmmmm. Speaker 2: Oh my goodness, I have to be careful what I say then, particularly about some of my friends in Mound Bayou [Mississippi]. A lot of things that I know that I wanted to write in my book but mother wouldn't allow it but my mother died last mother's day, meaning 2001. There some things that people don't talk about in Mound Bayou [Miississippi] that needs talkin' about, that people really, really know. I can tell you that a sheltered life and a middle-class-what we thought was middle-class life--'cause my father had a car and my mother had a car and we went on vacations and so forth. And there is a lot--was a lot of farmland but people like [Eugene P.] Booze--oh, what was [Eugene P.] Booze name? And there's a book by--his last name is [A.P] Hood ['The Mound Bayou, Mississippi Story'] on Mound Bayou [Mississippi]. He used to be the train station--we had a big--I thought it was big then--train station that went from one end, almost the length of the downtown--and this man, A. P. Hood, I think is his name, wrote a book on Mound Bayou 'cause I've read--done some research and--two scholars, I think one at Harvard [University, Massachusetts] and someplace else or maybe [University of North Carolina at] Chapel Hill did their Ph.D. on Mound Bayou [Mississippi] and I remember a couple of big fires when I was small, oh yes. When--I don't remember what or why this big--one time all the stores used to be connected to one another. And they almost--all burned down. Story_ID: 72658 Speaker 1: And I don't know if somebody white came in 'cause white people really had a, you know, they said the quote "Negroes in Mound Bayou were uppity" or if a white person was to be arrested, people are suing them now--they still suing them today in 2001. You had to wait until somebody came or white officer came from Merigold [Mississippi] or Shelby [Mississippi] or Clarksdale [Mississippi] because they couldn't arrest the white person. I mean I could tell you so many things about--its very interesting and yet it was closed-Parchman [Parchman Farm, Mississippi State Penitentiary] Prison, which is one of the oldest prisons, I guess in America and you've heard--toodoo--what's the folk singers sing a lot from prison--oh, what's his name--can't think of it now. But when I was a child, black prisoners would break out but--and all they had to do was get to Mound Bayou [Mississippi], and if you got to Mound Bayou, then somebody would take you because [Route] 61, the historical [Route] 61 runs right up from New Orleans [Louisiana] to Memphis [Tennessee] and that was a lot of the ways that people came from the South to the North and people used to break out of the prison at Parchman [Farm, Mississippi State Penitentiary] and all you had to do was get to Mound Bayou [Mississippi]. Somebody would put you up, somebody would put you in a car and whatever and take you on. So that was sort of like the underground railroad or if somebody heard that someone black on a plantation had had a fight with their boss or whomever, whatever. Because black people--and even today--own so much of the land and Mound Bayou [Mississippi], itself, proper is small and I think now it might be down to like one thousand people but everybody knew everybody. But land--did people own, you know a lot of land and--farmland and--but there's some stories of this family, Booze (ph.) and you can ask Milbourn [J. Crowe] more about it. Speaker 2: Val, let me ask, oh sorry- Speaker 1: Yeah, no, that's okay--'cause they were members of the--at that time, most blacks, I guess, were republican. And, as far as I can remember, my parents voted, even before the Voting Rights [Act 1964] but then who were they voting for? They were voting for like (unclear) and these people, you know what I mean? All they had to do was pay their quote--I would hear them talk about poll tax and fill out whatever 'cause these people owned the property and they voted, but they couldn't vote anybody--but now all the little towns--other towns have black mayors and black whatever, you know, all over, you know. But when I was a child this family, I'm tellin' you about [Eugene P.] Booze was real high up in the republican party and he was killed and that's one of things that people won't talk about, even today--I don't know if Milbourn [J. Crowe] would tell you but--I mean--just one night, these people came in and shot him or killed him and people won't talk about that. One of the first girl babies, born in Mound Bayou [Mississippi]--well, you know her great grandson, Strong, that was--Dr. Edward Carlton West. You know Dr. Strong? Well, Dr. Strong used to work in Carton's office--that's my--his mother was my teacher but his grandmother was the first--great grandmother--was the first girl child and she was a child of Benjamin Green, Isaac T. Montgomery and so you can find a lot on Isaac T. Montgomery and Benjamin Green. I should be able to tell you more but I just can't think of it right now historically. Story_ID: 72659 Speaker 1: Now I want to go back to your family life and I want to know--why I even want to know what you were like as a young person. Speaker 2: Loquacious and people always said that I asked too many questions 'cause I was never satisfied--be it the bible and why people always talkin' about--there were missionaries that were going to Africa because in my town, there were like, I don't know how many Methodist churches but there was M-E, Methodist Episcopal, all these little churches that might not have had the Baptist and Bethel had the big membership but these other churches might have had ten or fifteen people but all the different churches, you know, every kind of church you can think of. And I used to ask questions, people say--and the missionaries are going to Africa and I would want to know why did the missionaries, you know, have to go there because you were taught--and thank God a lot of black history--and I knew of Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman or Margaret Walker's even for my people or James Weldon Johnson's creation or his seven sermons and 'Lift Every Voice And Sing'. We did that along with 'Oh, Say Can You Sing' [sic, See] every morning. That was just part of what, you know, when the kids in the 60s [1960s] say, "Oh, sister Val, they got this wonderful new song," all of my life, I can't tell you when, because you were taught that, and I didn't know how rich that was. When I came to Chicago [Illinois], I thought everybody knew black history and knew about Mound Bayou [Mississippi] because people used to come and visit us from all over the world, black and white. Used to come to my town and swim and I just thought it was the epitome so when I moved to Chicago [Illinois] and found that people lived south of 12th Street and a few lived on the North Side [Chicago, Illinois], I couldn't believe it, you know, and the first time I came, I think was in '47 [1947]. My mother brought me on vacation and my aunt took us--she did all of her shopping at Sears and Stop and Shop downtown [Chicago, Illinois] but she lived at 53rd and Wabash, right? And, as the bus or the train or whatever would go further south, you would see it become blacker and black and black and I asked my aunt, I said, "Well, Chicago isn't all the things that people talk about, right?" And so it wasn't until I ran into people like Margaret Walker---Margaret Walker?-[HM] Margaret Burroughs and Gwendolyn Brooks and others that I really found, you know, what I had been exposed to all of my life, there in the South. Story_ID: 72660 Speaker 1: Now you're--can you like give me your elementary school? Speaker 2: Mound--well, this first--my first preschool was Alice Morris and then my high school--I don't remember if it was--they changed its name so many times but Milbourn [J. Crowe] can tell you now. They changed it from M-B-H-S, Mound Bayou High School to Mound Bayou Training School and I don't know when these various things took place as they saw integration was going to come about because it also used to be a training school. There used to be [Mound Bayou Industrial College] Baptist College there in the town. I can remember that and people say I shouldn't remember it but I do remember it. There used to be a training school where people would go, I think after they finished high school that their people didn't send them off to college. They became home-ec[onomics] teachers and so forth and it was a training school. I guess they went two years and then they could teach or something. And all of these things existed. But anyway I went to Mound Bayou High School--I went to Alice Morris first and there were like two major schools, preschool, B. O. Felder was one woman and she was one of the first women graduates, I think of Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois]. This woman was incredible and one of the greatest scholars today, in the world, and I'll give you his name later and how you can contact him because he has been a tremendous scholar at Charlottesville [University of Virginia] but now he--I guess he's in Washington [D.C.]. He was an advisor also to Bill Clinton. But anyway this woman school, B. O. Felder and Alice Morris--private schools. People sent their children there before they went to the big school unless they were like really poor and had--I don't know--it had to be so cheap then but whatever, we went to private school. Then to Mound Bayou High School--grammar school--where I finished and I think it was MBA chess. In high school, I finished, I got two scholarships, one for leadership and one for oratorical and at the same time--what's driving Miss Daisy's name? Morgan Freeman was over at Greenwood [Mississippi] and I won an oratorical for doing [William Cullen Bryant] 'Thanatopsis' and he did [William Ernest Henley] 'Invictus', I think, in the hills at--oh my goodness--what is the name--I think Harris High in someplace--anyway I did oratoricals all over the State of Mississippi because I can tell you very, very early, I did all this 'Invictus', 'Thanatopsis', William Cullen Bryant, Annabel Lee, all of these things but I was always taught this black stuff so when I finished high school, I got two scholarships, one for leadership and one for oratorical-- Story_ID: 72661 Speaker 1: When you were in school, were there people, specific teachers that influenced you, you know, or thought you were special? 'Cause a lot of times in the black community, people--kids would be chosen, you know, for certain talents? Speaker 2: Well, you know when I think of it now--two of the people, or maybe three--I think the one thing about growing up then in Mound Bayou [Mississippi] is that I think that they made you feel important made you. When I say you--it's made everybody feel important and maybe because I like drama as early as I--I remember people saying to me, "Oh my God, does she think she who she is or she's proper this"--but I had teachers. I had a woman from Bennett College [North Carolina] in--it's next to Shaw--was in North Carolina, I guess. I remember she used to sit at the piano and she'd play Billie Holiday's da-da-da-da-da--the day he come along-'The Man I Love'. And I would stand beside her, this woman, Alice Morris, who went to Tougaloo College [Mississippi] and I was encouraged in school to do all these things. I used to play two and three parts, even boys. And in my one woman show, now I do seventeen characters and I do men, women--but I was--real early in school--so I think I was encouraged by that. Now kids used to say to me, "Oh, she think she something or she tries to talk so proper," you know but that was something else. And if you're from Mound Bayou [Mississippi], people would say, if you go to Cleveland [Mississippi] or Memphis [Tennessee] anybody to the store (unclear) and you say--we didn't say yes mam or no mam, we said, "Yes, ma'am or no, sir," you know, and they'll say, "You must be from Mound Bayou." And you'd say, "Yes, sir or no, ma'am," and people would always say, you have to enunciate, you had to pronounciate [sic]. So to me, I guess, it wasn't special because I was doing all those things and one of the poems that I can remember today and I think it was William Cullen Bryant. I don't know--I should know if it--but it was a poem that very early--I don't know what grade I was--fifth or sixth. [Edgar Albert Guest, 'It Couldn't Be Done'] "Somebody said that it couldn't be done but he with a chuckle replied that maybe it couldn't but he would be one that wouldn't say so until he tried. So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin and he whirred the thing as he hit it. He started to sing as he tackled the thing that couldn't be done and he did it". I remember that from grammar school and I believed those things then, you know, and the characters and I don't know, it just became a part of me. I guess it was pre-destined and my mother thought, oh, I should go off and be a teacher or a nurse, at that time. Oh, no, either be a doctor or an actor. Actor? That is crazy. You know that's unheard of. And though my father was a minister, my father said whatever you gonna be, you just have to be the best of what that is. You decide that that is what, you know. And so very early, I guess I was encouraged that way and even when people thought that I shouldn't, I used to make up characters. Couldn't listen to blues at home, couldn't play cards at home. But from--there's a record shop in Nashville [Tennessee] called 'Randy's Record Shop' and I'm told it's still alive today. And I used to put the radio in the bed, under the thing and listen to the blues. I also, from Arkansas--Helena, Arkansas--there was the 'King Biscuit Hour' and I learned all of these blues thing--I was--this is the heart of the [Mississippi] Delta, where [HM] B.B. King is from, where Muddy Waters but you were made to feel ashamed of the blues. Now all of the big bands and the rock and roll--they didn't call it rock and roll then--what they call it--rhythm and blues. You could listen to that but not the dun dun dun--not the Muddy Waters type--not the--you know--not if you were of the quote "ilk", you know and the family background and so forth but I loved all that stuff then and remember this man Skeeter that I told you about earlier, that used to play the harmonica, at my grandmother's picnics, you know, they would call it the juking but I listened to that all then and I loved it. I loved jazz, blues. I loved all of it and I used to listen to 'Randy's Record Shop' and--what is the man--Williams from--disc jockey from Memphis, Tennessee, Nat D. Williams. Y-- Story_ID: 72662 Speaker 1: Now let me ask you- Speaker 2: You know it's just incredible, yes. Speaker 1: Did that create conflict in the family because, you know, a lot of times, one, you are- Speaker 2: Well, my siblings- Speaker 1: For your oldest--you're the oldest daughter-- Speaker 2: I'm second oldest--yeah--I'm the oldest daughter, yes- Speaker 1: --Oldest daughter--okay--and so was more expected of your oldest brother than of you? Were you typically the oldest child (simultaneous)- Speaker 2: No, no, we didn't go through that and nor did we have to pass down clothes, nor could like I seen in families, and particularly in the South, where one, an older child could tell a younger child what to do, nor--and I was very, very fortunate, my mother was always home. Now with the last three children, Marva, Tyrone and Harold, the one that's a judge [Harold Ward]--by that time--by the time they were born, my mother worked for Headstart but when we were children, she was there to, you know, take care of us and I think we didn't know--I didn't know how to do any house--I hated housework. I always had a book, she would say in a corner someplace, didn't like to cook, didn't do any of that stuff. And the only thing--and I was left-handed. I had a real complex and she would say, "Oh, no, because you look like you're nasty doing this," and it didn't make me any difference because I'd rather have a book off in a corner reading than I would stirring up the cornbread because she would mix it, mix the cornbread but that's all you had to do. My other sisters learned to cook and learned to do all that--and no. So I didn't have--I've heard people say, even my husband's family--and they're like one of the old Atlanta [Georgia] families, that they passed on clothes--we didn't have to pass on any of that--or--and we never had fights. Now that we're old, maybe gettin' ready to die, now we're fussin' and--with each other but we couldn't have fights and kids would have fights with their siblings--hmmmm hmmm, it wasn't allowed. Speaker 1: Now what was it like--? Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): --(unclear) tape change. Speaker 1: Okay. Story_ID: 72663 Speaker 1: So I was asking about being a minister's daughter? And what, you know, what are, you know, even among your siblings, what was it like, you know? Speaker 2: Well, I think that, as I stated earlier, my mother was that disciplinarian and she thought that--I mean everything was religious, religious, religious, and my aunt said to me in California, your mother was always that way, even from a child. And though my father was a minister, he understands spirituality, you know what I'm sayin', and disagreements and so forth but my mother was like straight-laced. So--but he--we couldn't play cards and I think that was my mother's doing--we couldn't play cards and we weren't supposed to dance but all of us are very, very good dancers. And my father has a small barber shop, at that time, in our town, it was Reverend Lee's Barber Shop and these ministers and people would hang out, you know, black men would hang out there. And so my father would come home and said--would say, I was just up at the barber shop and they said, in the ninth grade so and so, Ann won the dance contest in the tenth grade, eleventh grade, right on up. One of us Wards competing against each other--had won the dance contest (laughter) 'cause they used to have assembly like couple of times a week and we'd also have dance contests. And so he'd say--and so we'd just say, well we took it after you 'cause we heard, 'cause we love to dance. And bid whist--I was a bid whist champion but we couldn't play cards at home--but right around the corner, next door, and so I'd be bidding and say, look I bid and don't--'cause in my time, they play bid whist and bridge. I never played bridge but they--people play bridge right now, my brother and a lot of others--and I say I bid and leave my hands; say don't mess with--'cause my mother would say, oh, I have to put this on tape. "Queenola" (singing voice)--calling me--and I wouldn't hear her. And so somebody would say, "Your mother is calling you." I'd put my hand down and run home and, you know, see what she wanted and go back. So, we didn't--that whole thing--preacher's children--I hear more of that because when I go home, we will go to the casinos, my brothers and sisters or just before my mother passed, she would say, "Oh, your father must be turning over in his grave, to think that his children--she'd say you weren't reared this way" (laughter)--you were--and up in the casino, you know. But somehow I just think my father would say, I'm sure because I--he--they were there before he--and he said, "You all ought to stop giving your money away." That's all, you know. Speaker 1: Now, did you--did a lot of your family life evolve around the church? Speaker 2: My father didn't--until he died--just before--when he died he pastored his church at home so I can count the times that I went to my father's church. But in the church that I was reared up in which is Mount Olive Church--when I was a child if, other than my mother and a few other people said "ah-men", everybody would turn around and look. But now, I mean they singing and they, you know, they don't have no drums like they do hear at churches and things and him, you know, but, you know, it was like very, I guess--I didn't--people didn't pat and go from side to side and all--I didn't witness that until I came to Chicago [Illinois]. These people were like different. Speaker 1: You mean it was a proper Baptist? Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: And it was proper and then First Baptist is even more proper than Mount Olive and even today, it probably is and then Bethel and the CMA [sic, CME], Christian Methodist [Episcopal]--oh, yeah- Story_ID: 72664 Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah Speaker 2: Now you said you were good at, you know, speaking and that you (simultaneous)- Speaker 1: Hmmmm hmmmmm and in English. Speaker 2: In English. Okay. Speaker 1: Yeah, never good in math. Speaker 2: Same here. Speaker 1: (Laughter). Speaker 2: And when you--were there other things forming you as a young person, you know, you seem to be--were you--you seem to have had a rebellious part of you, you know, that you questioned, you were gonna--you were strong willed. Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: Strong willed. So I'm just wondering if there are other things influencing you or other people or feelings that you had, that type of thing? Speaker 1: I think that other than knowing what I wanted to do or what I, you know, and I was encouraged with that. I don't think that--oh, if was rebellious at anything--my father, I told you that all of these black farmers owned all this land, they--some of them still do. And everybody's children, and some of these kids are now doctors and head of universities and so forth, had to actually work and pick cotton on the farm. So I remember twice my father rented five acres of land because he'd say, "Y'all ain't gonna be worth nothing 'cause"--and so and so's children and these people owned big farms--they have to--the girls running the tractors could plow behind the horses or whatever and he said, "You all gonna learn how to pick cotton," and so forth because he said he had done that before. My sister would be smoking tobacco leaves. We never picked all the cotton out of the field and my father would come home from the churches 'cause he didn't pastor in Mound Bayou [Mississippi] when I was small because he wasn't educated enough, right? And we'd set the field on fire and fun and stuff like that. And we would buy lunch and a couple times, I remember a lady named, Ms.--her name was Davis, I don't remember what her--Carrie Davis? Carrie Davis. I remember she had these wonderful, wonderful, wonderful antiques in her house. Now I know they're antiques and she told my mother, she said, "Ward, if you let those lazy kids go with me," put 'em on the truck because black and white farmers would have these trucks that these people would go and pick or chop cotton. She'd say, "You all just raising them up to do nothing," right? And so she'd say just put 'em with me. So for one week, this woman put us--my mother consent--let Ms. Davis--what--go on--she'd have to get up like six o'clock in the morning, whatever, and with these--whatever--the bandanas and the straw hat on and everything. And like we hated this lady 'cause she went to our church too. She was all like a evil--yeah, "They just raising y'all up to be nothing and your daddy take care"--don't you know your daddy work hard? Yeah. Well she took us to the field and you'd have this lunch and everybody had a big lunch. That's all I did so she brought us back. And she say, "Look you take your children, honey. They ain't gonna be nothing, they ain't nothing now. They ain't gonna be"--I said no, not when it comes to pickin' no cotton (laughter)--ain't chopping no cotton. But my--we didn't have to and my father didn't make us and I remember that--where my brothers, one young brother that's the judge today, where his house is sitting right this moment, my father rented five acres--this used to be farmland that they have had--have all houses now. We didn't even--didn't ever pick the cotton up--whatever. And in my town, that's the other thing, they had, I think it was five [cotton] gins but I know three gins that black people owned these gins and they did white people and black people's cotton. And it be--just lined the places--were lined up with people for miles to miles tryin' to get in to these gins. And one gin, maybe that shell is there near one brother's house and maybe a shell of a gin but I'm sure that Milbourn [J. Crowe] has all this. But it's just incredible because in this guy's Ph.D., I'm skipping about now tellin' you, he wrote about the best cotton grown in America was once grown in this town of Mound Bayou [Mississippi]. And they had a Philadelphia Exposition [1876], I think, it's St. Louis Exposition [1904] and the two things that were really outstanding that they had was the levy, the Mississippi levy, 'cause Isaac T. Montgomery, I guess, or Benjamin Green--one of them helped to do the architect for that. And the cotton, they raised the best cotton. That's in one of the, maybe one of the research books that I was looking in at Syracuse University [New York]. So, like the one thing that I feel good about now and I felt good about then, I didn't know how fortunate we were is that you always felt that you could and should do and you felt good about yourself. You didn't feel inferior to nothing or nobody. Story_ID: 72665 Speaker 1: Now you--what other things were forming you as a young though? That's what I want to get back. Speaker 2: I don't know, other than that--other--'cause other than the people around me, both my church and at school, that was everything, I guess that was my world. It was a--when people say Mound Bayou [Mississippi], if I-[HM Pervis] Spann out at V-O-N [WVON Chicago] will say now, he'll say, "Oh, yeah, Val is from that little town." We were in one sense isolated. In another sense, we weren't because we had to go to these things outside and play basketball, football or oratorical contest 'cause that was really big then--oratoricals, that I'm telling you about, and compete with other young people but, when other people had to--in Clarksdale, Mississippi, which has a black mayor now--Aaron Henry was mayor. You've heard of Aaron Henry. If people-they [black residents] had to be back in Clarksdale before twelve o'clock at night. They could come to Mound Bayou [Mississippi] and see the animals and swim 'cause we had a pool and everything but they had to be back in their towns. And if they weren't back in these white towns by twelve o'clock at night, they couldn't come home. So a lot of people had said, we didn't know what that was. And as early as I can remember, kids had cars or you drove--I mean kids are still driving now and then--now it's thirteen and fourteen. But you just did. Now I know that were just riding right around through this little (laughter), you know, and through my friends on their farms and so forth. But it was special, it was different and I didn't know that that was--I thought that that everybody had that kind of life. I thought until I, you know- Story_ID: 72666 Speaker 1: So when you graduated, you said that what? Speaker 2: When I graduated [Mound Bayou High School 1950], I got a scholarship to Tougaloo College in Tougaloo, Mississippi. I got one for leadership and one for oratorical. And this I don't like to talk about because I been to Chicago [Illinois] in '47 [1947], my mother had brought me on vacation to visit this aunt I'm tellin' you about and--I might as well put this on here--it's something I really don't like to talk about and I really--and I guess one of the reasons I haven't written a book is a fella I used to go with--brother, we just went for a ride with two other friends, molested me. And I got pregnant and that was like--for my mother--that was like, oh my God--and I really--this is the first time I've ever talked about it to anybody--I mean outside--on screen or talked about it historically. I--when my mother found out then that was the first time I'd had a relationship--he took advantage of me and I got pregnant so instead of her--and thank God she didn't now--have an abortion, that was just out because several of my friends and my best friend, who is Dr. Alma George, was the first black woman president of the medical association in Detroit [Michigan], somebody else you should interview. Her father, Dr. P.N. George was my, my doctor and she could have had an abortion but that was--my mother wouldn't hear of that. So my mother sent me North to Chicago [Illinois] and all my friends went off to school and for about--oh boy--ten years of my life or longer--oh much longer than that, my mother never ever allowed that, until maybe--and I don't know if she ever got over it. She always threw that up to me and I remember Mrs. George and several people sayin', "We can give her an abortion or some--you know--she can go away." Oh, that was unheard of and thank God because Babitu wouldn't be here--now when I think about it. Story_ID: 72667 Speaker 1: And then I came to--I stayed in Chicago [Illinois] and unfortunately I got married to John Gray--that I don't like to talk about either but I'm tellin' you now and we were totally--two totally different people. And, had three children after that by him and in between these children, was going to [Wilson Junior] college [Chicago, Illinois] and he would tear my books so I want to recite he would think, pay me some attention and this sort of thing and he physically abused me. He was--we're from two different backgrounds but I'm supposed to be now ashamed and an outcast for what--you know, having gotten pregnant. And all my friends were going off to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] or, and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Howard [University, Washington D.C.] and so forth and Tougaloo [College, Mississippi] and Talladega [College, Alabama] and so forth. And I really felt really bad. And I guess--but I said to myself and, and my mother--I guess I'll show 'cause I'm still gonna be the actress. And I'm still gonna do what I want to do or what I believe and live. And I remember afterwards she--I guess she liked this John Gray because he provided physical things. And by the way, I'm gonna provide you a picture of the two of us. I just didn't have time to go by Bukai's (ph.) and get it. Anyway he physically abused me and I, you know, and I--touched me, hit me, you know. And I left him and my mother said, "Well, after all, he's providing everything and he's a hard-working man and you have good clothes and you go to the best of places." "Oh, yeah, but we're two different people. We don't see eye to eye." "Yeah, but now you have these children." Well, I had these children one behind--'cause I didn't know anything else. This was totally new and so I grew up with my children and I guess they became my theater 'cause I used to do these lil' characteristics, even when they were babies. And in between going to--it was Wilson Jr. College then. In between being pregnant and so forth and then I can't--I don't know how early that I met [HM] Margaret Burroughs and Gwendolyn Brooks and Conrad Rivers and other people. But anyway when I left this man, I started going around the people that I, you know, that were doing the things I would hear about and in the churches, people would--and I'd say, can I recite? And they'd say, can you recite? Yeah, and I'd do two seconds of [William Cullen Bryant] 'Thanatopsis' and then I'd do the creation or do something else. And--'cause nobody wanted to hear--this was prior to the Civil Rights movement--nobody wanted to hear this black stuff, right? But then the Civil Rights Movement moved around to me. And by that time, you know, I'm separated, totally separated and soon I met my husband, Francis, who- Speaker 2: Now what time period are we talking about? What year did you come here to Chicago- Speaker 1: The first time I came on vacation- Speaker 2: Was '47 [1947]. Speaker 1: Yeah, was '47 [1947] but when I came here to live was '51 [1951]. Speaker 2: Okay, and so- Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: We're talking about '51 [1951] to what period? Speaker 1: Up until, I think I was married to--'51 [1951], '52 [1952]-3-4-5--this is the part of my life that I block--blink out, maybe like '50 [1950] 'cause I think I stayed married to him almost seven years but I don't even deal with that. Speaker 2: (Simultaneous). Speaker 1: And if it wasn't for what this is, I wouldn't--yeah. Speaker 2: Fifty-one [1951] to '58 [1958]. Speaker 1: Yeah. I don't think I stayed with him to '58 [1958], maybe '57 [1957]. Speaker 2: And then what--is that when you saying you met- Speaker 1: Oh, no, I didn't meet [HM] Francis [Ward] until the death of Malcolm [X]. Speaker 2: So what year is that? That's 1960- Speaker 1: What--'65 [1965]? '64 [1964] or 65 [1965]. Because his first job at a newspaper, it was Ebony and Jet. Ebony, at that time, was at 1820 South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], instead of 820 and they sent him out to cover my performance and that's how I met him. Story_ID: 72668 Speaker 1: And-- Now what were you performing then? Speaker 2: What I was--I don't remember what pieces I was--when I met him but I remember it was--I need to go to the library and find out or to the thing in New York 'cause they would have it. But I was performing, he can tell you, but I remember our first date and what that, too. The Frank London Brown [Negro] History Club [Chicago, Illinois] and if you haven't gotten anybody down from that, if you haven't heard about it, you need to hear about Frank London Brown and the Frank London and Brown [Negro] History Club. And our first day, he came out and got the story. I was living in Hyde Park, Kenwood [Chicago, Illinois]. And he--afterwards--and he would--I had him for dinner 'cause he had--wanted to make several appointments and I was busy. I had the performance. I was working. I was, what do you call it, catering manager at the South Mar (ph.) but I was still doing these things and taking care of my kids. And he--I invited him for dinner and he came over and had dinner and he said, oh, this is wonderful. And he said, "What time can you--will your husband be home so I can intro--so I can interview." I said, "I have no husband," hmmmm, so that was the start of it. And I invited him and he said, well, I've just moved to--from New York--to Chicago [Illinois] and, you know, he was--at that time, he was with Jet. And I said well--and we talked and we had some of the same things in common. So I said you must be interesting if you don't know any people. I said you must come with me to the--'cause I belonged to the Frank London Brown [Negro] History Club. And I think I brought a brochure from them--one of that--thing that when I was telling you about [HM] John Hope Franklin. And so he said, sure. And so we started attending those meetings and we started dating and, you know, Cinderella story after that--happy ever after- Speaker 1: I wanted to talk to you about Francis. Speaker 2: His intellect and he was a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful gentleman. I used to go to the concerts at Grant, Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois] and take the children. And he--when we started dating, we must have dated like a couple of months and he would come over and take the boys to the ball game. He'd go with us to the Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois] and we start liking the same things. And both of us were--he really is a historian and he was well respected there and so we didn't date--I don't guess almost a year, you know, before we got engaged. And it was just wonderful, just every, just everything about him. But we had so much in common and I was an activist, you know, and he wanted--he didn't know people in Chicago [Illinois] so, you know, I introduced him to people and places and things. And the things that he liked 'cause see he doesn't like all the things that I like, all the historical things and being active, yes. Story_ID: 72669 Speaker 1: Now how, when you say you were an activist, when did that start? Speaker 2: I guess now, when I think about it, all of my life because these people in Mound--that was just part of- Speaker 1: But when did it start here in Chicago [Illinois]? Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know, Julie[anna Richardson], because I used to go to not Olivet--what is this church, I think it's down on Indiana [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois]; used to go to the Packing House to things. Long before then quote Civil Rights Movement in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and free seven [Title VII of the Civil Rights Act]--let me see, founded Kuumba in '67 [1967], I used to have a group, Artists for Freedom that I founded but that was during the Civil Rights Movement and I--(simultaneous)- Speaker 1: But what year were Artists for Freedom formed? Speaker 2: Artists for Freedom--must have been '65[1965] or '66 [1966]. I need to find out because you will not believe the two Shaw brothers was in Artists for Freedom. And I'm talkin' about--oh, I shouldn't say that on the tape--that's not to be printed--that's not to be--please don't put that on there. Speaker 1: Okay, stop--(simultaneous)- Speaker 2: I mean cut that out. Speaker 1: Stop tape, okay. Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: Now even when you were married to [John] Gray? Speaker 2: Oh, no, not when I was married to him. Oh, God, he used to tear up my books. Story_ID: 72670 Speaker 1: Okay but when did you start performing? Speaker 2: Even then, I might have performed at some churches, you know, just reading whenever they had programs or something but I have to find out 'cause that's part of my life that I blocked out, Julie[anna Richardson], that I don't usually talk about- Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: --period. Speaker 1: Okay, but what was Chicago [Illinois]--that's all I'm saying is--when, you know, what was, what was, when did you (simultaneous)- Speaker 2: But I'm tellin' you, there were things, there were places like the South Side Art Center [Chicago, Illinois]. I don't know how early or when I found out about that. Or the Packing House was at 40 something and Wabash [Chicago, Illinois] and a church down on Indiana [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois]. I don't where that church--you know, there were people before the Civil Rights Move--they were doing things. They were, you know, and those things that I went--the things that encouraged me, I don't know when the first date I met Gwendolyn Brooks. I been tryin' to think of that but I do know real early I used to go to her house. There was Studs Terkel, Bob [Robert] Cromie at the Chicago Tribune, his wife, Alice, Studs [Terkel]'s wife. Oh, I could just name other people and it was only about maybe four or five people that's my age and [HM] Margaret Burroughs and Charles Burroughs and other people. So that's in the '60s [1960s], early '60s 1960s. I can't, you know, but, and I need to--'cause I got photographs and Gwen's got photographs and she's got poems and stuff, things. And I know that, when I was in this group, "To Make a Poet Black," that was before the Civil Rights Movement, Conrad K. Rivers, I'm sure somebody else has talked about him. Oh, they haven't? Milton Lamb and Connor played the guitar. There were people like Odetta coming in, so I guess the things that I liked, I'm beginning to--but I can't tell you--I can find out very easily when the date for--To Make a Poet Black because Dorothy--what's her name--Connors--I can find out some of these things. Speaker 1: What was the group? What were the--what were the, what were the- Speaker 2: (simultaneous)- Speaker 1: "To Make a Poet Black" was the group. Speaker 2: No, what was the, what was the dynamics of even the group (simultaneous)- Speaker 1: We just did black--the works of black writers. Speaker 2: Okay, and how was that--(simultaneous) Speaker 1: We were doing like renaissance writers and a lot of things that I knew 'cause I think this woman, Claudia McCormick--Chuck will tell you, that used to be with Chuck at the--67th Street, the [Jane Addams] Hull House [Chicago, Illinois]. I think maybe she used to be in that group. But anyway, I became a part of that group. I don't know, I think she used to--I think maybe she was in it any longer or got sick or something and became--and that was two--this guitar player and two men. And we used to do all of the renaissance and "Dream Deferred" [Harlem, by Langston Hughes] and all that stuff because that was stuff I knew and so it was easy for me to--I don't know how I became--how I met them or when. Speaker 2: So were you--what was this group--would you perform around at different places? Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: Would you get together and have (simultaneous)- Speaker 1: Churches, South Side Art Center and Gwendolyn [Brooks], at that time, had parties, like I used to have parties too. [HM] Margaret Burroughs at 3806 South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] would--I guess these people were all in--Gwen's husband, Henry Blakely, they were always like maybe radical before that and they might have been--some of them might have been quote socialist and the thing before but this wasn't new, they were already doing these things. And so the Civil Rights Movement but, at that time, it was like black and white, all these people were together, you know. And what's the name of that folk singing group on the North Side? I think it's still there isn't it? Don't they have a school? Speaker 2: Old Town School (simultaneous)- Speaker 1: Old Time School of [Folk Music, Chicago, Illinois]--those people, yeah. Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: Second City was founded, after I--maybe around--little before I founded Kuumba 'cause Felton Perry, Val Ward and who else? Second City, oh, you really taking me back. Speaker 2: Was there a prelude to- Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Gotta change tape. Speaker 2: Was a prelude to what? Speaker 1: Well, I was just wondering if there was-- Story_ID: 72671 Speaker 1: --much, I mean you asking me so- Speaker 2: But that's the purpose of that (simultaneous)- Speaker 1: I know it. Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: A lot of this I have written down in notes but- Speaker 2: --But it's okay though if you don't remember specific dates. Don't get caught up (simultaneous)- Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: --in that--(simultaneous)- Speaker 1: But during that time, it was so wonderful. But that conference was the things that turned Gwendolyn [Brooks] totally--I hate to say her blackness -'cause her writings have always been black but, as an activist, before Gwendolyn [Brooks] (simultaneous)- Speaker 2: What conference? Speaker 1: What? Speaker 2: The conference in Nashville [Tennessee]. John O. [Oliver] Killens put it together [National Black Writers Conference, Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee, 1986]. Then we heard the 'Thunder of Mississippi'--No, he didn't write 'Mississippi Delta'. Then we heard the 'Thunder', 'Black Man's Burden'--that John O. [Oliver] Killens, right? And he had all these people and 'Baraka' and she-Gwendolyn [Brooks] went there and she heard this and afterwards, we had a big--what did we have here--was it the Afro Arts Theater Conference--what did we have? Something he had--but anyway, she came back on fire. She started her writer's workshop [Conference and Center for Black Literature and Creative Writing], which had Don Lee, Johari Amini who is Joy Lattimore at that time. People started changing their names and so forth, much later on, maybe like '69 [1969] or '70 [1970]. But--oh and it had the Obasi Writer's Workshop [Chuck Obasi] and it had Walter Bradford and other people and then the A-A-A-C [African American Advisory Council], A-A-C-M [Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians] started with Muhal [Richard] Abrams. We used to, oh God, this is wonderful but I think this--by now this must be '69 [1969] or '68 [1968]. I don't know 'cause Kuumba's first--and [HM] Phil[ip] Cohran was at the Afro Arts Theater at 39th and Oakwood [Chicago, Illinois]. We did--'69 [1969], I think we did "To Gwen[dolyn Brooks] With Love". We did a live performance, the people came from all around the country, some of the same people that were at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], all around the country to do this--to honor Gwendolyn Brooks, while she lived. And we did it--Gwendolyn [Brooks] had had--I don't know if it was James Baldwin or--what's the man wrote the book with--St. Clair Drake ['Black Metropolis'], [HM] Robert Hayden? No, but I knew [HM] Robert Hayden. She'd had a party for him 'cause we had a party at our house too. And I was going home that night, before we used to stay there all night long 'til two and three and four o'clock in the morning. We'd have dinner and she had a little bitty house at 7428 Evans [Chicago, Illinois] and we used to just sit there and people read their manuscript of whoever was coming in town and James Baldwin or whomever. And then I thought, going home, it was day breaking and I thought, "Why aren't we honoring Gwendolyn Brooks?" And instead of going home, going to bed, I got home and I started calling people. [HM] Francis [Ward] didn't go that night and I started calling people. I called John O. [Oliver] Killens. I called John Henrik Clarke, different people from all (unclear). If I get together and put together an anthology, can we say to Gwen[dolyn Brooks] while she's alive we love it? Yes. Started calling people, [HM] Sonia Sanchez, at that time, everybody was plugged into everybody anyway 'cause it's heyday now so maybe that's '69 [1969]. That was Kuumba's first liberation award. Story_ID: 72672 Speaker 1: But I want to go back (simultaneous)- Speaker 2: Okay, but please let's talk about that part. Speaker 1: Okay, but no, we have to go back (simultaneous)- Speaker 2: Okay, but you can take me back- Speaker 1: How--why did even Kuumba [Theater] get started? Speaker 2: Kuumba got started--I had started the Artists for Freedom, which was--I remember two Shaw [brothers] were in it. There's a sister that's now at Chicago State [University, Illinois], who we called a cook at the time but her name was something else and then she was a singer--Tennyson Stevenson [sic, Stevens] and Rhetta Hughes who was in [HM Melvin] Van Peebles, 'Sweet Sweetback'. Do you remember that? Okay, all of us were together and we were raising money by then for the civil rights movement, Speaker 1: But why, why did you even start Artists for (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: -for Freedom? Speaker 1: Right? Speaker 2: For that reason, for liberation, to--'cause I couldn't do the non-violent stuff that people were doing. Speaker 1: Why? Speaker 2: I, I didn't believe in it. Speaker 1: Okay, but tell, tell me why (simultaneous). Speaker 2: No, I just never believed in it but I figured that, as an artist, the same as people say about religion, that this is my religion and this is what I know I can do and so I can raise money or I can help be on the rally. And I was on many rallies with [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], Mahalia Jackson, all of these people--I was doing all that stuff individually. So then I pulled Artists for Freedom together and I think the Mississippi Freedom Party had started and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] write and they needed money, right? And so we putting 'em together to raise money and--Bootsie--Ben Fernandez --have you hear of Ben Fernandez? Okay, I'm trying to think of the people that were in the group. We started that group. And Tennyson [Stevens] and Rhetta [Hughes] were like really professional. And Ahmad Jamal used to have a place across the place over there and they played there and played at these different places. And we would put together these things and we started the Artists for Freedom. So anyway that broke up because Rhetta [Hughes] and Tennyson [Stevens] went to New York and then I started Kuumba. It must have been the latter part of '67 [1967] or '68 [1968]. I started--to continue to raise money and we gave money to--it was a black women's committee over on--oh, I don't know what street it was, Oak- Lake Park or one of them. Provident Hospital [Chicago, Illinois], the institute of the black world and Margaret was trying to get that building where DuSable Museum [of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] is today. She was at 3806 in her basement south Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois]. And that's what Kuumba--I probably--we probably raising ten and fifteen dollars a night but we divided--in the black institute of the world--in Atlanta, started by [HM] Vincent Harding, [HM] Lerone Bennett, what's his name, Howard, that heads the thing in New York? Speaker 1: [HM Howard] Dodson. Speaker 2: [HM Howard] Dodson. [HM] Vincent Harding and others, [HM] Bernice [Johnson] Reagon 'cause even though we were local, you were national because various things, I'm in Atlanta [Georgia], Detroit [Michigan], or what have you. Story_ID: 72673 Speaker 1: And Kuumba founded it--was founded around the concept that--and when we first started, it was writers, musicians and it was at my house at 1712 East 84th Place [Chicago, Illinois]. And the writers would be upstairs and dramatists would be in the living room and we started that way. And then we were founded around the concept of, if the people didn't go to the theater, we would take the art to them and Gwendolyn [Brooks] has said, with an autobiographer and several times that, that was really the highlight of Kuumba's art because we took art everywhere, in the taverns, on the street corners. We were on the street corners up until Mayor [Richard J.] Daley announced that, and this was up--I'm really skipping way past now-[Martin Luther] King was killed--he said, oh, I think--I don't know how many black people congregate at one time would be against the law and they would be arrested but we would still--I remember we were at 16th and Holman [Chicago, Illinois]. Had a performance coming up, he announced that on like a Friday or something. On a Saturday, we went to the West Side 'cause on that Sunday, because we had a performance at 16th and Holman for the, let me see, Rangers were on the South Side, the Vice Lords, I guess, was on the West Side and I was--all these gangs, I could go and perform any place in the city. And so we were performing and time we started performing, the police came up, right? And so we just went right into the church ritual and I brought some of those pictures with me to show you today. Or, and I have to skip to tell you this--I'm skipping another time (simultaneous). Speaker 2: Don't skip. Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, remind me, please ask me about--(simultaneous) Speaker 2: Don't worry, we're not gonna (simultaneous)- Speaker 1: --something else, okay. Speaker 2: No, but this is thing, Val, don't refer to photos and things like the text and--what was actually happening here in Chicago [Illinois], what was the environment and what was happening around the country? That's what I want. Speaker 1: Oh, but--it was what was happening--it was happening around the country but it was really happening in Chicago [Illinois]. And I'm gonna do a book, I think I told you on black art in Chicago [Illinois]. I'm tellin' you that (simultaneous). Speaker 2: No, but--(simultaneous) Speaker 1: No, but we're not on now, are we? Speaker 2: Yes, we are. Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know we were on. Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: I thought we were just talkin'. I'm sorry. I didn't know we were back on. Speaker 2: Okay. Story_ID: 72674 Speaker 1: Okay, but, I mean the whole country, in terms of art, there were, there was in Chicago [Illinois], there was always [Jane Addams] Hull House prior but that was a social center at 67th Street. And they did everything. I just wanted to do the works of black writers because that's what I had known and had done individually. And I wanted to interpret, to be the voice of those people that were not heard. And I wanted to raise money for those institutions that I told you and we did. And maybe like two years after we were formed; oh, I can't remember the young man that named Kuumba, Kuumba but Coringa had just come out with the 'Seven Principles' and we named it Kuumba, I don't guess it had been out six, maybe six months but we chose the name Kuumba, meaning creativity, meaning "clean up, create and build"--our motto was "clean up, create and build" and, but, make anew. And wanted to take art to the people but the country was--N-E-C [Negro Ensemble Company] was in New York. [HM] Barbara Ann Teer was also in New York. New Lafayette [Theater] was in New York, New York. Dashiki was in New Orleans [Louisiana]. Oh, I can't think of the name of--Ron Milton and [HM] Woodie King had not gone to New York. [HM] Woodie [King] had--this was prior to [HM] Woodie [King] going to New York. I forget the--New Concept was in Detroit [Michigan]. Buddy Butler, maybe Buddy was in Washington state at the time or Minnesota and there was a theater--and Free Southern [Theater] was also in the South. They were going all over the South, but they were headed--I mean they were located in New Orleans [Lousiana]. And, oh, God, later on, Bea Richardson, other people became a part of that theater in L A. [Los Angeles, California]. But all of were like plugging in to each other and it was really a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time because then people like [Yolanda Cornelia] [HM] Nikki Giovanni, [HM] Sonia Sanchez, Sonia was teaching out in California at the time. Later on, she came East and she and [married] Etheridge Knight. Etheridge was in Indianapolis [Indiana], Mari Evans in Indianapolis but we were coming together 'cause there were art conferences and writers and people were publishing themselves besides Dudley Randall in Detroit [Michigan]. Oh, what is the name of Dudley's press [Broadside Press]? Was the first maybe to publish [HM] Haki [Madhubuti] and these and [HM] Nikki [Giovanni] and [HM] Sonia [Sanchez]; otherwise they were publishing themselves. They were just writing and publishing and people were-[HM] Haki [Madhubuti] was selling his stuff on street corners. [HM] Nikki [Giovanni] and [HM] Sonia [Sanchez] and everybody--was a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time for art because people wanted to say what they wanted to say. Then SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], Bob Lucas and people like that and Georgia English, [HM] Lu[trelle] Palmer's ex-wife, as all in (unclear), Lawrence Landry--was a--I mean Chicago [Illinois] was alive and a lot was going on but people--even though people belonged to their individual organizations and even belonged to--like people belonged to Kuumba also belonged to Obasi Writers [Workshop], also belonged to Gwendolyn Brooks, also belonged to A-A-C-M [Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians] or also was a part of [HM] Phil[ip] Cohran's workshop at the Oakland--at the theater--Afro Arts Theater, at 39th and Oakwood [Chicago, Illinois]. And nobody was competing, you know, people were just doing whatever's necessary. And--what's the name--did the wall--they did the wall walker--Paul? I think his name is Paul Walker, that came out of that whole concept of that time and while they were painting their original wall at 43rd, I think in Indiana, 43rd and Indiana or Calumet [Chicago, Illinois]? Gwendolyn Brooks and Val Ward and [Chuck] Obasi [Writers Workshop] and everybody was reading [HM] Jeff Donaldson and people were painting and A-A-C-M [Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians], people were playing and [HM] Phil[ip] Cohran was playing. I mean we just did it. We were doing it, it was like probably some of the most wonderful, creative time of my life because it was wonderful and people talked to each other and people shared, you know, and it really wasn't about competing or you belonging to this group or that group. Story_ID: 72675 Speaker 1: And then another really big thing happened, Reverend [Albert] Cleage who is now in Atlanta [Georgia], had the Shrine of the [Black] Madonna in Detroit [Michigan]. He was a Methodist minister but he was coming out of the Methodist church starting whatever, I guess you call it a nationalist now. And people like Aaron Henry and the brothers--Aaron Henry was one of the lawyers in Detroit [Michigan]. And his brother--I forget all of them--his brother, oh, any of those people--I know all of those people. And I've got photographs, I'm not supposed to talk about that now but I've got, from that time, and I remember the Shrine of the [Black] Madonna that day Lukman [X], man that used to be here, used to always be one of Malcolm [X]'s whatever--helpers was there, Sister Betty Shabazz, that's when we became very close friends. These two brothers that now have, I guess one brother is in some part of Georgia and the other is in some part of Mississippi. They gonna start African villages, where their families were as white as anybody could look, but anyway, they gonna start all this and had the believed in this polygamy and a lot of us never, never ever believed in all this polygamy. All that came out of that and [Bishop Albert] Cleage's church named his church the Shrine of the [Black] Madonna. They're now really big in Atlanta [Georgia] and his daughter is the playwright--what's her name--Cleage? Speaker 2: (unclear) Cleage. Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: [HM] Pearl Cleage. Speaker 1: [HM] Pearl Cleage is his daughter. And it was like--and all of us were together. I remember that [HM] Nikki [Giovanni] had a little Volkswagen, so did Sonia and we drove to Detroit [Michigan] and I don't know how many people we took but David Lawrence, you must have heard of David-and David was a wonderful, wonderful writer, right, wrote also of Ebony magazine. We went there and coming back, we were almost killed. We were--ran off the highway and John O. [Oliver] Killens was coming back to Chicago [Illinois] with us because John is first cousin to [HM] Gus Savage and John had just written--wasn't then we heard 'Thunder'; 'Cotillion' and he read the galleys at my house, right? I mean all these things were happening. [HM] Nikki [Giovanni] was like staying at our house, they weren't big names then. They were like just, you know, wonderful people. Etheridge [Knight] had just gotten out of prison, he went back to prison after that but we met him through Mari Evans who was in Indianapolis and just so many people just in--by that time--the world was coming--becoming really, really small and Hoyt, [HM] Margaret [Burroughs] always-[HM] Margaret Burroughs always would take these trips to Africa and would talk about Africa and I did what--shall I tell her children but Hoyt Fuller, who was so instrumental in everything, particularly publishing, because at that time, it was Negro Digest before Black World, we founded Black World and that was founded at Kuumba. In Negro Digest--but it was Negro Digest and all these writers would come to town and we would--he would bring them in and then he would expose these different people and [HM] Lerone [Bennett], at that time, was an activist, and oh, my God, so much was going on every day of the week, day and night and people were creating and we would take the newspaper, the [Chicago] Tribune and the today's, I mean [Chicago] Tribune--what was that Newsday--what was that other paper that the [Chicago] Daily News? Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Speaker 1: [Chicago] Daily News, and [Chicago] Sun Times, this was before my husband worked the [Chicago] Sun Times 'cause after he left, Ebony and went to [Chicago] Sun Times. We would take them along with [Langston Hughes] 'Black Metropolis' or any other book and put together a play and make a play out of that. We created, we did, I guess two years of first, our first play was 'Contribution' by Ted Shine, formal play. Before that, we used to just take from the newspapers or what was happening nationally or otherwise or history books and create. We would have workshops and we talk of--it was originally founded as Kuumba Workshop and we would take and discuss what was going on and out of that, create productions. It was- Story_ID: 72676 Speaker 1: So this was really what you were doing--what was everyone was involved in with was really theater--well in the case of theater, theater of the people or arts of the people period. And so what you describe as something that's very sort of free flowing and (simultaneous)- Speaker 2: It had structure but it was free flowing- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--it was organic. Speaker 2: Yeah. Matter of fact, Organic Theater was founded at around that time in Victory Gardens and, yeah, a few more, yeah. Speaker 1: And so there's a lot of energy flowing, right? (Simultaneous). Speaker 2: Yes, yes. Speaker 1: --it's a very creative period. Speaker 2: Oh, one of the most creative periods of my life, yes. Speaker 1: And what were you trying to, you know, what was--'cause you said that we were developing our theater around issues of the community. Speaker 2: Not just the community, but what affected our lives. And what had been left out of the history books and today even the reason people say, "My God, with all of your talent, why don't you get out of the black stuff." I say but if I am not these voices and if I don't cheer these voices and these sounds and these people, they will never be heard, right? And so that's how and why--and to me it was just natural and normal because I'd done this all my life, you know, I'd been exposed to this. And it was just enhancing it or, you know, like putting on your clothes and puttin' on a coat on what you were doing. Speaker 1: And do you--did you--what was the community tellin' you, what issues were you trying, you know, that--what was--what did you feel was being left out of the--you know, what were you discovering that had been left out of the history books and what were the things that you were trying to educate or- Speaker 2: The works of Langston Hughes, [W.E.B.] DuBois, Richard Wright or Gwendolyn Brooks or [HM] Margaret Burroughs or- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--well, some of these were contemporaries though. Speaker 2: Yeah, but even I did post-renaissance, from Phyllis Wheatley because I always read and I do now and I still--and that's what I'm doing at Yale [University, Connecticut] and the places today because it still isn't as it should be and even if it's as it should be, some of these voices and some of those people--some of the people that Langston Hughes spent all of his time writing about, a lot of black, particularly black kids, because a lot of white students will know more about this than black students. And so I share this because it's--I believe that art should entertain as well as educate. Matter of fact, later on, we should talk about Kuumba's twelve principles or I should give them to you. And--'cause it took like six weeks to form them but that was one of the things that I believed and I still believe in, that yes, whether it's satire, comedy or serious drama, whatever, it should educate, as well as entertain. Story_ID: 72677 Speaker 1: So what were Kuumba's twelve principles? Speaker 2: Oh, now you would ask me. One is not to--enough to show a black reality, that we must tell why our art exists, its effect or offer some necessary alternatives. Meaning that, for instance, during black exploitation films, lot of people say, oh, '[Sweet] Sweetback' is revolutionary and we say yeah, really, what is revolution and what is revolutionary about it? Let's look at it. Kuumba had a newspaper. We had forums and we would analyze what made--how was it revolutionary and somebody running from here to Mexico or wherever and having a young boy exposed to older women, how is that revolutionary? What do you mean by revolutionary? So those are the serious things we did. And we brought in--we had panels, up to the time of Colored Girls with the sociologists and psychologists. We'd bring people from Lake Forest [College, Illinois], Northwestern [University, Illinois], [HM] Vernon Jarrett and oooh, I'm sure that you've--Herbert Martin, who's also from Mound Bayou [Mississippi]. You know, and we would talk about it and analyze it and then bring in the playwrights and bring in the people, you know, and that's why we had discussions. But we did, you know, plays that were like [Useni Eugene Perkins] 'The Image Makers'. Their reviews--I was just looking over some reviews at the [Chicago] Tribune did twelve pages, way back when and that was about black exploitation films. So it was not enough to talk about 'em because people would say, oh, these militants--or these troublemakers and I--my house was fire bombed. Oh Jesus, there's all kind of stuff and because of this art, right? And Chicago [Illinois] had a red squad and [HM] Margaret Burroughs said, will you and [HM] Francis [Ward] sign this thing with me 'cause I'm getting dossiers--you getting' what? Dossiers, so she got 'em. And what would it have? I was at the Packing House [Chicago, Illinois] and Stokely [Carmichael, Kwame Ture] would say, I said, for instance, "What shall I tell my children who's black," and I was wearing whatever a description of that on there, and if the three of us, Paul, you and Paul--I mean other people were there--they would just cross out, and you tryin' to think, who else was there and that's all you were doing, creating art. And there were as many whites involved as there were blacks in terms of, you know, the struggle of our people coming, you know, getting involved and so forth. Story_ID: 72678 Speaker 1: So this really--when you say that you--well, let me ask--when--in Kuumba, because we're trying to really capture the history of Kuumba with this also. When Kuumba started, it started in your home or did it start (simultaneous). Speaker 2: Seventeen twelve (1712) East 84th Place [Chicago, Illinois]. Speaker 1: And for how long was it operating out of our house? Speaker 2: I don't know, maybe about six months. I have all that written down and I'll give you a history book up to twenty-five years. My husband did it. But I know our first home away from home was the South Side Art Center, at 3831 South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois]. Speaker 1: So what were some of the plays or things that you did during that period? Speaker 2: I told you the first formal play we did was 'Contribution' by Ted Shine and after that, we did, oh, God, so many others; I mean regular plays. We never did like 'Raisin In The Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] or anything like that but mostly we would create out of Ritual 'cause, you know, it's mostly reading and talking and putting the portrait together and making that portrait tell a story of prose and history or whatever we read in the paper that way, creating. Speaker 1: So you were, you were--pause? (unclear). Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Yes. Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I hate to do this. It's so dark on this (simultaneous). Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Can I have you sit back please? Speaker 1: I'm sorry. Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Yes Speaker 2: I'm sorry. Speaker 1: Okay. It was so, so you were less about really doing let's say traditional works like 'Raisin In The Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] and more about creating--Ritual? Speaker 2: That--(simultaneous) Speaker 1: And can you tell me about ritual--(simultaneous) Speaker 2: I knew, yeah, we were founded during Ritual because a lot was going on, a lot was happening and so we were re-creating a lot of what contemporary--what was happening in the papers today--putting that together with Langston Hughes or Gwendolyn Brooks, DeWitt Williams or [HM] Margaret Burroughs--for Margaret Walker's 'For My People', things that I had done and she had written in 1942. And a lot of people just didn't know and I mean even teachers didn't know and so once people would hear us, it's quality. There were quality singers, quality everything, you know. And, if you give us a second, we would take, you know, the rest of it and then people started inviting us. I can tell you that after [Martin Luther] King was killed, and I know I'm not supposed to tell you, I'm supposed to show you some films but I'm going to talk about [HM] Wayne Watson, whose now chancellor. He was a student at Northwestern University [Illinois] and there was a lady that's now--she's got two Ph.D.'s, her name was Sondra Malone, she was [Ngena] Kimi Moyo. She was married to Kofi, who does the A Black Man--what--dinner, cooking or whatever they do ['Real Men Cook']. She was married to him. I introduced them, as a matter of fact. We used to go to taverns, go to street corners and do these Rituals that I'm tellin' you about, prose and poetry and whatever's happening. So we created this Ritual. This was after [Martin Luther] King was born--killed. And [HM] Haki [Madhubuti] has a poem, oh, gee, I can't even think of the name of the poem right at this time but there's a girl that's now in Hollywood, Matrise (ph.) used to come running in from outside with her hair standing on top of her head and with this house dress on and one shoe in her hand and said oh, my God, they killed him, they killed him and cried screaming so everybody jumps up and [HM] Wayne Watson, Chancellor Watson now, I guess, he is. And--oh, what was his name, was president of Kennedy King [College, Illinois] before [HM] Wayne [Watson]--Pace--his people are from Mound Bayou [Mississippi], too, Pace. Anyway were in the audience. So was Mary and Vince 'cause they've always been on the board. So was Mari Evans, that night, her son, Derrick and other people were there. And let me tell you--anyway--when we got to--we used to do the Ritual--we'd do love. We'd do Civil Rights Movement, what is happening now or just some--you would know what was coming next. Or who was sitting next to you because nobody started on the stage. Somebody might--one person might start but somebody just jump and start singing or start to create or whatever. And you wouldn't know what was gonna happen. So this--when this girl ran in and hollerin' oh, they shot him. Wayne Watson, out with a pistol, Derrick Femster, Mari Evans-- Story_ID: 72679 Speaker 1: You were in the midst, you know, she comes with her--(simultaneous) Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, she comes screaming, they shot him, they shot him. So [HM] Wayne Watson and Derrick Femster (ph.)--out with these pistols--well, they ran down Robert's Motel. I don't know if it's still there--was down the street from, from this place right across from [HM] Margaret [Burroughs]'s house, looking for the man who--somebody they shot--this is the play going on, right? So when they came back, originally--let me tell you what happened prior to that--no, I'll finish tellin' you the other two places. We did it at a church in front of Cabrini Green [Chicago, Illinois], a Catholic church, maybe like three weeks or so after that. And two policemen had just been shot over there but this--we did a lot of--instead of people doing regular Sunday morning service, they would invite us in and we would just perform. Pete Cosey (ph.), we had top people--people played with Miles and everything, long before Bobby played--in Kuumba. Donny Hathaway used to be in Kuumba. We just did--so anyway we doing this over there and a man ran outside, the people jumped up, broker up the performance. One of the times Judge--it's Joan Collaso, you probably hear Joan Collaso now. Joan is a singer, she come from Kuumba. You know her from Precious Memories, you know, but she's all over like Collette and them. Anyway, Joan's father, they had always gone to, I think, St. Thomas or some other private schools and something, but the judge had invited us to the police station because they had started the--Mr. [Officer] Friendly, or whatever the police--and they were trying to get the community and the, you know, people that really like and let them know that the policeman are just people and they were trying to protect them or whatever. So they invited us over, Judge Walton, that's her father. I know you might have met him before. Oh, excuse me. And so Judge Walton invited us to the police station to do--perform. So the way we would do whatever we were going to do, some people would go earlier so that you would not be suspicious. Some people would be dressed in African clothes, some people would be dressed as you are dressed today, up all or whatever--whomever--if some--just in regular clothes. And so when we started the Ritual, they said, they welcomed Kuumba there and when we got to that--oh, they were just really enjoyed it and that girl ran in from outside and said, "Oh, my God, they shot him, shot him," and he said, "Get these nappy head people out here and see the trouble had come right up in the police station." And I said, "Judge, you're interrupting the performance." He opened his mouth, the same thing I said to [HM] Wayne Watson when [HM] Wayne Watson came back that night from Robert's, looking for this man. He said, sister, right out in the middle out in the middle of the thing-"Sister, well, how could you all be continuing and somebody shot"--we didn't find nobody out there shot and why don't you just turn this thing off. And I said, "[HM] Wayne [Watson], will you please take your seat, you're interrupting," 'cause now we're into the love thing, doing blues and doing whatever. That same night, when we started the Ritual, this was on a Sunday night. This goes Thursday through Sunday. There was this little church on Indiana [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] that--we didn't know about--maybe storefront, right? 'Cause we go to taverns but we didn't go to no storefront churches. And so they heard us doing the Ritual and they said, oh, my goodness, one night when they didn't have service, they were gonna visit this church in this building, 3831. We weren't--we were theater, right? But we were doing the church part of the Ritual and I'm just preaching, you know. (Singing) And God stepped on space (humming), you know, so they--these people came about seven or eight of them and the mother with this little white uniform on and the hat, little hat and everything and she shouted all over the place. Then she started her own song and just took over the Ritual. So everybody looking at me, sayin', "Lord, now what--Sister Val, what are we gonna do now?" Because we always had a forum, you know, and direction. I gave direction--we knew those of us that were in the production, The Ritual but nobody else knew. So everybody is looking at me now, what are we going to do now 'cause this lady think this is real. And she's just up testifying and everything and so I couldn't get her to stop so I just started with the blues, you know. So when I started with the blues, this deacon that was with her, had already testified--gotten up and testified but when I started the blues, he reached into his hand pocket, inside pocket and came out with a harmonica and started blowing. He said, "Ya'll got to forgive me right now church people," 'cause they don't know I got this thing. And he played the blues. I've got all of those photographs for the archives here. I mean this really, really happened. Another time, we did a west side church, I think 14th and Holman [Chicago, Illinois] or something and a man ran up that was playing the organ. Oh, he was just playin' down, Terry Pete (ph.), Rita Warford 'cause I'm tellin' you some people belong they see 'em, belong to Kuumba--belong. Somebody was up singing and this girl ran in and says, oh, Lord, they shot him and this man left his shoe. He had this shoe, one shoe off, he's doing this with the organ and he, and we got that picture too, with him running out. So we had incredible, incredible times. And after that, people sayin' well, you got to get out of that black stuff. Since that time, we were--been to Africa to Japan and to Canada and all those other places, you know. Story_ID: 72680 Speaker 1: Let's talk about how The Ritual--how did The Ritual develop and what was The Ritual? Speaker 2: The Ritual developed out of exactly what I do in the one woman show today. I was doing it prior to the founding of Kuumba, starting off with, you taking my blues notes on commercial theater, with the blues and the spiritual and then the things that I'm tellin' you about either prose and/or poetry or just the story that had taken place in the news--out of the newspaper. You had to--I mean in workshop, I mean we'd work on it and create that. So that you could hold the people while you were telling it--they didn't know you were tellin' a story--and then you give credit to the or whomever had the by-line. Speaker 1: But The Ritual--was it broken down into a certain number of parts? Speaker 2: Yeah, it was always--it was 'Destruction or Unity,' that was the name of it. But under 'Destruction and Unity,' we would do church. We would do current events, what was happening. And when I say church, the old church and some of the songs like, we used to take songs like, and this is how we got a lot of the church people involved in it. "Were You There", I don't know if you ever heard (singing)-"were you there when they crucified my Lord?" Well, we would change it, (singing)-"were you there when they shot poor Malcolm [X] down," and Fred Hampton or whatever and we would do all the (singing)-"oh, sometimes it causes me to tremble"--people would just be crying and we'd, you know. You know, we would sing well and we would put it together and so we would take what people already knew and then you could always bring anybody, young or old, black or white, and you didn't have to worry about all that cursing. Because a lot of people wouldn't go to--they say I don't want to go to this black theater because first thing they're doing is shooting their momma and their daddy and they're putting down the church and everybody. No, we would just take the forums that people already knew and create from that and so originally when it's time to change it, somebody change it, you know. Change it, if you're the changer, you're the thing from--I mean to blues and gospel or whatever. It was wonderful. Story_ID: 72681 Speaker 1: Oh, and I didn't tell you about the tavern. One time we went to this tavern. It was a tavern on 87th named the--same as a car--what is it--like a Pontiac. The--it was named something so we had three taverns to go to. We had to go to tavern at 39th and Indiana [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois]. That was like quote low class and 87th this thing was where the pip, upper middle class would hang out, right? And, at that time, I'll never forget it. They were doing 'Hair' down--I think it was at the Shubert [Theater] and so this was the assignment this week, to go to take the plays into taverns, right? And Gwendolyn Brooks was with us. And said--they say, well, how we gonna do it? And I say, again, different people are gonna arrive at different times and be drinking and whatever. Some people were in the naturals, some people were in the African clothes, right? And so I--Sondra Malone, [Ngena] Kimi Moyo said I got to go home and, well, at that time, she used to do that thing about "Oh, they shot him," right? 'Cause this other girl's now gone to Hollywood, right? And so she said cause--for--Christian Sprague (ph.), she had to go home. So she says, "Sister Val, can I please go?" And I said, only if somebody can do it. So there was a lady called Mother, Lucille Whitehall (ph.), show you guys, The HistoryMakers later pictures of Mother. 'Cause she used to go pick kids up from the projects and things and bring them to Kuumba into the workshops. And she'd say, "Sister Val, please can I do that?" And I'd say, "Mother, but you're not in acting, you can't." She said, "Please let me do it." So, okay, Terry [Pete] went and (unclear) now if anything goes wrong, some person get up and go to the bathroom and, you know, and give the signal to--so we went to--oh, I can't think the name of this place on 87th between East End and Stony Island [Chicago, Illinois]. And so we were in this place and so some of our people were already sitting there, dressed suave, you know, and everything and the rest of us came in. So when we came in with these naturals and dressed up--man started looking at us and say, "Yeah, may I help you?" "Yeah, well we just thought we'd have a drink," and he said, yeah, (unclear) different people sitting there and they had tables there and they were like really didn't care what these quote militants, you know, what are you coming in here for? And I just started out (singing), the day you walked away and let me--so I say, sing it and we had 'em. We knew that we had 'em, between the juke box, you know. And we just started and so then Mother, who lived 86th and Blackstone, 87th, 89th and Blackstone [Chicago, Illinois] was late getting there but she just looked from the outside 'cause they had the tinted long windows across the place and she just came in hollering, "haaa haaa" (chuckling). So this man said, "What's wrong with you, bitch? Don't come in here with that yelling." He said, "These militants are in here trying to tell me something and here you come in here with your loud ass drunken self," (laughter) and this was a really religious old lady. She didn't know what to say and she "ahhhhh ahhhh." So that just tickled the rest of us so bad and she said, "They, they shot him," and some--but anyway by that time, I told the man, 'cause he was really getting ready to put her out, that she was part of The Ritual. And they couldn't--so after that, they allowed us to finish and when, by the time we finished, people were crying. And this one man who owned that place--every--after that his children started coming bringing other children from his community. Same thing with Judge Walton, that's how Joan Collaso became a Parker. She was taken music down here on south Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] and new--they thought she was going to be an opera singer. He put her in Kuumba right then. Story_ID: 72682 Speaker 1: So I mean they're wonderful, wonderful stories to tell that came out of, of that Ritual. You know, and I'm looking at people today that like my niece, Cheryl Green who is this psychologist, head psychologist out at Chicago State [University, Illinois]. She was just a little girl, you know, when she used to talk about Jamestown and all that. Well, I've got all those pictures and all of those things and it's one of the reasons that, when I see a piece done on black theater or theater in Chicago [Illinois] and how some of the people just ignore or try to ignore--they can't because a lot of the people that's with them today, either came out of Kuumba and [HM] Francis [Ward] and I were one of the founders of E-T-A [Creative Arts Theater] and Vince Cullers and Archie Weston was an attorney; Joan Brown and Harold Johnson who's the co-owner by now--is now. But I always said, if you're here tonight and after the other theaters were founded--and it was founded as a talent agency, go to whatever. And Jackie, [HM] Jackie Taylor was a student and lived at Cabrini Green [Chicago, Illinois] and I went there and did 'Harriet Tubman' but then I didn't even know that I had this effect on her life and she said, "We were in the bathroom smoking cigarettes and pot and the teacher said, 'come out because this woman here that's gonna do 'Harriet Tubman'?'" And we don't want to be bothered and she said, "She caught us by the collar and brought us out" and said--she said and you performed and "I knew from that day on that that's what I wanted to do and wanted to be." So, you know. Speaker 2: So you were, it was as if your theater was almost like the--jazz--in many ways. It was very improvisational, very (simultaneous). Speaker 1: Yes, yeah. Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: And what I do now. And I know, you know, a lot of times, quartet I'd play with, I just did 'Rhapsody in Hughes' at the Kansas City Jazz Museum [Missouri] and I did that with a quartet of four. Performed at Yale University [Connecticut] with--in my one woman show and it's called, 'My Soul Is A Witness' and sometimes musicians say, "Ooooh, can I play?" Or I'd go into places and perform with and just pick up musicians there; like in Ohio. Whenever I perform in Ohio now, the Ohio state [University]'s jazz band always perform with me but I perform there oh--way--when they first got started in black studies. Story_ID: 72683 Speaker 1: Now what--what did--when did Kuumba decide that it was going to leave the streets and find a home? Speaker 2: Oh, no when--we had a home. We were at 38th and Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], when we were doing all these things in the street. No, we were at 3831 South Michigan, the South Side Arts Center [Chicago, Illinois], where Gwendolyn Brooks and Margaret White and Charles White and all of them, Margaret Dana (ph.), they used to have the writer's workshop downstairs and the art exhibit. And I think (unclear) Herb Nipson was on the board then. I guess he might still be. But, no, we were upstairs, on the second floor. And then when we left the South Side Arts Center, there's a church, I think at 46th and Ellis. We went there and because they were complaining that, you know, we were too loud. I think we were getting too much attention from them. I shouldn't say that but anyway, our second home was the--at--on Ellis but we must have stayed there in the basement of that church for about six months and then we went to, from there to--oh, what's this church behind the [Chicago] Defender, historical church that was part of the underground--(simultaneous) Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (unclear). Speaker 2: Quinn Chapel [A.M.E., African Methodist Episcopal Church, Chicago, Illinois]. And we performed out of Quinn Chapel and from Quinn Chapel, we were waiting for 22, 22 South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois]. And from there, I think we went to downtown, to 343. No, south Dearborn was the office but where was that on Wabash, you know, there. Then for a little while, we were at the opera house, small theater at the opera house and--and then to Malcom X. Those were the various homes. Story_ID: 72684 Speaker 1: Now what do you consider significant parts, points in Kuumba's history? You know significant sort of stepping stones? Or what are you most proud of? Speaker 2: I'm proud of all of it. Speaker 1: So can you talk about some of the significance? Speaker 2: I think the significant thing is the people that Kuumba touched and the people that touched Kuumba because now people like Margaret Wilkerson or others or I'd go to these universities and people would say, "Well, I was studying, did some research or I did some whatever"; or "I ran into so and so," and they told me and a lot of people that were even in Kuumba but didn't know anybody else to say that they knew in Chicago [Illinois], that they were part of it and they were trying to get an audition on Broadway or whatever, or in California. And so it's the institutions built out of the people and the people that we've been able to touch around the world in places and the people that have touched us. We used to do even funerals during the 70s [1970]. People wouldn't, you know, we had to perform funerals that--not just musicians but people were bringing their sons home from the war and we had to perform funerals. So we did a lot of things and we were, to me, art is life and so we were taking in, giving back. And I can't point to any one thing, those taverns were wonderful and I know that people believed what we were doing because they--the reactions that they had and the people--let me tell you--when we were getting ready to go to FESTAC [World Festival of Black Arts], that's the festival in Nigeria. The first festival was held in Senegal, that was in '77 [1977]. So the first festival was held in Senegal in 19, ooooh, what was that because I got my first big award from that festival. Oh, God--the 7--let me see--I don't know, but it was '74 [1974], I went to the first Six Pan Africanist [sic, Pan African] Conference held on the continent of Africa. And that was founded by Dr. [W.E.B.] DuBois and everybody, that was in '74 [1974] so maybe the first festival was held in '73 [1973] in Senegal. But anyway, by this time, we getting world recognition, world awards and people writing us and people that like Twin 77 that are now big, big artists in Nigeria, those people came to 3831 and before they were Twin 77, they gave us paintings and gave me stuff, you know what I mean. And so all over the world and the world was then becoming really, really small because by now I'm going to Guyana and Antigua and C-V-I College of the Virgin Islands and Jamaica and places. So the world had gotten small and all parts of Africa, you know, we're learning and then we're exchanging and playwrights and so forth. So I can't tell you one specific thing but I can tell you many things. When we got ready to go to FESTAC [World Festival of Black Arts], that's what I was getting ready to tell you, in '77 [1977], they chose twenty-five companies in the U.S. We were one of those companies that were to perform in Nigeria at the festival. And the Image Makers, we took. And a lady, I don't know if you ever met Angela Brown, poet, wonderful, wonderful poet. One of the original people--she's not originally one of the babies of [Chuck] Obasi but she was a student at Northwestern [University, Illinois], I think then. Her mother--between, we were at 2222 South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] and so we didn't have to do anything but we wanted to take our own props and things over there. And so in order to do that, we needed money because I took twenty-five people in Image Makers to FESTAC and so I said, well, we don't have money to take the props and they're paying for everything else, they're paying, you know, put you up and the village and blah, blah, blah. And so [WVON] V-O-N and [HM] Marv Dyson, I think but I know [WVON] V-O-N and I think [HM] Marv Dyson put on a telethon, a radio-a-thon and had people raise money and so they were broadcasting from 22nd and Michigan [Chicago, Illinois]. And Angela [Brown]'s mother, I found out later that it was her mother, said, "I am giving part of my," maybe she didn't say food stamps, but relief money or whatever, "but don't tell Val Ward because she'll be trying to have a benefit for me before she leaves to go to Africa." I want to make sure that I help pay for their going. It's things like that and it's people who made costumes or gave us furniture out of their house or their clothes and whatever, because one of the things that I knew that we had to do, and that was be good at what we--we couldn't just do something because--and particularly what we were tryin' to say and what we were tryin' to get over, but we had to be as good as the Goodman [Theater] or Second City or whomever. And, in that sense, we were. And I kept it--also knock on wood because my friends at Second City and the Goodman [Theater] and, at that time, Marci (ph.) and people at Victory Garden [Theater], even before we started the League of Theaters, everybody like helped one another and shared. And it was so, it was just the right time. Story_ID: 72685 Speaker 1: Now, what, who--(simultaneous) Speaker 2: Oh, can I tell you another story? There was a young lady, I told you about a lot of students that was in Harvard Law School [Massachusetts]. And (laughter) Speaker 1: Don't say that Val. Speaker 2: Don't? Speaker 1: --Hmmmm hmmm. Speaker 2: Well, it's the truth- Speaker 1: No, but don't do that. Speaker 2: (Laughter). Speaker 1: No, but talk about some of the other people--(simultaneous) Speaker 2: But that's, that's one of the price. Speaker 1: Okay but talk about some of the other people that were helpful for, you know, what--(simultaneous)- Speaker 2: Oh, oh, so many people--oh, Kuumba did some of the undoable, that's what Gwendolyn Brooks says about my life, that I could do the undoable. But people, business people, as Sammy Rayner gave us chairs out of his funeral home. Those chairs are at ETA [Creative Arts Theater, Chicago] today 'cause when we left 22nd Street, we gave them those fold up chairs. People used to take things out of their home. People used to give us money and when we really got, when we're downtown and I will never forget this, [HM] Earl Neal once gave a big party at the--is it the Empire Room at the Palmer House [Chicago, Illinois]? Yes, Curtis Ellis band, big band--not Curtis Ellis, Jimmy Ellis, his brother, Ellis' big band, filet mignon or whatever and rib eye, whatever, rib, steak and everything. I think that's maybe really later one, we were doing, I guess, House of the Blues [Chicago, Illinois] and he just bought the house out one Sunday for all of the upper, upper middle class. I mean limousines galore and then afterwards, dinner at this place. And I said to [HM] Earl [Neal], "Earl, why didn't you give Kuumba this money 'cause these people are really not going to"--he said, "No, these people are now gonna support and they're gonna send checks." Well, I have to tell this-[HM] John H. Johnson--not [HM] John H. Johnson-[HM] George Johnson sent a check for one thousand dollars, Darryl Grisham who always made pledges, bless his heart, oh, this is it, you've arrived now but Darryl [Grisham], a long time ago, always have these big dreams for Kuumba and me, it would've never came true of course, didn't give a penny. And maybe, I know that [HM] Earl [Neal] bought out the house but that house, you know, was small and paid for all those people that day but very few people but some people did, you know, become involved with the board and so forth. The next really big financial things that happened to us is, we wanted to move a production of 'Bessie Smith' which had gotten wonderful reviews, so had House of the Blues [Chicago, Illinois]. I got rights (unclear), calling right now just, just beautiful. We wanted to move it to another theater and the Ivanhoe [Theater, Chicago, Illinois] was just opening at that time and I think they had done one production and, so I had had a couple of meetings and had people and people come in to see it, you know, backer's meeting so the people hadn't come up with this money. So [HM] Bettiann Gardner called me about one o'clock at night and she said, "Val," she said, "Forget about all of those people that we were trying to get to put money up. [HM] Ed [Gardner] and I are gonna put up the money," and, of course, they put up over four hundred and some thousand dollars to take 'Bessie Smith'. They paid for Bessie Smith's son to come here, playwright, every--costumes, everything. And we took, at that production, we took fourteen people, the Actor's Equity Union, at that time. And that was incredible because my friends like [HM] Woodie King and others had told me, "You can't do that." Or a woman who was at, oh, it wasn't--Steppenwolf [Theater, Chicago, Illinois] then--what was that theater--that had just produced another production over there? And she said, why are you looking at this theater--this woman from New York--and I said, because I'm gettin' ready to bring in-"How are you gonna bring in your production in here? Who's gonna pay for it?" Said, don't worry about it, but I did. And it was just wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Another wonderful thing happened--two wonderful things happened. Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Gotta change this. Speaker 2: I have to tell this about John-- Story_ID: 72686 Speaker 1: You were getting ready to talk about [HM] John H. Johnson. Speaker 2: There's several things that I need to say about [HM] John H. Johnson. One, I met my husband there. That was really wonderful and he always tease me, whenever he see--oh, you got [HM] Francis [Ward] and I never got the story. But that's not true. But he teased me about that but I remember one time, we're getting ready to have a major affair at the train station, that's when Dearborn Street [Chicago, Illinois] just opened up again, the South Loop. And I called Mr. [HM John H.] Johnson and I said--whenever--that's one thing--whenever I wanted to call him up, they would--Aileen (ph.), or whomever would say, "I say, Tom, it's Val Ward," he would really take my call, even when my husband worked there because earlier when we did the book, 'To Gwen With Love,' I, I, and [HM] Francis [Ward] was still working there then. I asked Mr. [HM John H.] Johnson would he print the book because all these people had come in from around the country and, I guess, around the world and we'd done the performance at Afro Arts Theater [Chicago, Illinois]. And so I called him up and so I came down to 1820 South Mission--and they say-Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois]-"Mr. [HM John H.] Johnson isn't in. And I say, well, wherever he is, you can get him on the phone because Hugh Heffner--I tried to get all the people and I wanted to publish this book. I wanted a black publisher to publish it. And so Hugh Heffner had sent me a telegram and a conference--he called and said, "I love Gwendolyn Brooks. I love all of her works and I will publish the book and I want the money to go, from the book, to the Institute of Black World--Margaret--to DuSable Museum and Institute of Black World and the Black Women's Committee." And he said, "I'll do that all." So that was all I needed. So I came down to 1820 [Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] so [HM] Francis [Ward] said, "Oh, my God, I know I'm gonna lose my job now." And [HM] Lerone [Bennett] was about to have a heart attack. I brought [HM] Woodie King, [HM] Sonia Sanchez, all of us was sitting--John O. Killens--all of us--people had been that Sunday for the thing. So they took us to the conference room and so Mr. [HM John H.] Johnson was like on the speaker phone and he said, "Val, what do you want now? I'm feeding you and your children," and I said, "Well my husband earns that." I say, "I'm here because I want you to publish Gwendolyn Brooks and I had several other demand and I want you to change Negro Digest to Black World, to a black name"--call it black and it became Black World. So he said, "Yes, I'll do it and get out of there." He put out that book 'To Gwen With Love.' He published it--and they just--I understand--but I've asked him to reissue it now. And I gotta try to get to Linda or somebody again. He did that. And so about--when this train station we're doing, I don't know what anniversary that was, but I remember it was one hundred or two hundred dollars a ticket and so I called Mr. [HM John H.] Johnson up and I said, I told him what [HM] Ed [Gardner] gotten--he said, "Don't tell me 'bout what the Gardners have done." And I said, "Mr. [HM John H.] Johnson, please I need you to give Kuumba a really sizeable amount of money." And what I'll do is, I'll name the theater after his mother--'cause his mother--he was--I knew his mother, knew his first cousin. And he said, "No, I don't want it named after my mother," and he said, "You know you got a lot of nerves, but come down here," and I said, "Great." I said I want to bring my board members and we can pose for photographs 'cause then he said, "Hell, no. Your board members didn't get this. I'm giving this to you 'cause you steadfast, you believe in and your stick-to-it-ness," that's what he said to me. I got in a cab and I came down there. And he said, "You and [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson got more nerve than anybody I know, to ask me for my hard earned money and then talk about"--I said, "Mr. [HM John H.] Johnson, I don't talk about you"-"Oh, yeah, I heard that you said, talk about Ebony magazine and what I do," he said, "But I'm gonna give you one hundred thousand dollars." And he did and the night we had that affair, Linda made the first installment check of twenty-five thousand dollars and that's significant. But other people gave dimes and quarters and nickels and because, at that time, people used to say to me--and he said to me--even when I started making the pie--he said, "Please don't make that pie black." Just like everybody likes that pie and just make that a business deal (laughter) and don't make it a black thing. He did. He said, "Do you know how much money you could be making?" And I said, "Yeah." He said, "But you ain't gonna do that." I said, "Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna do it." But it's people like that and [HM] Earl Neal and Vince Cullers and just unsung people, you know, Mary Jones, up and down the street 'cause, you know, and even the gangs. When my house was fire bombed, they called me up. The Vice Lords calls me up, the Rangers call me up and say, "Sister Val," 'cause [HM] Francis [Ward] had--I'd taken him to the airport and when I got back, the fire department was at the house and everything, they said, nobody is gonna mess with you. Nobody's gonna mess with--and we hadn't done anything but some policemen's son, some white policemen's police son who had lived in the neighborhood--and it was all mostly white; Judge what's his name, live around the corner from me, it was like and [HM] Lerone [Bennett] used to live around the other corner. It was about four or five of us blacks that lived in the neighborhood and they had fire bombed my house so--it's crazy. Story_ID: 72687 Speaker 1: Two things I want you to talk about--(simultaneous) Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: One 'The Amen Corner' launch and also 'Precious Memories'. Speaker 2: The first time we did it and I brought that playbill with me. We did it at, I think, at 2222 South Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois]. And then the major production of it, we did--oh, no, I think we'd been to Broadway [New York] at that time and did it in the festival--the ten year national theater companies and maybe we had done it in Detroit [Michigan] but I know that when we took it downtown Chicago at the [Chicago] Playhouse [Fine Arts Theater], the--oh, what's that place called--the--what the-hmmmmmm--Chicago Playhouse or whatever. It's now back to a theater. It used to be--years ago--it used to be a legitimate house and the Amen Corner was the first production. Speaker 1: Fine Arts Theater. Speaker 2: Chicago Fine Arts [sic], yeah. Speaker 1: It's the Fine Arts Theater. Speaker 2: That's what it is now. Speaker 1: That's what it was then. Speaker 2: --was then, okay. It was the something playhouse, yeah, maybe Fine Arts Playhouse [sic]. Speaker 1: But refer to 'Amen Corner' because people (simultaneous)- Speaker 2: Yeah, but 'Amen Corner' could--but when we did that usually, you know, James Baldwin was my very good friend and he had told me for the rights that I could do it 'cause the unions were giving me hell. They would--when we took the play to the World Playhouse [sic, Fine Arts Theater], that's what it was called, they had these men sit--been sitting there thirty or forty years, playing bid--whatever they play--black people, they play bid whist, don't they. Cards, union people but they wouldn't allow us to bring--do the take in, whatever. But they allowed for--'cause that was before we were union, right? So they allowed Babitu (ph.) do the break, come in and build a set and everything, while they played cards, but we had to pay them--play cards, but we had to pay them union scale while they sat there and played the cards. But we did that at the World Playhouse and I think that was--oh, and night, the night we were getting ready to open, we got a call--the theater said, oh, no, we cannot because we just got a call from, oh, what's the people you get the rights from, the (simultaneous). Speaker 1: Equity? Speaker 2: No, not, equity 'cause we were gonna pay people equity. The--what they--you get to rent the rights to--for the play. Speaker 1: From the publisher? Speaker 2: Yeah. Not the publisher but the people who have the rights to (simultaneous)- Speaker 1: Royalty. Speaker 2: Royalties--that you pay the royalties to for the play. Oh, God, I should know that if I know my name. But anyway, and I said, "What do you mean?" They say, I'm not gonna be able to open--this was like maybe like four or five o'clock. I had to call, get James Baldwin in southern France and I said, "They're not gonna allow you to do it." And he said, "Oh, yes, they are. That's my play and I wrote it." He said, and when they-"When I tried to write it, they didn't want me to"--the publishers--his own publishers didn't want him to write. The same thing when he just spoke for my tenth anniversary. The people told me he wasn't gonna come. He said, "Yes, I am and you don't have to pay a cent. My house and my plane fare from Paris or anything--from France--and southern France." And so he called in and that's the only way I was able to do that. I had a lot of obstacles and boy, the union hall, they used to come down there and say, we had too many seats and they were in the pathway and they went into this--a lot of harassment but. And one time, we were doing [Useni Eugene Perkins] 'The Image Makers' just before we were going to take that to Africa. People put me, [HM] Francis [Ward], Rhonda and Makai (ph.) up against the wall and Michael Pugh (ph.), detectives--what are you--what--put your hands--we could--they were in a brown car, I'll never forget it. The play was just over. Now we know what that plays about. What is the play about? Play is a satire on black exploitation films, right? Oh, no, some white people get killed in there. I said, "But that's a metaphor, we're just destroying these images 'cause pimps and whores and dope pushers are not heroes, they should not be heroes and that's what it's about." Makai (ph.) and Makai could have been killed, you know. And--you better turn my mother and father loose, you know. But anyway and a couple of the actors they caught them. So we been doing, you know, and never doing anything but basic theater. Story_ID: 72688 Speaker 1: Now what about 'Precious Memories'? Talk about 'Precious Memories'. Speaker 2: Well, Channel 11 [Chicago PBS affiliate WTTW] wanted to do 'Amen Corner' and they had lot of conversations with Jimmy [James Baldwin] and Jimmy was playing at the, oooh, what's that place, (simultaneous) Speaker 1: Jimmy who? Speaker 2: Not--Jimmy--James Baldwin. I say Jimmy. I'm sorry, James Baldwin. But he had written a piece on Malcolm [X] and he wouldn't let Hollywood do it because they'd want--didn't want his directors and so forth. And he said, "Val, they're not gonna allow you to do 'Amen Corner' the way you do 'Amen Corner.'" Same thing on New York, people told me, you can't come to Broadway and Lincoln Center and do--new--the way you got--you gotta do it for Broadway. Just doing what I do will work anywhere, good entertainment, right? So, when we were getting ready to do--they want Channel 11 [Chicago PBS affiliate WTTW], Glenn and whatever his other friend, Glenn Dubose was the producer and they used to come to Kuumba and see and we were good friends and so he said, I want to do that. So James Baldwin said, "If they would let you do it that way, I will do it." So Jimmy was in for some--I think he was in for Kuumba's--I don't know what he was here for. But anyway we met at the Pump Room--not the Pump Room--what's the--Ambassador? What's that place with the booth--booth one, two? Famous booths, you know? What's that place? Ambassador, I think. And anyway, and [HM] Fran Harth, well, I knew [HM] Fran [Harth] 'cause I knew her and her husband before. I knew him before and we met and so we talked and so he said that he was gonna allow him to do it. So--but he called afterward and say, no, he was in Atlanta [Georgia] writing a book on those little kids that were missing. I'm not gonna allow them to do it. He said, because they don't have your interests at heart. No, I'm not--if they try to talk to me about your doing it, no, they can't do it. So, okay. He didn't allow to do it. So about maybe three or four months after that, I called Glenn [Dubose] up because I had a thought one night, I said, Glenn [Dubose], when Channel 11 [Chicago PBS affiliate WWTW] first really got started doing black shows, I've got the original, we did a piece there and I got pictures from that too. And I said, "I would really like to do a piece," I said, "But I will have to direct it." [HM] Francis [Ward] will write it for me. I have this concept. And it's kind of--it's a mixture of some of the stuff that I've already done but, you know, he'll write it out for me. Sayin', I tell you, why don't you mount it? And then we will look at it, after you get review and we will see and we'll bring some people out, Caruthy (ph.), I think his name was and other people and if they like it, you know, then we'll do it. And I said, no. And they told me different people and other people have directors. No, no, no, no, I have to do this and I told them I had to do my interviews because some of the people would not respond to the people that they're talkin' about they want. I said, I have to go and interview these people and put it together and made my demands like the things I wanted them to bring. And I said, "Well, we have to bring in make-up artists and the costumes." No, no, no, no. Ingrid [Grimes Myles] and Jonathan [Lucas] have to do the costumes and I would do--Mr. [HM John H.] Johnson, I say, now I want you to bring me--to make up people who will be paid and it was Ingrid [Grimes Myles] and I brought my sister, Doris, in. She did the hair. And, Lenny Simmons (ph.), we did borrowed the organ from him and the person who did the set had done the very first set from the very first production Kuumba ever did for Channel 11 [Chicago PBS affiliate WTTW], the first that they ever had done-'Came'. That's what we did. Do you remember the piece 'Came'? It's a classical black piece and so, he, they said, well, I got them talkin' so we talked here, to and fore and I got Mark Jones as my lawyer to, you know, start negotiating and then they said, yeah, well, we'll do it. And so they started, they said yeah and this was gonna cost them seven hundred thousand dollars in house to do 'cause they had to pay all the royaltors [sic] and they had to have the costumes made and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So we did it. So I wanted it to be a two hour in like a series or whatever. And they said, "Oh, no, a half an hour because you aren't gonna get--you want the entire audience and you're not gonna get the entire audience to look at black people that long." I said, "I guarantee you that if it's done and done right, yes, it will." And we did it and, as you know, it won Emmys, twenty-one Emmys, all the people in it. It went out and to win all kind of awards and the highest award that--and it won the best of PS, PBS nationally. And then, in the International Television and Film Festival, Julie Andrews won first place. It won second place and David Bowie won third. And they had a lot of people, lot of pieces, you know in the International Television and Film Festival. And so one of the--I learned a lot from that. I did all of my own pre-editing, Babitu (ph.) and I for three weeks and then they edited. They did the--after that. But we put in the right things and I got all my outtakes and everything and one of the things that I did wrong is I gave them television rights and they told me they wanted to do the international market because this would really work in the international market. They never did the international market and, as far as it was ever shown, that I know of, is why because one of the musicians was over there and he called my musicians and told 'em he'd just saw him, Sonny on there but, you know, we had a really hard time because I owned fifty percent of it. And they didn't want--they thought that that was wrong. Oh, after we put in all of this money. I said, yeah, but I put my brains, my direction, my husband wrote it and all the other people were paid union scale, you know, and I wasn't paid. I think I might have gotten a two thousand dollar check after that and that's all I ever got from that piece and they still playing it. Oh, PBS in Boston and [channel] 13 in New York, wherever Glenn [Dubose] is. I guess he's still there. And all down the South in Bloomington, Indiana and it's in--when I go to the film festivals, yeah. Story_ID: 72689 Speaker 1: Well, let's also talk Val that really the theater was in many ways a family affair. Your whole--I mean you've mortgaged your house, you know, your children- Speaker 2: I never did mortgage my house- Speaker 1: Okay (unclear)- Speaker 2: No, no. But if I hadn't had a family affair in the sense that wherever my husband was working, whether it was here for the Los Angeles Times, the Johnson or [Chicago] Sun Times or wherever, he really, really, really did a lot of the administrative work. But had my children, if I didn't involve them, I would have been an unfit mother. And when people ask them today, are you in theater and Babitu (ph.) is the only one that has been--stayed in it all this time. But I loved my children but I loved--I had to do what I had to do. And fortunately, they've been able to go to other parts of the world and so forth. And there were times--because one of the things that we didn't do, that I know now and I hope one day to, I guess, just do a paper. I used to want to do a book, from concept to reality, the building of a black arts institution, is you must build aboard and you must have people as strong administratively or maybe even stronger than you are artistically and all of you know, the connections that I've had and still have and people are really my friends, I could wine and dine on their yachts and do whatever and come to all the first-nighters and get free tickets and everything. But they really didn't raise money and support Kuumba. Well, a lot of people said, "Well, that was because you wanted to run things." No, first thing some people wanted to do was change the name. Wasn't going to change the name, you know. We're gonna do all the things that, that needed to be done but none of these people did like--some of my friends like--what's his name on the other--advertising agency? Vincent [Cullers], Marian [Cullers] always helped as much as they could. Oh, his wife used to be my very good friend. Anyway, they got on the board of-Goodman [Theater, Chicago, Illinois]--a lot of that was for political reasons or other reasons. But they raised money and they saw to those companies having money and costumes and the rest--I know people who've sat on organic or Wisdom Bridge [Theater] or whatever. Those people, very rich women would come up in their limousines or whatever. They would get up and help with the chairs and help with this but they gave money and they raised money for those theaters. And unless I talk about the money that [HM] Ed Gardner and [HM] John H. Johnson, big money, I mean people talked about it. I mean [HM] Elzie [Higginbottom] was one of the first people and I showed him that building that I wanted down there where he is today. I guess he's still there, at twenty something and Michigan, 26th or whatever that is, you know, they didn't but they would invite me to their golf outings or whatever their first night is and whatever. And then people were good but they didn't bring to Kuumba the other things that Kuumba needed. And for that reason, I would have to mortgage--do part of my mortgage--never mortgaged my house but you know, take money from my car, costumes, clothes and loaned money to the theater and always paid other people when I didn't pay myself. And that's one thing that I remember Abiner (ph.) used to tell me when she was at the Y, before she left the Y to come to ETA. It was ETA [Creative Arts, Chicago] at that time, Ebony Town, she said, I'm gonna pay my insurance. I'm gonna pay my salary, if I don't pay nobody else. Well, I wouldn't do that. I made sure that other people were paid. And I got all the awards in the world and not that I don't appreciate 'em but you can't spend 'em, you know, I pay the light and that's one of the things that I wish I had done differently. And, but now, you know, things are different and the people are good to me and a lot of people that I helped, you know, now help me and they would say, look, I wouldn't have been doing this or doing that and so- Story_ID: 72690 Speaker 1: Comment some on Kuumba's role in black theater, you know, the role that Kuumba played, it's role in history. Speaker 2: That's hard for me to talk about. Let me say, I couldn't say enough and I can't say enough about what my husband and the sacrifices that he made and let me just tell a story that--once we were sitting down to eat and I think, I don't know if it was a holiday or what and I said something, Kuumba, I got to do this. And Rhonda, my youngest child, said to me, "Mommy, can we just have dinner and be here alone and enjoy the dinner without you talking about art or Kuumba," you know, and that just went through my heart, you know. And I starts talking about, you know, where they've been and the things we've done and the people that had been to our house. They said, "I know, momma, but it's important that," you know, and she did that. And the same thing I'm sure the sacrifices that [HM] Francis [Ward] made because he was a national journalist and one of the first--second black journalist that the [Chicago] Sun Times hired, I think and one of the first national journalists that the Los Angeles Times, you know, and he was well recognized. And I'm sure he made a lot of sacrifices for family and for Kuumba, you know. And so I can't say enough about that but it's history. I think that it will speak for itself because as people read and hopefully all of this stuff, all the photographs and films and things that we hope to give to the library here and add to the Harold Washington Library collection and also the historical society, Motley (ph.), always from the beginning. He probably has some stuff and a lot of people have posters and stuff. And--but I have, you know, pieces from Japan, the Montreal Jazz Festival, [Mayor] Harold Washington inviting us back from the Montreal Jazz Festival. I remember when Hatcher ran for mayor of Gary [Indiana], Kuumba, before they opened [Chicago, Illinois] DuSable Museum [for African American History], I got pictures of us performing; matter of fact, the young lady that was head of the, one of the head people at the Art Institute [Chicago]. She left here and went to Texas--Gina?--no, what's her name--oh, God, she used to be at the Goodman [Theater]. But anyway, all of us, they weren't who they are now, you know, big people. But I've got pictures of them and then Kuumba produced people like Beah Richards, Max Roach, that I produced for the [Chicago] Sun Times who's that--Penn and Teller, whoever. And, I mean just so many names that people think, oh, my God, so big, yeah, been there, done that, you know. And so I think that that history will stand for itself and as people teach as they do like my niece, I go to places now and people say, "Oh, Sister Val, are you still saying that or doing that, you were at my grammar school and now you are," and I'll say I'm president of the college, but what effect you had on my life. I ran into a man when my mother died, she died last mother's day and I went home to Mississippi so my brother took me to this--oh, whatever this college farm, where do the testing of the plants and so forth. And so this person that was heading it, I said, oh, this is so wonderful. I was telling him how wonderful it was, all the plants and the, what they were doing, I gave him my card, he said, oh, no, oh, no. And I said, oh, no, what? He said to my brother, "Reverend Ward, do you mean Val Gray Ward is your sister," and he said, "As sure as I'm standing here." And he said, first you know me from Cornell because that's where I did my graduate work. He said, but I did my under graduate work at Tuskegee [University, Alabama], he said. And Dr. Ward, [HM] Francis [Ward]' brother, Edward Ward was my teacher, he said, and you brought me--they brought you there and the choir performed with you the Negro spirituals and you did Harriet Tubman. So that was wonderful and worked at the University of Illinois. I set up their first Afro American Cultural Center, thirty years ago, you know. Been a visiting artist at Howard [University, Washington D.C.], now at a Mennonite school in Virginia, twice up in arts and residents at James Madison in Virginia, you know, and I go all over and now, you know, people are bringing me to Yale and a couple years ago, I was nominated for genius award at the Harvard Radcliffe [Massachusetts]. You know, I didn't receive it, Kathleen Cuneo got it but, you know, I was nominated. And then, and I don't want to talk about I was one of the first people to be nominated for--don't put that for print 'cause maybe I'll still got--get it-McArthur [grant]. But- Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (unclear) Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: NO, that's not for print, that McArthur Park 'cause he told me to just keep living. Speaker 2: Was that recent? Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: Oh, good. Speaker 1: 'Cause he nominated me? Speaker 2: Who? Speaker 1: The head of McArthur. Yeah. Speaker 2: Oh, that's wonderful. Story_ID: 72691 Speaker 1: You were saying about--when you talk about (simultaneous)- Speaker 2: 'Bout theater? I say, if--when the truth is spoken, read or researched about theater in Chicago [Illinois], theater in general or black theater specifically. You cannot, if you do--leave out Kuumba, then your work is undone. Speaker 1: Now I want to ask, if you would give me some short stories about five people that you've mentioned quite a bit, you know, just anecdotes. You can give me one anecdote, each person. One is about Hoyt Fuller. Can you share a memory about him. Speaker 2: Oh, God, one of the most important people, not only in my life, but that ever lived in terms of the literature. And he cared about it, at its--at the height of--height of--I don't even know how to say it, greatness. He didn't believe in nothing petty. He was very particular 'bout the places he ate, what he wore, how he went on vacation but he really cared about writers and he fought and died supporting that and bringing cautiousness to people. I mean, most of the people wouldn't know of Gwendolyn Brooks--I don't mean Gwendolyn [Brooks], I'm sorry; [HM] Nikki Giovanni, [HM] Haki [Mahubuti] who was Don Lee or [HM] Sonia Sanchez and very few people would know of Mari Evans and others and, oh, I could just go on and on and name people. And he brought Africa to the consciousness of all of us, Hoyt Fuller and [HM] Margaret Burroughs. I talked a lot and I can't--we went to Haiti together. We went to Africa together and just the month before he died, [HM] Francis [Ward] and I were at his house because [HM] Francis [Ward] in Atlanta [Georgia], that's where he was originally from too. And we were staying at Hoyt [Fuller]'s house because he was down there doing Black World. And it's really sad because several books have been put out and they've tried--I mean people have tried to be selfish about it but Hoyt [Fuller] was one of my best friends, male or female. I could call him and/or Gwendolyn Brooks, day and night and talk about anything, anything. And he would always tell you, his opinion was not always what you wanted to hear but he was right and Gwendolyn [Brooks] was right. Hoyt [Fuller], we were at Hoyt's house and because he was trying to do First World, was no longer Black World [Negro Digest], First World magazine and he was teaching two days a week at Cornell [University, New York]. James Turner was hiring him as part of his--the help there and then so he could have some income because the money that we were putting together for this magazine really was not enough and even though [HM] Francis [Ward] was editing and writing stories, [HM] Abena [Joan P. Brown] and other people were trying to help and Ann and people all over the country and out of the country. Story_ID: 72692 Speaker 1: He had a heart disease and we didn't--heart, whatever problems and we didn't know it 'cause he just wouldn't share. He was just always--he was very proper, always, the proper person--the best of friends but he was always--my grandmother--I guess, proper. And Hoyt [Fuller] said he had had this person was downstairs massaging him and then he came upstairs and we had dinner and so we're having wine after dinner and he said, "Let me tell you and [HM] Francis [Ward] something." He said, "You're two of the most beautiful people I have ever known." He said, "But take some time for yourself. And do something for yourself, like take vacations, spend some money and some time on yourself." And I said, I started talking; he said, "[HM] Francis [Ward], please can you make her shut up," and he said, "No, you can't." And I kept talking--he pushed me against his refrigerator and said, listen to me, and I said, "Let's go to Haiti like we did." And he said, "No, you and [HM] Francis [Ward] do it together and do it alone. Spend some time before life passes you by." Those are some of the last word Hoyt Fuller ever said to me. That was in his house. When the funeral was over, [HM] Francis [Ward]'s father funeral, we came back to Chicago [Illinois]. I had to go to San Antonio, Texas one month from that time. And it's ironic that you ask him. And ['The Amen] Corner' a while ago because we were getting ready to open [James Baldwin] 'Amen Corner', I think but I had to go to San Antonio, Texas 'cause I'd taken a production. No, I'd been to an N-E-A, National Endowment for the Arts conference that [Livingston] Biddle was holding in San Antonio [Texas]. And in these little boats that you paddle in, a barge hit the boat and knocked it into the bank of the, that W-P-A [Works Progress Administration], whatever, that thing, that big canal [River Walk] that they built there. And I was injured, so I've got a scare from here to here right now 'cause I had to have the knee replaced from that accident. And so in order for me to be back at rehearsal, [HM] Francis [Ward] thought I was gonna stay overnight with my friend, Joe, who ran the Cultural Center in San Antonio [Texas] and I said, "No, I'm coming back for rehearsal." He said, "No, stay all night with Joe and then come back tomorrow." So the only way I could get a flight back and be back for rehearsal was to come through Atlanta [Georgia] and pay the difference. I went--and I think at this time, I was meeting with a lawyer. I had to go out to the hospital near a base, army base or something but I went out there and I came--and I went to the airport and they said the only we can get you back to Chicago [Illinois] is to go through Atlanta [Georgia] 'cause I took a flight from here to San Antonio, I think it stopped in Dallas or something. When I got off the plane instead of calling my mother in law and some other people, I'm calling Hoyt Fuller 'cause all I'm doing is changing plane. And they said, a friend of mine who taught at A-U [Atlanta University, Georgia], Carolyn Fowler said, "Val, where are you?" And I said, "What do you mean, where am I? I'm in Atlanta [Georgia]." She said, "We have been trying to call you all day long and your family is trying to call you." And I say, no, she didn't come to the phone. A student say, "It's Val Ward," so I heard her saying, "Well, let me come to the phone." I said, "No, I just wanted to talk to Hoyt [Fuller] because I'm--I don't have much time," and so she said, the student said, "But Ms. [Carolyn] Fowler want to speak to you 'cause we been trying to locate you all day." And something just went over me, the same as when Kumi (ph.) died, my grandson. I said, what do you mean? Today is whatever that day was and I said, he isn't at Cornell [University, New York], he should be home. I'm getting angry like, you know, and I could hear--and Carolyn [Fowler] came to the phone and she said, "Val, Hoyt [Fuller] is dead." And I can't tell you what that--you know I didn't' know to get on the plane or not get on the plane or whatever and I just--like what do you mean he's dead. He said, "Your family is trying to locate you. And will you call back and somebody will be at the airport to meet you." Hoyt [Fuller] was gone. Hoyt [Fuller] was gone. Story_ID: 72693 Speaker 1: And something similar happened to Gwendolyn Brooks and it's hard for me to talk about these people 'cause relationship does not define--she was my sister, my oldest sister. She was my friend 'cause she was almost as old as my mother, my confidant, and I was her confidant. And, when Gwendolyn [Brooks] was sick and I didn't know that she was sick 'cause she would just send me big bouquets of flowers and you just get these things or a little message saying keep looking up. And I had been to New York City and had dinner, Thanksgiving dinner with my niece who's lawyer and she was having--had a--she lived on, not Riverside Drive, downtown [New York], almost by where the thing-- and Gwendolyn [Brooks] looked wonderful dinner and we went back to Syracuse [University, New York] that next day, then had a football game. And so that Sunday, I called Gwendolyn [Brooks] and she didn't sound right. She said, "Hello, how are you?" Well, very few people had her private, private line and I said, "Gwendolyn," and she said, "Who is this?" And I said, "What do you mean, who is it?" And she kept saying, she said, "Well, I don't feel too good." And I said, when--do you--if you've eaten and she was saying, in about three days. And I said, she said, "Who is this?" And a word I say, and she said it on that thing--for national thing--television. I said, bullshit. And when I said, bullshit, she said, oh, Val. And, I said "Gwendolyn [Brooks], you're sick and where is Nora [Brooks Blakely]?" Who's there and she said, nobody's here and I said, "Well, I'm coming right now." And she says, "Well, I'm gone let you in." And I said, "I'm coming right now." So I tried to call Nora [Brooks Blakely] and Nora didn't answer and I'm not gone to tell you all of this story because it's really, really involved. But I called [HM] Lerone Bennett and I said, "Lerone, Gwendolyn is sick." He said, "Val, I know it"--at Ebony magazine. And I said, but I--somebody need--has to go over there. He said, "I've tried to go there." And Gloria, that's his wife, he'll try to go over there and she will not, you know. And I said, but Gwendolyn [Brooks] is that way. She doesn't like doctors. I had to get the doctor for her mother and have him come out there and that's in her autobiography when she died 'cause they wouldn't go to hospital. And I said, "But Gwendolyn [Brooks] is sick and I didn't know she was as sick as she is--was." This was on a Sunday and I called my mother. My mother, they took my mother to the hospital emergency that day. [HM] Sonia Sanchez, whom I talked to like twice a week, father died that day, that weekend, I had to get all my stuff together 'cause I got--now I gotta go to Mississippi and I gotta come here, right? I got on the train and came out here. [HM] Nikki [Giovanni] called me and Nikki said, Gwen[dolyn Brooks] is not--said I'm calling all them--she said, no, Gwen is alright because [HM] Sonia [Sanchez] and I are reading with Gwen[dolyn Brooks] at DuSable Museum [of African American History in Chicago, Illinois] on Saturday. I said, no, "Gwen can't read with anybody. Gwen is very ill." I arrived here on Saturday and I was gonna go the museum to hear Nikki and Sonia and I had just put my things down, my clothes down at Kenny's house, 53rd and Cornell and Makai called me screaming and cryin', she said, "Momma, Gwen is gone." I said, "What do you mean she's gone? She is not." She said "There is a thing on television with your arms around her." Well, I think that's her seventy-fifth birthday or whatever they had at the Cultural Center. "You and Nora [Brooks Blakely] have your arms and they have when she was born and when she"--I couldn't, I couldn't breathe. I couldn't believe it because it affected me the same way. I guess, my mother and my father and, if anything is a little bit more than that, it's Kumi (ph.) death, could have affected me more, like stop the world, I want to get off. Because not only had she written things about me, dedicated her first autobiography to me and [HM] Francis [Ward] and Haki [Madhubuti] and Dudley [Randall], but she'd written poems and when this--when I was nominated for this award at [Harvard University] Radcliff, Harvard, the letter is like unreal. Or when she introduced me for this award, theater award; I mean the things she said, beyond words, like "unkillable" and, you know, just--I just cannot tell you but she'll take a lot of things that I will never repeat to the grave and I will take for her those things that she shared because she was a friend and the best poet probably in the world and, like I do all the poets' works and I love them and I love her and Langston [Hughes], of course, lives in me 'cause I knew him long before and I knew the rest of them through, because I was exposed to him much earlier. But I don't have words to tell you--well, in the book, 'To Gwen With Love' that I had people put together and [HM] Francis [Ward] and [HM] Haki [Madhubuti] and friend of mine were the editor. I said, like "How do you build on a pyramid of truths?" That's what Gwendolyn Brooks was, is, 'cause she'll never die. Story_ID: 72694 Speaker 1: That's nice. Val, can I ask two--about two other people 'cause we need- Speaker 2: --Hmmmm hmmm. Speaker 1: [HM] Sonia Sanchez and [HM] Nikki Giovanni--short? Speaker 2: Again, I've known [HM] Nikki [Giovanni] since Nikki was a student at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and she has been my sister and my friend since that time. And she's a person that, I mean just looks out for me. 'Cause she'll say, half of the financial dues and the rest of the dues, you are doing and people should do. And she'll just book five or six things. She'll bring me to her school. She's at Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]. And she'll book all around there, the theater or something else, you know, and then, you know, I used to recharge what little money, one thousand dollars; not anymore. I'd say no, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that. [HM] Sonia [Sanchez], I talk to and [HM] Nikki [Giovanni] and [Amiri] Baraka, I can't leave him out either. All of us are very, very close and [HM] Sonia [Sanchez] got the Frost Award [2001] and [HM] Ruby Dee was honored at the University of Maryland. So we're constantly together and on the program and all of these programs, I'm always, you know, highlighted as one of the people and [HM] Sonia [Sanchez] got the Frost Award [2001] at NYU [New York University]. Then she got the [1999] Langston Hughes [Poetry] Award at City College [of New York] and all of us are always together. And it's not always the writers, you would think I hang with the--the pain is too--'cause me and Elizabeth Catlett, [HM] Sonia [Sanchez] and all of us. So, it's almost like the early days of the--when I was telling you that people just sort of meld together. That's what's happening now and particularly with my career, you know, at this age, you look around and you don't, you have all these awards and no money and few people are helping me to make money. [HM] Sonia [Sanchez] is not helping me to make money but, you know, she helps my soul and when I had the brain tumor and all that, they came up, you know or we'd go down to her house or, and [HM] Nikki [Giovanni]'s. I go all the time and Joanne (ph.) and sometimes the women writers get together in Wintergreen, Virginia, at the retreat. And I just missed it. And we just go there for like three days, just stay in that one place and people talk and not only do they share writings and family but what is happening to them as women or what is happening to them as their family and anything you need to talk about or cry about or laugh about, you know. And then we have massages and get in the hot tubs and all these things and that's really good. But I still miss Chicago [Illinois]. Yes. Story_ID: 72695 Speaker 1: Now when you look at black theater over the last, well, that's almost forty years, since your launching. It's gonna be forty years. Speaker 2: Hmmm hmmm Speaker 1: So, what do you--what are your thoughts about your both positive and negative, you know, and what you--do you see as the future? But what--when you look at, you know, what do you--what are you happy about in terms of its accomplishment and what do you- Speaker 2: Kuumba's accomplishments or other people? Speaker 1: I'm talkin' about black theater. Speaker 2: Oh, black theater? First, I like what other people are doing, like open casting and cross casting and so forth. And let me say this, if I just say that--I want to make sure that I put this in. That if I'm talking about--I mean when I'm talking about Kuumba surviving, it wasn't just black people that made Kuumba survive, it was a lot of white people; before people like Paul Wagner but before Paul, others, you know, that supported--one of my best friends, and I understand that he just died and nobody called and told me, was the founder of Columbia College [of Chicago, Illinois], [Norman] Alexandroff. It was Gwendolyn [Brooks] that introduced me to him. I would have never done 'Medium Cool' and I don't know if you know that 'Medium Cool' is now one of the hundred top films for the century, one of the hundred films ever made in America. It was through [Norman] Alexandroff when we were at Columbia College [Chicago, Illinois] and stayed there for free, over a year, over two years. It was [Norman] Alexandroff, you know. He was wonderful and I could just go on with so many, many other people that--and when I speak of--and it wasn't just black people that were the reason that Kuumba survived and I wanna include that. So I don't wanna sound, if somebody comes--when white student come and see this, oh, no. And we always cast white people but we cast them where we need 'em but people like Richard (unclear), like they tech and they did all the other things so, no. Speaker 1: But what about--what about the status of black theater? Are you- Speaker 2: I'm happy with what I hear locally that E-T-A [Creative Arts, Chicago, Illinois] and [HM] Jackie [Taylor] are doing in terms of administrative. And Joan was--oh, I shouldn't say Joan--(unclear) or [HM] Abena [Joan P. Brown], what am I supposed to say 'cause she always say, don't call me that-[HM] Abena [Joan P. Brown]. When I hear of the administrative things that they're doing, I think it's wonderful, when I hear of the creative things. Now they've brought in a lot of people, Vantile Whitfield, Kuumba brought in all these people years ago, you know, and that's wonderful. And so I'm glad of that and I understand that they're going to get a new building but I think the most important things is to build an institution that financially helps itself and can invest and do those kind of things but I would like to see--from what I have seen--oh, now watch me get in trouble. I've creatively is not necessarily the level, but I hear that Black Ensemble [Theater] is doing at least good business but some of the stuff I've seen from time to time, when I come, is not the level of creativity. So I would like to see it grow and people ascertain as much knowledge, both administratively as we do artistically and not, I mean just to do the very best at what we do and make sure we support each other, you know. But, which was, I think when I came here for Kuumba's thirty-fifth anniversary, I had--the Goodman [Theater] had to give me their black list and nothing's wrong with that 'cause the Goodman is always, you know. But if I wanted to buy costume--but we should do that to one another, you know. And in order for them to grow, we need to do that and we need to tell--if we're gonna be the truth of black history, then they have to tell about Kuumba and those theaters that were before Kuumba, Langston Hughes' theater and the rest of them. But Kuumba was first, certainly the oldest continuous black and the first professional [theater]. Story_ID: 72696 Speaker 1: But black theater black period--what are your thoughts about what black theater? Some people before said there was no black theater. Speaker 2: Who said that? Speaker 1: No, I'm just saying- Speaker 2: Okay, that's just you playing devil's advocate, right? There is no black theater. If there are black people, there's black theater but when cautiously black people put forth an effort to make sure that the truth is told about the stories. And I'm not anti-theater in general but I just think that it is necessary. It would be wrong for me to send my granddaughter to school or my sons or whatever and say, if we don't support you, you know. I've heard people say, well, I, I, I, no, I won't go to a black doctor or black lawyer and they will have gone to the same schools. So that's self-hatred. But somebody has to tell that story. And that's what Kuumba is about and that's why I am the voice of the black writer 'cause somebody has to make you laugh, cry, memorize and--can I just do a short piece and this is Jessie [Redmon] Fauset, who was responsible for Langston [Hughes]'s first publication. She does a short piece on Sojourner Truth and, of course, I added to the poems. You know I will do a little whatever. Anyway, she said--(humming), "Momma, how come you look up at the moon and starts and groan so? And she just--(humming). I looks up at the stars and groans. 'Cause I don't knows where my chilluns be and den dey don't knows where I be's. But, I couldn't look up at the stars and den dey could look up at the stars--(humming)." Her children had been stolen from her breasts and sold into slavery. The moans and groans I heard some of those people doing in Mound Bayou [Mississippi] or other churches. And so now if everything is dat-dat-and dat--if that is never done, it will never be heard. Or, we never did anything without doing, "[Langston Hughes, 'Note on Commercial Theater'] You've Taken My Blues And Gone. You sing 'em on Broadway, you sing 'em in Hollywood Bowl and you mix 'em up in symphonies. And you fix 'em so they don't even sound like me. Yeah, you've taken my blues and gone. You've taken my spirituals and gone. You put me in Macbeth and Carmen Jones and in all kinds of swing Mikados and everything but what's about me. But some day, someday, somebody's gonna stand up and talk about me, and sing about me and write about me and put on plays about me, black and beautiful. Well, I reckon it's gone be me, myself." Yeah. It's going to be me. And that says it, you know, that's how, that's why. And when I tell you I was at the University of Kansas and they brought over six hundred scholars from around the world, most of those scholars are three, or one-third of them or more, from around the world, were white, from Japan and all these other places. And not that they shouldn't be but then our people and our children, black and white and people need to know. Thank you. Speaker 1: Val, what did- Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): We gotta change tapes. Speaker 1: OH, shoot, okay, I just have a legacy question-- Story_ID: 72697 Speaker 1: I want to ask you- Speaker 2: How's my lipstick? Speaker 1: Fine, I think so, yeah. What do you want your legacy to be? Speaker 2: The truth of what I've--have done, have given or created. That's all I ask. Oooh, what's his name--Channel 7--a long time ago, asked me that question. And they were doing what--bring people in Chicago [Illinois] or something--said what do I want my legacy to be. I just want people to tell what I've done, whether they agreed or disagreed. And if they say that, they can. But no special praise or anything 'cause I had to do what I've done and what I'm doing. Speaker 1: And why did you have to do it? Speaker 2: I, I just that--because that's inside of me. The same as these people said that they're call, that is my ministry, that is my--if I couldn't create art, be mother and wife or fish as I do, I would be nothing. If I wouldn't be the kind of friend I am and if I didn't--I've got friends all over the world. And people say, no, you're--I say, no, I have friends. I'm rich that way. And so I know what I know about the art and it's serious with me. And when I get on stage or do it, I give my all, you know and that's all anybody can do. I want people to say is, you know, Val gave her all. I didn't disagree with it or I agreed with it sometimes, you know. Speaker 1: And Kuumba's legacy? Speaker 2: That Kuumba was an organization that lived by its motto and that's clean up, create and to build. And that it was always entertaining and educating. Speaker 1: You want to do that one more time? Speaker 2: Huh? Speaker 1: --without this. Speaker 2: Oh, my mind was someplace else. Oh, okay. I forgot we were recording. Speaker 1: Hmm hmm. Speaker 2: What did--what did you ask me? Speaker 1: I asked about Kuumba's legacy. Speaker 2: Kuumba's legacy? I hope will live forever, as long as there is a world and people will remember that the motto was "clean up, create and build." That we tried to put history through art and entertainment in its proper perspective. Story_ID: 72698 Speaker 1: And when you think, Val, as a young person that you were in Mound Bayou, and those early years and even your early years here in Chicago [Illinois], and the person that you've become and the institution that you created and the art form that you helped create, what do you think? Speaker 2: You know, I really don't--I like being on stage. I like doing people, characters and so forth but it's hard for me to take praise and I get it all the time because these people want to take a resume and oh, my goodness, they wanna talk about the commercials that I've done or all the other things and I'm really not about that. And even the art I created the most important thing about that is when somebody say, you touched me or you changed my life. Night before last, Rhonda and I went to the--I think it's Jamaican or in an island restaurant in Hyde Park [Chicago], across from the soul restaurant and we ran into Sue Conway and Brother Evon (ph.)--I don't know what his last name--but I remember that--and I wouldn't have remembered then, that he was a drug addict, right? And so he said, he was seventy-five, that was his birthday and Sue Conway, the singer, was taking him to dinner. He said, and when Sue heard your voice, she said, "Oh, that Sister Val," he said, she said, "That somebody really touched my life," and he said, "Let me tell you how she touched mine." So when we sat down, Rhonda, sue and I, he pulled up his sleeve. He said, "I used to be a drug addict and in prison and I was those"--one that--he's a drummer now and a musician. He's put out several records and everything. He said, "It is because sitting in Kuumba, watching the drug Rituals and the performances that you gave." This man had tears, a grown, white haired man and he said, "And I just wanted to thank you." And he started taking out these albums, that his--not albums, CDs--giving 'em to me and then he had written two plays and he said, and I didn't know anything about writing but I went back to school. And he said, "And you're responsible for that." He said, "And then you're here and it's my birthday." So Sue said, "Are you gonna let me in on part of this?" And she talked about when her child was--Joy--her last baby--how she had to come to the theater with her clothes ready to go to the hospital because Val said, she had to--I had to do it and then brought Odetta [Odetta Felicia Gordon Holmes] in and Odetta had messed up, of course. Oh, I shouldn't say that. But anyway, Odetta is one of those people we produced and we talked about that and she was talkin' about that and she was talking about--she said, talk to anybody that's over thirty, that's doing anything today, Bernard Nixon, whomever, and see where they got their professional start of where they just started from Billy Branch to Valerie Wellington or just talk, or go to Hollywood and talk to John Tolbay (ph.) or these people today, they'll say they're the bachelors. She say, where they get the start, you know, and so, when other talk about that, that goes to my heart, but otherwise. Oh, I did my shoulders that way again. Story_ID: 72699 Speaker 1: Just one last question. What is--what do you think of the beauty of black people are? Speaker 2: Oh, thank you. I can close with Langston Hughes again. I want to really close but before that, he said, "We are both ugly and beautiful too." He also said, "The night is beautiful, so are the eyes of my people. The stars are beautiful, so are the faces of my people, beautiful also is the sun, beautiful also are the souls of my people. We are both beautiful and ugly, too, because we're just human beings in this world." Story_ID: 72700 Speaker 1: That's a photograph of me and I think it was after a production, maybe at 22nd Street, I really can't tell you but I know that Doyle Wicks did the photograph. VIDEOGRAPHER: Do you know approximately what year? Speaker 1: I guess in the early '80s [1980s] or '70s [1970s]--80s [1980s], I would say. Speaker 2: Photograph and it's wonderful because [Mayor] Harold Washington was not only one of our greatest supporters before he became mayor and after he became mayor but he was welcoming us back from Montreal [Canada], from the Montreal Jazz Festival and it was the first time that 'Cabaret' play had ever been put into the Jazz Festival. And the people there, Laura Walls and Sonny- VIDEOGRAPHER: Can you name them from right to left. Speaker 2: From right to left? Oh, I can't think of this one trumpet player's name, I think he's dead now. And the other person is--so many people are dead--he's a piano player and he's dead but that's Katherine Davis, the blues singer. She's popular in Chicago [Illinois]. Next to him is Marv--Marshall Titus, next to [Mayor] Harold [Washington] is my youngest daughter, Rhonda. And if you want Harold, here's Harold. That's [Mayor] Harold Washington and next to him is Laura Walls, who was playing Billie Holiday. Next to him is Sonny Seals. Next to Sonny is Collette, the singer and stylist and piano player and, of course, Val [Gray] Ward. And that was in city hall. We were just coming back from the Montreal Jazz Festival, where we got top, top awards. VIDEOGRAPHER: And that's left to right? Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: You know the year? Speaker 2: Oh, the first time we played the Montreal Jazz Festival [Canada]--hmmm hmmm. There's a piece there that has the--from the, the--this was--was this in Japan? VIDEOGRAPHER: (Unclear). Speaker 2: Yes, it's from the production of, I think, 'Jazz and Mo Jazz'. Oh, gosh, I know all of these people but [Carl Donneell] "Kansas" Fields who has the sticks and the--in the center and [HM] Sonny Turner on the end. That's a blues singer--if I start from left to right, oh, God, he's dead now but a piano player, played many times with me. And the man standing next to him is one of the art teachers--oh, no, no, no, that's a play that--no, no, that's not the play I wrote. And, oh, I can't, I can't. I've forgotten some of these names. They're gonna kill me but all of these are Chicago [Illinois] musicians and one blues musician. So either it was a production we were doing at the theater or that could be when I told you about Penn and Teller. And I produced them at the opera house for the Chicago Sun Times. That's all I can tell you about that. VIDEOGRAPHER: Do you remember any one thing? Speaker 2: Kansas Fields is the guy in the--with the stick in his--drumstick in his hand. VIDEOGRAPHER: In the center? Speaker 2: Yeah, in the center. And the--Oh, God, I mean these people that I've taken to Japan and every place and on the far, I guess, no, left to me. No, am I going left to right? VIDEOGRAPHER: (Unclear) describe screen. Speaker 2: Yeah, well to my- VIDEOGRAPHER: This would be left. Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but to right, far right is Sonny Seals, not Sonny Seals, [HM] Sonny Turner, the trumpet player. VIDEOGRAPHER: Far right? Speaker 2: Yes. VIDEOGRAPHER: Alright, and do you know what happened--what year this is? Speaker 2: I don't know if that's [HM] Earl [Neal]--oh, yeah, I think that's Earl--can I get my--can you get my glasses? Speaker 1: (Unclear) Speaker 2: Since I'm--my glasses are out there--and, oh, what is that boy's name? He's dead. And that's not Earl. Oh, as many times--and I took that--(unclear) Japan twice. Speaker 1: Well, just try to identify who you can. Speaker 2: No, I can't identify anybody but Kansas [Fields] and John Logan is the first person to the left. Oh, God, I saw that man's wife the other day. Oh, I can't--ahhh, and that's Kansas Fields with the--he played with Sidney Bechet and all the old timers. He played in Paris for years but he played for me. And this is a blues singer standing next to Kansas. This young man with the trombone, I don't know he--who he is but I know him but he was filling in for someone else. And standing next to him is the great [HM] Sonny Turner.

I had Babtunde [Olatunji] make this gold Kuumba logo for my husband. I said, oh, how could I forget it? I said, "Darling, I'll give you your piece when you get home." And I just said this out in the audience. I just said this, right? And he said, "I know you gonna give me the piece when you get home."

The young man to his left is my second oldest son, that's Kenneth. He's an old man now and Kenneth played drums and sitting at the piano is Ernest, who is one of the greatest dancers, Ernest Snyder. And we used to do all of these drug rituals and anti-drug and he used to dance this piece called Brah and that's also at the Southside Art Center, 3831 South Michigan [Avenue, Chciago, Illinois]. And I think that piano is the piano that Gwendolyn Brooks had given to us. VIDEOGRAPHER: Describe this photograph for me. Speaker 2: Okay, that's me during the '60s [1960s].

And the person in the background there, her name is Thelma. She's gonna get up and do something, you know, impromptu. But this woman thought that when we were doing the first part of the ritual, which was the church, and everybody was getting up testifying, she got up and started to testify too. And I later, I--in the interview, I talked about these people from the outside, almost took over the ritual, and I had to get it back where she just, just was praising and having this testimony. So she was just somebody from the community at 38th and Michigan. But it was wonderful. VIDEOGRAPHER: Describe this photograph. Speaker 1: That's the same woman, Julie.
